<p>The 200th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast will be on June 8th, 2013.  The 100th episode of the podcast was our first live video broadcast, and we feel that episode #200 should be even more memorable for everyone involved.  </p>
<p>Yes, episode #200 will be broadcast live on the morning of June 8th, but what will set this apart from #100?  You can be here!  That's right, we're making a weekend of it.  We're inviting all of you to the Relentless Podcast Network World Headquarters.  Will you be spending the entire weekend in the studio?  No way.  </p>
<p>Relentless Podcast Network HQ sits on 20 acres near Galesburg, Illinois.  We are inviting all of you to a camping weekend to help us celebrate.  RPN sits on a 13 acre private lake and plenty of space to do whatever you want.  You're welcome to fish or swim.  We have a couple of boats, including a paddle-boat, if you want to cruise the lake.  If camping isn't your thing, there's the house to sleep, shower and shit in.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/138393423005544/">Please RSVP on our Facebook event (even if you are considering coming).</a>  </p>
<p>So here are the details:</p>
<p><strong>Friday June 7th</strong><br />
We'll be traveling to Burlington, Iowa (about 45 minutes away) to watch the Kane County Cougars (Cubs Low-A affiliate) take on the Burlington Bees (Angels).  I have spoken with Burlington about renting a suite for the game.  RSVP on our Facebook page and we can discuss if we want general admission or the suite.  </p>
<p><strong>Saturday June 8th</strong><br />
We'll start the live broadcast of the 200th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  It will be broadcast world-wide and you can sit in the studio while we broadcast.  At 3pm, we will head into Galesburg to watch the Cubs at Duffy's.  Duffy's is a hole-in-the-wall Cubs bar that has $3 pitchers of Old Style.  We'll be the only people under 65 years old and a lot of skeptical eyebrow raises will be sent in our direction.  But these people love the Cubs and we will probably bring in the biggest crowd the establishment has ever seen.  </p>
<p>After the game, we'll return to the lake for a fish fry.  </p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong><br />
Go the hell home so we can clean up the mess.</p>
