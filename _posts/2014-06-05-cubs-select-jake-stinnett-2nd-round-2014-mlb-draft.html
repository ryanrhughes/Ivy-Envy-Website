<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/Jake-Stinnett.jpeg"><img src="/uploads/2014/06/Jake-Stinnett-300x200.jpeg" alt="Jake Stinnett" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10074" /></a>After drafting what many considered to be the best college bat available in the first round, the Cubs began the expected stockpiling of pitchers in the 2nd round.  </p>
<p>With the 45th overall pick, the Cubs selected RHP, Jake Stinnett a senior from Maryland.  He was drafted in 2013 by the Pirates (29th round) but chose to not sign.  </p>
<p>Stinnett is 6'4", 215 lbs. and features a fastball, slider and change-up.  His fastball sits at 92-94mph and has good movement.  He projects to be a #3/#4 starter.  Stinnett had time in the infield and as a reliever before becoming a starter in 2013.  This means he has less wear-and-tear and pitches on his arm than your typical college senior. </p>
<p>Like the selection of Kyle Schwarber in the 1<sup>st</sup> round, it's expected that the Stinnett would sign and under-slot deal, giving the Cubs more flexibility in later rounds.  Baseball America had Stinnett ranked #67.  </p>
