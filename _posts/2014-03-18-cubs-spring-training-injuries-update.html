<p>On <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/12-story-lines-cubs-2014-spring-training-with-brett-bleacher-nation-podcast-episode-6-01/" target="_blank">Episode 6.01</a> of our podcast, we discussed our top story-lines for Spring Training this year with the Cubs. One of my top story-lines was the ability of Cubs players to stay healthy. No Cubs players have suffered serious or season-ending injuries, but the team has suffered a few bumps and bruises.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Starlin Castro</span></strong><br />
For the second Spring Training in a row, Starlin Castro tweaked his hamstring within the first few days of game action. After leaving the March 2nd game, the Cubs said they expected Castro to be out 7-10 days. It's now been 16 games and Castro has not returned to the lineup. Castro says he is running at 80% now and should be ready for Opening Day. I don't doubt that, at his age, Castro won't require much training to get ready for the regular season. On the other hand, I think it's important that Castro is feeling 100% on Opening Day. Castro wants to play every day and there's no sense in entering the season banged up, so getting healed up now is probably a good idea.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mike Olt</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+f_TacDLqnzYl.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9110" alt="Mike Olt" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+f_TacDLqnzYl-213x300.jpg" width="213" height="300" /></a>Mike Olt has been a pleasant surprise at the plate this Spring. Based on his limited plate appearances, it appears as though the Cubs front office may be getting out of Olt what they hoped after serious questions were raised about his future because of his eye issues and performances in 2012 and 2013. I say that he's played well this Spring Training, but it hasn't been at 3<sup>rd</sup> base. Olt has suffered from a sore shoulder, which is impacting his ability to throw from 3<sup>rd</sup> base. He was supposed to play at the hot corner in Monday's game vs. the Angels, but was scratched. The latest is that Olt could play the position tonight, so this is not a huge concern.</p>
<p>At the plate, Olt has shown he's capable of breaking camp with the Cubs. On this last episode, we talked about the "twig jam" (as opposed to log jam) with Valbuena, Donnie Murphy, Barney and Bonafacio this would cause. While Cubs fans would welcome the fire-power that Olt can provide, sending him to Iowa to start the season may give them time to make decisions on the rest of the infielders and potentially find suitors for Darwin Barney.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jake Arrieta</span></strong><br />
It appeared that Arrieta would be at the back end of the starting rotation for the Cubs as they headed into Spring Training. Once the Cubs reported to Mesa, we found out that Arrieta experienced some discomfort in his shoulder over the winter and his spring has been delayed. The <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/chicago/cubs/post/_/id/21978/arrieta-faces-hitters-for-first-time" target="_blank">latest on Arrieta</a> is that he threw live batting practice on Sunday. He reportedly threw 63 total pitches (warm-up and BP) and Arietta felt like his velocity was at about 80%. It appears that Arietta will probably start the season on the disabled list. If he gets a start or two in Iowa after that, we could see Arrieta with the Cubs late April or early May.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">James McDonald</span></strong><br />
That brings us to James McDonald, the player it looked like would replace Arietta in the rotation. As we talked about on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/twig-jam-infield-podcast-episode-6-05/" target="_blank">this week's episode of the podcast</a>, Jimmy Mac has not been #RippinLips this spring.<br />

<p>McDonald's first few outings were rough. According to MLB.com, in his first 3 appearances and 5 2/3 innings of work, McDonald threw 92 pitches and only 38 were strikes. Watching McDonald on the mound, it was clear he wasn't comfortable and had great difficulty finding the plate. McDonald is included in this post because he exited Monday's game vs. the Angels <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-17/sports/chi-james-mcdonald-leaves-with-injury-20140317_1_chicago-cubs-manager-rick-renteria-darwin-barney" target="_blank">after throwing just two pitches</a>. McDonald left the game with a sore shoulder. With the Pirates in 2013, McDonald went to the DL in early May because of the shoulder and did not return to the big league club. At this point, it seems that Chris Rusin is probably the front-runner for the #5 spot in the rotation.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cubs Spring Training injuries have not been as bad as we've seen in other years. The next week should clarify some of these "bumps and bruises" situations.</p>
<p>***EDIT***<br />
