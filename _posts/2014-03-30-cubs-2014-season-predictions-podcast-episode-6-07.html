    I'll take the over on the Castro errors, but I don't think they'll be as hideous as the ones he made last year.&nbsp;
    I'll go under on the Ricky ejejctions, Olt RBI, Olt Ks, but over on the Rizzo average.

    Just got a chance to finish listening to the podcast this morning. This was a great one guys, keep it up. Tons of good info, some fun predictions, and some good laughs. Really enjoyed this week and looking forward to more in the future. Who do you guys think has a higher batting average this year, Rizzo or Castro?
    here are my predictions for the over/under:
    Mike Olt RBIs &ndash; Over/Under is 80: Under
    Anthony Rizzo Batting Average &ndash; Over/Under is .270: Under
    Jeff Samardzija Wins &ndash; Over/Under is 13: Over
    Rick Renteria Ejections &ndash; Over/Under is .5: Under
    First Trade of the Season &ndash; Before/After May 1: Over
    More MLB HRs This Year &ndash; Barney, Baez, Travis Wood: Baez
    Date Samardzija is Traded &ndash; Before/After July 4: After
    Kris Bryant 1st MLB At-Bat &ndash; Before/After September 3, 2014: After
    Starlin Castro Errors &ndash; Over/Under is 21: Under
    Will Any Cubs Pitchers Have Double Digit Win Totals?: Yes 2
    Total Cubs with BA of at Least .275 with 350 ABs &ndash; Over/Under is 2: Over
    Players on Cubs Big League Roster in 2014 &ndash; Over/Under is 55.5: Under
    Junior Lake HRs &ndash; Over/Under is 10: Over
    Junior Lake RBIs &ndash; Over/Under is 70: Under
    Jason Hammel&rsquo;s Win Total &ndash; Over/Under is 7: Over
    Jason Hammel&rsquo;s ERA &ndash; Over/Under is 3.25: Over
    Mike Olt&rsquo;s Strikout Total &ndash; Over/Under is 120: Over

Andy, Corey and Kurt go through a list of listener-submitted Cubs and Cubs player over/under predictions. All of the categories are listed at the end of this post. We'd like to hear your predictions for these. Leave them in the comments area of this post.</p>
<p>The Cubs announced that Carlos Villanueva will be the #5 starter until Jake Arrieta returns. Corey wrote a post earlier in the week about Javier Baez and when we might see him called up to the Cubs and how the Super Two status plays into all of this. So he explains the Super Two situation. If you haven't heard of Super Two status or it hasn't been clear to you what it is, Corey puts it into pretty simple terms.</p>
