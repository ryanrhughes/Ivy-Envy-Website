  content: I have DirectTV, and for less than 50 bucks I was able to buy a digital
    antenna. &nbsp;This allows me to watch the games on 8.3. &nbsp;The only problem
    is that I can't use my DVR, but &nbsp;I can live with that.

The&nbsp;<em>Quad City Times&nbsp;</em>reported earlier today that the local CW affiliate, KGCW, <a href="http://qctimes.com/sports/baseball/kgcw-picks-up-remaining-cubs-games/article_ccb3b464-1782-54e4-898b-5042bd1434c1.html" target="_blank">will be airing 24 Cubs games this season</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This announcement effectively ends the concern many Quad Cities Cubs fans had over how they were going to be able to watch their favorite team this season. &nbsp;Mediacom subscribers will find KGCW on channel 713, and it is channel 26 for OTA viewers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Comcast SportsNet sent out a press release yesterday, stating that <a href="http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2015/03/24/comcast-sportsnet-announces-its-2015-chicago-cubs-on-aironline-coverage-details/" target="_blank">it will broadcast 87 games this season</a>--"the most in network history," and earlier this month, we reported that <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wqad-to-air-45-cubs-games-in-2015/" target="_blank">45 games will be aired by WQAD's My TV 8-3 substation</a>. </p>
<p>The few remaining games out of the 162 <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/broadcasts/national.jsp?c_id=chc" target="_blank">will be split between ESPN and FOX</a>.</p>

<p>Dave raises a great point.  If you have DirecTV, you do not have WQAD's 8.3 substation. I could not find anything that indicates DISH carries the station.  </p>
