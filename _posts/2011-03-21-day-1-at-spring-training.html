<p>It is becoming pretty clear to us that we will have a difficult time blogging about everything we are experiencing here in Mesa. &nbsp;If you read the blog, I'd encourage you to play the podcast episodes that we are posting. &nbsp;We will try to keep them short and concise for you.</p>
<p>Our first day exceeded our expectations in a huge way. &nbsp;Some incredible seats led to a great view of the game and some interaction with the players. &nbsp;If you want seats here in Mesa with a great view and player interaction, check out <a href="http://www.springtrainingexperience.com">SpringTrainingExperience.com</a></p>
<p>Listen to Episode 3.08 to hear:<br />
* Overall description of the Spring Training vibe.<br />
* Recap of Sunday's walk-off win.<br />
* Kurt's story of snagging Mike Fontenot's errant throw into the stands in the 1st inning.<br />
* Marlon Byrd's dedication to the fans.<br />
* Interaction with the players after the game.</p>
<p>Today's events are a little up-in-the-air. &nbsp;They are calling for rain here in the Valley of the Sun. &nbsp;After today, the weather looks great though. &nbsp;The forecast says 72-75 degrees and sunny for the rest of our stay out here.</p>
<p>We will be posting lots of photos and doing podcasts every evening, but written descriptions of our experiences will be sparse. &nbsp;And of course, if you want immediate updates from us, follow us on Twitter - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy">@IvyEnvy</a>.</p>
