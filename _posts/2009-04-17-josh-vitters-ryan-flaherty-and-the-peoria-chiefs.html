excerpt: "Last night, the Single A Cubs affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs came to the Quad
  Cities to face our hometown River Bandits, which is a Cardinals affiliate.&nbsp;
  The Peoria roster is a little more loaded right now than usual.&nbsp; Josh Vitters
  and Ryan Flaherty are currently occupying the left side of the infield for the Chiefs.&nbsp;
  For those of you not familiar with them, Vitters is the #3 overall 2007 draft pick.&nbsp;
  He's considered the #1 prospect in the Cubs farm system.&nbsp; Flaherty is ranked
  as the #8 Cubs prospect.&nbsp; Other notable names with Peoria right now are Chris
  Carpenter (no, not that one), Chris Archer (came to the Cubs in the Derosa trade)
  and Michael Brenly (son of Cubs TV broadcaster, Bob Brenly).\r\n\r\nI will post
  some pictures here and mention a few things I saw, but I'll leave most of the analysis
  to Kurt.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a beautiful night for a game.&nbsp; Any evening game
  in April that has a game-time temperature of 65 degrees is a good thing.&nbsp; Before
  I get into the actual on-field play, I have to share&nbsp; a few of my off-field
  experiences.\r\n\r\nFirst, it was \"College Night\" with $2 drafts.&nbsp; There
  were lots of college kids.&nbsp; It was starting to get more rowdy when I left in
  the 7th inning.&nbsp; I think the beer must have been left over from last season
  because it tasted awful.&nbsp; We also had this wacky lady sitting behind us that
  had some great insight into the game.&nbsp; When Carpenter was pulled, she stated
  \"Oh, it looks like they're bringing in another starter\".&nbsp; However, my favorite
  situation with her was when she blew a gasket when Josh Vitters took first base
  after he struck out, but&nbsp; the ball got away from the catcher.&nbsp; Vitters
  ended up safe at first.&nbsp; She was baffled at how Vitters could take first base
  after striking out and screamed to the \"ref\" about how bad he was.\r\n\r\nThe
  Chiefs were late to town because of a high school game at Modern Woodmen Park.&nbsp;
  Because of this, they did not take batting practice.&nbsp; I was able to observe
  the warmups.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_580\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"

  content: Thanks for mentioning the crazy lady. She was a season ticket holder. When
    Vitters took the base on the strikeout she yelled "Thats not fair". She also has
    a cowbell and wasn't afraid to use it. Bruce Dickinson would have been proud.

  content: Corey - after you left, some "College Night" kids sat behind us and were
    quite amused with the crazy lady. I crossed my right leg over my left as I turned
    back to tell them that whatever she had done at that moment was nothing - - -
    try sitting in front of her the whole game. As I was doing this, that darn right
    leg knocked the finally-found "good" beer out of the cup holder and all over the
    ground. Ah, Karma.

<p>I did not converse with the players much during warm-ups.&nbsp; Though I did have a small discussion with&nbsp; Josh Whitlock (right-handed pitcher) about the fact that all of the Chiefs players had high socks.&nbsp; He said it is a Cubs organization thing for all minor league squads.</p>
