<p>One of my favorite non-Cubs pitchers is Randy Johnson and I'm really excited that he is going against the Cubs this afternoon.&nbsp; Hopefully the rain&nbsp;moves out and they get the game in today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't like Randy Johnson much when he was in Seattle.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-68"></a>But he played for the Diamondbacks when I lived in Arizona and I developed an appreciation for him then.&nbsp; In fact, I&nbsp;was in attendance when&nbsp;Johnson strike out 18 or 19 batters at what was then called Bank One Ballpark.&nbsp; Fellow Ivy Envy writer Andy was there with me, I believe.&nbsp; Coincidentally, Andy has tickets to today's ballgame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the fact that the Cubs are facing Randy Johnson should put the fear of God in us.&nbsp; Johnson has owned the Cubs like Lou Holtz owned the University of Southern California.&nbsp; Johnson is 12-0 lifetime against the Cubs.&nbsp; But Randy Johnson isn't what he used to be.&nbsp; He doesn't have that 100mph fastball and he's 44 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, he's going up against Carlos Zambrano.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So let's hope for no rain.&nbsp; Let's hope Zambrano has a stellar performance.&nbsp; And let's hope that we finally get Randy Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
