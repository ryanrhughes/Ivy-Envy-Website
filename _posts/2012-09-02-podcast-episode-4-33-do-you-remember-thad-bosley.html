<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy discuss Darwin Barney's accomplishment of setting the NL 2nd base consecutive errorless games streak and his chances of winning the Gold Glove.  The Cubs have finalized their deal with Starlin Castro and we recap some of our opinions on this deal.  </p>
<p>We can't seem to get too excited about September call-ups this year.  We check up with Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters and their progress.  The Cubs announce who, from their organization, will be participating in the Arizona Fall League.  We comment on a few of the players.  Jeremy and Corey both made it to Peoria Chiefs games on what will probably be their last home-stand as a Cubs affiliate.  </p>
<p>We go over a few listener-submitted topics and questions and then pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
