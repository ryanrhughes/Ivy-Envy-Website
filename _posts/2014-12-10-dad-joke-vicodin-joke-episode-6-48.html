<p>Welcome to the 285<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast. Holy cow, the Cubs gave us a ton to talk about this week.  First off...Jon Lester!  The Cubs were able to sign the free agent to the largest contract in organization history.  We talk about Lester and what his signing means for this off-season and the 2015 season.  What it boils down to is that the Cubs are now interesting at the major league level.  </p>
<p>The Cubs also signed Jason Hammel, after trading him to A's with Jeff Samardzija in July.  The Cubs and Hammel must have liked what they saw in each other as they worked out a 2-year deal.  </p>
<p>The Cubs added an All-Star catcher in Miguel Montero.  After missing out on Russell Martin, they went out and got the catcher that is arguably the best pitch framer in baseball.  What does this mean for Welington Castillo? And how bad is he, really?</p>
<p>Kurt runs through the players whose contracts were tendered and non-tendered by the Cubs.  Corey reads some internet muscle flexes that left Andy and Kurt speechless.  </p>
<p>We have two Cubs Convention passes to give away, courtesy of the Chicago Cubs.  For a chance to win these two convention passes, email corey@ivyenvy.com with your answer to this question - Who would you bring with you to Cubs Convention and why?</p>
<p>We didn't have time to read the captions for this week's caption contest.  You can click on the image below and tell us which caption you liked most.  </p>
