  content: The cubs are weak sauce and will not score nine runs the entire Easter
    weekend in Milwaukee!

<p>I couldn't resist titling this post with a bad sports page headline. I also can't resist analyzing a few stats of spring training. It's been exactly one month and I've been holding off, telling myself "it's just spring training, don't get too caught up in stats". But I have to share my delight in the Cubs' scoring aptitude.&nbsp; The Cubs have played 29 games as of today (March 25) if you count the game vs. Japan. In those 29 games they have averaged 6.59 runs per game.&nbsp;For comparison sake the Brewers are averaging 5.6 and the Cards 6 runs per game. When the Cubs win they are scoring 9.13 runs per game. In their last ten games they have averaged 9.5. They laid down 20 on Oakland on Monday and 9 on Colorado yesterday. Micah Hoffpauir and Jake Fox lead the team with 13 runs a piece.</p>
<p>Spring training run totals are going to be skewed upward, but with less than two weeks until opening day this kind of offense is a good sign.</p>
