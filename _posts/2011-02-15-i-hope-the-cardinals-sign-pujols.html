  content: "Excellent piece.\r\n\r\nI think what a lot of people seem to be forgetting
    here is that COMPARED TO OTHER PLAYERS OF HIS SKILL SET Albert has been very much
    underpaid.  \r\n\r\nAs a Cubs fan, I wouldn't mind seeing them lock in a 31 year
    old guy for a decade even if he is healthy right now.   It would benefit us in
    the long run.\r\n\r\nNow, it would KILL us in the short run, but in all honesty,
    what's our plan for the next three years anyway?  Baseball is a sport where it's
    pretty easy to forecast teams' skill levels and right around the time Albert's
    skills really begin to decline, we'll just be on our way up.  \r\n\r\nI realize
    that you aren't comparing Pujols to Soriano, but look at it this way:  Albert
    is a first baseman.  Soriano is...well, not.  You can get any jackass to play
    (or not play) the outfield, but it takes dedication to defense to play first base.
    \ \r\n\r\nOrel Hershiser made an interesting point on Baseball Tonight the other
    day:  Think about how many of the players of the past all had their home runs
    and RBI decline after age 30.  The example he used was Mike Schmidt, and that
    was even WITH all of the amphetamines he was taking.  It's a vaild argument so
    I can understand the stubbornness from the STL management.  \r\n\r\nWhat do the
    rest of you guys think?\r\n\r\nMeehan"

    get me wrong, I DO NOT like the Cardinals, but I'm glad Pujols plays for them.
    We get to watch, and hate, one of the greatest players ever. You know he's good
    because of that anxious feeling you get when he steps up to the plate. I hope
    he stays in in the city of Busch. \r\n\r\nThe only good that would come from him
    playing for the Cubs is a reduction in racist t-shirt sales."

    know what Kurt is talking about because he gives off this constant aroma of intimidation.
    \ Even the way he sets into his stance frightens the hell out of me. (even when
    I'm watching them play the Astros)\r\n\r\nHe is probably the greatest hitter our
    generation has ever seen, but the fact that nobody hits .400 anymore leads me
    to believe that Ted Williams will always be the greatest.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>If you are paying attention to Spring Training baseball, you probably know that Albert Pujols is (figuratively) standing outside the chain link fence at the Cardinals' practice field in Jupiter, Florida with one arm in the air, tapping on his wristwatch.  Pujols has told the Cardinals that they have until 12 noon EST on Wednesday to agree on a new deal.  If the deal is not inked, Pujols will end negotiations on the contract until the 2011 season is over.  Pujols can become a free agent after the 2011 World Series.</p>
<p>Pujols is set to earn around $30 million a year.  The sticking point appears to be the length of the contract.  It's being reported that tonight, the Cardinals offered Pujols an 8 year deal.  However, it's quite clear that Pujols wants 10 years.  That would eclipse Alex Rodriguez's 10 year, $275 million contract as the largest in baseball.  Sidenote, remember when Ryne Sandberg held the largest contract in baseball with his $7.1 million/year contract?</p>
<p>I haven't discussed this situation with many Cubs fans and I wonder what you all are thinking.  I had a conversation with a good Cubs fan (good because he reads the site and listens to the podcast) today and it got me thinking.  This situation has to be nerve-wrecking for the front office of a medium market team that has now been forced by Matt Holliday and Albert Pujols to spend like the Yankees.  This is how I picture Cardinals GM John Mozeliak and his assistants, evaluating the situation.</p>
<p><center>[caption id="attachment_3842" align="aligncenter" width="349" caption=""Damn, we&#39;re in a tight spot.""]<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/george_clooney6.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3842" title="george_clooney6" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/george_clooney6.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="238" /></a>[/caption]</center></p>
<p>Pujols is in his 10th season with the Cardinals and it's difficult to imagine locking a player up for 10 years.  The Rockies gave Troy Tulowitzki a 10 year deal in the off-season, but Pujols is 31 years old, nearly half of such a contract older than Tulowitzki.  Pujols is an incredible baseball player.  He's worthy of being the best paid in baseball, as he is most likely the best baseball player we will live to see.  If he is PED-free, I think in a decade, the case could be made he's the best in the history of the game.</p>
<p>Is it smart baseball business to give a 31 year old a 10-year contract?  Especially a 10 year contract that amounts to $30 million a year.  Does it make sense to pay a player that kind of money over that length of time, knowing that most, if not all of those years are the backside of his career?  I do think we've seen the best of his career.  That's not to say Pujols will be a wash over the next 10 years, but his skills must diminish.</p>
<p>Facing this decision is a team that had a payroll of $94 million in 2010.  Holliday is set to earn $17 million through 2016.  If the Cardinals sign Pujols, it's safe to say that they will be forced to cut into their pitching staff (Carpenter, Wainwright) and just about every other position on the field.  Does this organization want to sacrifice everything for two big (aging) names?</p>
<p>Today, I also spoke with a co-worker that is a Cardinals fan.  Ivy Envy trivia fact: He's the voice-over for our podcast intro.  He's so professional that he can do a voice-over of that quality through clenched teeth, feigning excitement over the Cubs.  My impression of his feelings is that he won't be happy, whichever way this negotiation goes.  He wants Pujols to stay and retire in St. Louis.  However, he also realizes that the Cardinals are selling their future to ensure this happens.</p>
<p>If I was a Cardinals fan, I would not want them to make this move and dedicate that money and time to Pujols.&nbsp; But I'm not a Cardinals fan.&nbsp; I would love to see the team enter into another long and big money contract.&nbsp; While the contract will not hurt the Cardinals much in the short-term, I think it will long-term.&nbsp; Signing Pujols does not make the Cardinals more likely to win the World Series - he's already on the team.&nbsp; Not signing Pujols does make them less likely to win the World Series, though.&nbsp; So I think, from a Cubs fan's perspective, this situation is a win-win.&nbsp; The Cardinals either (hopefully) hurt the organization long-term, or they lose the best player in baseball.&nbsp; This situation would be entirely different if the Cardinals were a good team and looking to add a free agent Pujols for that push to win it all.</p>
<p>While I do not take this seriously,<a href="http://twitter.com/SI_JonHeyman/status/37362528908480512" target="_blank"> this tweet</a> from Jon Heyman sent shivers up my spine.&nbsp; I think that after the Soriano contract, the Cubs would be hesitant to jump into a larger contract.&nbsp; I am not putting Soriano and Pujols in the same category.&nbsp; The backside of Pujols' career will be much more impressive (though less hoppy) than Soriano's.  I would be shocked to see the Cubs make a push for Pujols.  </p>
<p>So I'm just going to sit back and watch this thing unfold.&nbsp; If a deal is not inked by tomorrow, I can only imagine that it will be a distraction throughout this season.&nbsp; Hey, there's another win for me.&nbsp; So this is potentially a win/win or win/win situation.  Of course, I thought Mark McGwire as the hitting coach would be a distraction and it seemed like the organization handled that situation.&nbsp; This situation is bigger though, and while Albert will brush them aside, he will face questions and speculation daily.&nbsp; This deal being delayed until November will sure keep the columnists in St. Louis busy.</p>
<p>So I want to hear your opinions on this contract negotiation.  As a Cubs fan, what do you want to see happen?</p>
