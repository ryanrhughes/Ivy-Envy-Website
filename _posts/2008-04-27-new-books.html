<p><strong>I Remember Harry Caray</strong> is a book of short columns written by Harry's family, baseball players and "people", broadcasting partners and coworkers, entertainers and fans. If the writing is half as interesting as some of the pictures in this book, it will be quite entertaining.</p>

<strong>Ron Santo - For Love of Ivy</strong> is Ron's autobiography. Now tell me, could anyone tell Ron's story like he can? Any guy that can work that hard to get himself into the Hall of Fame can surely write a tremendous book about himself. Don't get me wrong, I like Ron. He's just a self-promoter is all.</p>
