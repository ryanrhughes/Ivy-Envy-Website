  Apparently, all Jim Edmonds needs to do is pass a physical and he'll be a member of the Chicago Cubs.&nbsp; I have disliked Jim Edmonds for years.&nbsp; I'm sure he's thrilled to be reunited with Jason Marquis (see below).

  content: Well, it would have been great to add Edmonds and subtract Marquis; one
    ex cardinal is enough on any cubbies team. Just how good can Tony's rejects be.
    Oh well, time will tell;

<p>Apparently, all Jim Edmonds needs to do is pass a physical and he'll be a member of the Chicago Cubs.&nbsp; I have disliked Jim Edmonds for years.&nbsp; I'm sure he's thrilled to be reunited with Jason Marquis (see below).</p>

<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-74"></a>His highlight reel catches are a product of him being slow, he has to dive for nearly every ball hit to Center Field.&nbsp; I understand the need for power out of a lefty, but I really don't think Edmonds is the way to go.&nbsp; I hate to see Reed Johnson on the bench and he's the odd man out.&nbsp; Well, I guess Pie is literally the odd man out as he'll be sent back to Triple A Iowa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just don't feel that our lack of power out of a lefty is a massive issue right now.&nbsp; The fact we don't have a full rotation of starters seems to me to be a more pressing issue.</p>
<p>But if Jim Edmonds wears blue pinstripes, I will root him on.&nbsp; It's going to be hard for me to stomach.&nbsp; Besides Barry Bonds and AJ Pierzynski, Jim Edmonds is probably my least favorite player.&nbsp;&nbsp;He is&nbsp;playing so poorly that he was cut by the worst team in baseball, but apparently Jim Hendry has a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they say, Jim "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".&nbsp; We're scoring runs just fine.</p>
