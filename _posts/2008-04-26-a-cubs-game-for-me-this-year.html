  content: Andy-  Although Tim Timmons would be a sweet and logical choice for someone
    named Tim.. after much deliberation, I decided that Hunter Wendelstedt would be
    a better choice.  In addition to leading the league in ejections, he also  has
    a great name.

<p>My wife and I are going to see the Cubs on May 11th! They are playing the Diamondbacks, who are in first in the NL West, so it should be a good matchup. I plan on taking plenty of pictures and sharing them here.</p>
<p>Did anyone else notice how badly Howry seemed to miss his spot on the home run pitch to Nieves?&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-38"></a>It looked like the catcher was set up low and inside, and the pitch ended up high and outside. The catch by Johnson in the 5th was incredible though. I was just thinking yesterday about how many games I have watched this year without seeing a play like that.</p>
<p>I was noticing on Sports Center how when they show someone being ejected from a game by an ump, they mention a "fantasy ump league." I always thought they were joking, but there is a guy on the web who keeps track of the fantasy umpire standings.&nbsp; Here is the link: <a href="http://baseballumpire.blogspot.com/">Umpire Fantasy League</a>.&nbsp; If you scroll down, you can see the standings.&nbsp; I'm going to go with Tim McClelland as my fantasy umpire, based soley on his morose mugshot on MLB.com's umpire bio site.&nbsp; Add a comment with your pick for the Umpire Fantasy League.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the only ejection we've seen in a Cubs game was Phillies manager Charlie Manuel getting tossed when DeRosa hit that borderline foul homer against the Phillies. I hope Lou pads an ump's stats sometime soon.</p>
