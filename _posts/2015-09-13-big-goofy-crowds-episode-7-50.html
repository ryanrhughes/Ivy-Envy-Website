<p>On this episode, we talk about the somewhat disappointing series split (2-2) in Philadelphia.  After taking the first two games (Friday's double-header), the Cubs dropped both weekend games.  Key pieces of the bullpen did not look sharp and that raises some concerns as the Cubs position themselves for the post-season.  </p>
<p>Speaking of the post-season, the Cubs playoff odds are very near 100%, but there's still some minor details up in the air and we discuss those things.  </p>
<p>We answer several listener questions, share a scary stat and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
