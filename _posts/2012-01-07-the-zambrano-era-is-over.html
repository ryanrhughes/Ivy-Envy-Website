<p><a href="/uploads/2012/01/dm_120105_Big_Z_Traded.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6568" title="Carlos Zambrano" src="/uploads/2012/01/dm_120105_Big_Z_Traded-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>Shortly after Carlos Zambrano walked off the mound after being ejected &nbsp;in Atlanta on August 12th, we predicted that he would never wear a Cubs uniform again, and would probably end up with Ozzie Guillen and the Marlins. &nbsp;Keep in mind, Guillen was still managing the White Sox at the time. &nbsp;This is precisely how things turned out, and now the 2012 Marlins season went from "That will be interesting to watch" to "Oh, I've GOT to see how this turns out."</p>
<p>Cubs fans' opinions on Zambrano are across the board. &nbsp;I have partially defended Zambrano. &nbsp;I have viewed Big Z as the guy that is so passionate about winning that he loses control and simply can't handle not winning. &nbsp;Of course, most of Zambrano's actions have not been worthy of defending.</p>
<p>I could lay out a laundry list of the Zambrano highs and lows with the Cubs, but I won't. &nbsp;His departure from the organization potentially leaves Kerry Wood as the only remaining player from the 2003 team. &nbsp;I will miss Zambrano's fired-up performances and I will miss watching him at the plate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>From the player reactions, the Cubs players won't miss him, and that's probably the most important aspect. If Zambrano had a desire to win and spread it to his teammates in a positive way, I'm guessing some of his minor shenanigans could be overlooked. &nbsp;Everything I have seen over the last five months indicates that he was not a positive clubhouse presence that motivated or brought out the best in his teammates.</p>

<p>Trading Zambrano to the Marlins probably had a huge impact on the clubhouse. &nbsp;A healthy clubhouse is something that, from everything you hear, the Cubs have not had in years. &nbsp;This might be one of the most immediate and welcome changes that the new front office is bringing to the North Side.</p>
