<p>Allow me to introduce you to the Smokies' team leaders in home runs, average, runs batted in, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage. &nbsp;Oh wait, it's just one guy--Rebel Ridling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/08/rebel-ridling.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6178" title="rebel ridling" src="/uploads/2011/08/rebel-ridling.png" alt="" width="90" height="135" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hey ladies--free samples of me!</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I searched for some information regarding the origin of his name but was unable to find anything. &nbsp;One can only assume that his parents were big fans of alliteration and poetic devices in general. &nbsp;Anyway, the Smokies' 1st baseman is having a boatload of success at the plate lately. &nbsp;Ridling won the Southern League's coveted "Hitter of the Week" award for his exploits at the plate. &nbsp;This past week he hit .520 and had 11 RBI. &nbsp;For the season, Ridling is hitting .311 with 20 HR and 78 RBI.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So what's the deal with our buddy Rebel? &nbsp;Does he have any chance of playing for the Cubs any time soon? &nbsp;I'd like to think so. &nbsp;Ridling was drafted in the 25th round of the 2008 First-Year Player Draft. &nbsp;Apparently he struggled a little early on, but after making some adjustments to his swing mechanics, he began to have plenty of success. &nbsp;He hits for power, and he has a decent on-base percentage to go along with that. &nbsp;Ridling's stats have my attention. &nbsp;Hopefully he will continue his ascent to the Cubs. &nbsp;It looks like the Cubs will try to re-sign Pe&ntilde;a for next year, but if Ridling continues to play like he has, it will be hard to deny him an opportunity in Iowa and eventually for the Cubs.</p></p>
