excerpt: 'Matt Murton is back in the Cubs dugout for today''s game.&nbsp; Eric Patterson
  was sent back down to Triple A Iowa.&nbsp; I though Murton seemed like a more logical
  choice when Soriano went down.&nbsp; He doesn''t have an extra base hit on the year,
  yet.&nbsp; But he is a career .300 hitter and is batting .317 this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; '

  content: The cubbies wouldn't have a center field problem if they would have kept  and
    developed Corey in the first place.  I'm still a corey patterson fan, and feel
    it was a big waste, and indicative of the perils of the cub farm system.

    The Cubs farm system is definitely not known for developing raw talent.  However, Patterson is batting a mere .183 right now.  I'm afraid that Pie will meet a similar fate.  The expectations on some of these guys coming up through the system are unrealistic compared to their actual talent.  Factor in the poor development and you have the perfect storm.

    The case could be made that with the right development, Patterson could have become a decent ball player.  But I haven't seen much as far as talent from him.  He has a .183 batting average, but only 9 RBI with 4 HR in 19 games.  Sounds like Dusty's kind of guy at the plate.

<p>Matt Murton is back in the Cubs dugout for today's game.&nbsp; Eric Patterson was sent back down to Triple A Iowa.&nbsp; I though Murton seemed like a more logical choice when Soriano went down.&nbsp; He doesn't have an extra base hit on the year, yet.&nbsp; But he is a career .300 hitter and is batting .317 this year.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-23"></a></p>
<p>I have little confidence in E-Pat.&nbsp; Perhaps it's his last name.&nbsp; It just bring back horrible memories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's refreshing to see that red hair in the dugout, even if it is for a short stint.&nbsp; It was also pretty refreshing to see the Cubs get a win from a left-hander yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
