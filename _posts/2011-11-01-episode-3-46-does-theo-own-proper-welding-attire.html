<p>Andy and Corey comment on the Epstein/Hoyer/McLeod press conference and Hoyer's interview with Dave Kaplan.  These were not hollow media events, but actually had some valuable information in them.  We talk about what we liked most about what was said.</p>
<p>We discuss a few of the issues that the front office will face, such as Mike Quade and Carlos Zambrano.  We also reflect on one situation which they have seemingly made a decision on already - Aramis Ramirez.  </p>
<p>We also have a major announcement to make that will destroy our Cubs blogging competitors.  </p>
