  content: I agree with you, and think it's a good move for the Cubs. I've also just
    read that he has wanted to be a Cub all along, so it will be refreshing to have
    a CF that actually WANTS to play for the team!

  content: "Reed Johnson sure wants to play for this team.  \r\nAll we can do is just
    be optimistic about Byrd.  I really hope that Cubs fans don't play unrealistic
    expectations on a player.  That's what happens when you sign players after career
    years.  Fans expect just a little bit more, when realistically they should expect
    less."

  content: I don't see Reed coming back.  Look for a fourth OF with a little more
    pop.  I think Dye or Nady will fit the bill.  Sam Fuld will be on the roster.  That
    would allow a pickup of a defensive liability like Dye.

  content: Yeah, I don't think Reed will be back.  You don't have much of a chance
    if the players have to display their support for you like Ted Lilly did for Reed.

<p>The Cubs are ringing in the new year with their biggest move of the off-season.&nbsp; They signed Marlon Byrd for 3 years and $15 million.&nbsp; I know very little about Byrd, but I do know that although he is 32 years old, he has really blossomed in the last three years with Texas.&nbsp; I wonder if Rudy Jaramillo might have pushed for this.&nbsp; With the Rangers, Byrd has a .295 batting average and in 2009, he had a career year with 20 HR and 89 RBI.&nbsp; We know how it usually works out signing players after a career year, but this is not a huge financial risk.</p>
<p>When looking at the 2010 Cubs outfield, it pleases me that Milton Bradley is not in the picture and Kosuke Fukudome is back in Right Field.&nbsp; I do find it pretty humorous that on BaseballReference.com, the most similar batter to Byrd is Reed Johnson.</p>
<p>I would like to see Marlon Byrd put the hurt on the Cardinals a few times this season.</p>
