<p>Tonight is the night.&nbsp; The Ivy Envy guys will be at Twenty Sports Grille tonight to watch the Cubs vs. Nationals game and we will record a podcast while we're down there.&nbsp; This season has been painful and you deserve the opportunity to drink your sorrows away with other Cubs fans.&nbsp; For those of you that are feeling a little more hostile and angry, we'll have an outlet for you, as well.</p>
<p>The game starts at 7pm and we will start recording the podcast somewhere around 8pm.&nbsp; We'd love to see you down there.</p>
<p>Twenty is located at 1405 5th Avenue in Moline, Illinois.</p>
