<p>This is our first attempt at a live broadcast. &nbsp;We open up the phone lines and take your calls on Zambrano, Quade and the Cubs.&nbsp; Not many shows can say that they got a call from the Jimmy Kimmel show on their first live broadcast.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to everyone for calling in and thanks to Oscar for sharing a pretty incredible Spring Training story.</p>
