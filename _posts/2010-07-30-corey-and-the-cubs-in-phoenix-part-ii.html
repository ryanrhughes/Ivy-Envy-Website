excerpt: "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>***This is Part II of the recap
  of my trip to Phoenix to watch the Cubs play the Diamondbacks.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3017\"
  target=\"_blank\">Check out Part I here</a>.&nbsp; I will do the same mix of
  tweets and photos as I did in the first part.***</strong></em></p>\r\n<p
  style=\"text-align: left;\">I left off with our little ticket mix-up.&nbsp; I went
  to will-call to pick up the tickets for Tuesday's game and later that night, when
  we handed Jeff and Timoree their tickets (they were to meet us at Tuesday's game),
  we discovered the tickets were printed for Monday's game.&nbsp; I had screwed up
  my order in March, but I sorted things out with a ticket agent over the phone immediately
  and it seemed that everything was in order.&nbsp; Apparently something was not in
  order.&nbsp; It was late Monday night and the box office was closed, so I decided
  I would just walk over to Chase Field in the morning when the box offices opened
  to see if we could do anything.&nbsp; I wasn't that worried about getting tickets.&nbsp;
  Monday's paid attendance was 26,250 and the stadium holds 49,000.&nbsp; I was more
  worried that we wouldn't have tickets, but my credit card was billed.</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Up
  @ 6:30am in Phoenix because I'm so excited to see Carlos Silva pitch tonight.Or,
  having kids has destroyed my ability to sleep in.  Tuesday, July 06, 2010 6:41:39
  AM</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>What do you do when you are in the desert and
  can't sleep past 6:30am? Go to the pool. Tuesday, July 06, 2010 6:57:17 AM</blockquote>\r\nYes,
  even with mega-thick hotel curtains, I was unable to sleep past 6:30am.  So I went
  to the pool, where the water was surprisingly cool.  I only spent about 15 minutes
  in the pool because the sun peeked over the other downtown buildings and even though
  it was shortly after 7am, I could feel my pale Irish/Midwestern skin burning.\r\n\r\nThe
  box office opened at 9am and I walked the 5 blocks from the hotel over to Chase
  Field.  The temperature was near 100 degrees, but I walked these 5 blocks without
  my shirt soaking up a drop of sweat.  It's a weird sensation when you are used to
  having swamp-ass when it's 83 degrees because of the humidity.  One thing I quickly
  remembered...carry water.  You are sweating, but it's just evaporating right away.
  \ You get very thirsty in this environment.  Everyone walking around downtown was
  carrying water and some were even carrying gallons of water.  By the way, this was
  our view of the stadium from our hotel.\r\n\r\n<center><a href=\"/uploads/2010/07/IMG00125.jpg\"><img

  are leaving the hotel, Timoree called and informed us that Jeff snagged us some
  good seats for the game.  He knows someone that has season tickets that won't be
  going to the game.  Then Tawny tells me how good these seats actually are.  The
  are 5th row, directly behind home-plate.  He has 4 seats, so we have 10 total (they
  got the ticket confusion worked out at the box office)and the plan is to rotate
  so everyone can sit in the good seats for a while.  Not only are these seats infinitely
  better than the nose-bleed seats I bought, but I've never even sat in seats that
  close for QC River Bandits games, where they probably cost $12.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty
  giddy about the idea of sitting in these seats all day.  But I'm a Cubs fan, so
  I'm waiting for the tickets to fall through for some reason.  We are always prepared
  for the bottom to drop out on us.\r\n\r\nI have already declared that we must eat
  lunch at a place in Mesa called the <a href=\"http://www.eatpizzapit.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Pizza Pit</a>, located on the northwest corner of Dobson and
  Baseline.  My friend Marisol, who lives in the area, informed me of this place about
  6 months ago.  It is a Quad Cities style pizza place, along the lines of Harris,
  Sluggers, Fields of Pizza and so on.&nbsp; Apparently, a few guys from the Quad
  Cities moved to the Valley of the Sun and decided to take a part of the Quad Cities
  with them.&nbsp; They definitely had the style of the pizza perfected.&nbsp; I would
  say that it's closer to Fields of Pizza than Harris or Sluggers, mainly in that
  it wasn't as greasy as those other two.&nbsp; The walls were decorated in photos
  of landmarks the Quad Cities such as Modern Woodmen Park and the bridges that span
  the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n<center><a href=\"/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-183.jpg\"><img

  alt=\"\" width=\"375\" height=\"280\" /></a></center>\r\n\r\nI spoke
  with one of the managers and he told me that they have 10-15 Quad Citians come in

  about 5 pizza boxes hanging on the wall that were covered in writing and one that
  was sitting in the window.&nbsp; Quad Citians were invited to sign the boxes.&nbsp;

<blockquote><p>At Slider's, right next to Chase Field. Door-man told me that the Prez of the Dbacks called and asked them to not play "Go Cubs Go" again.  Tuesday, July 06, 2010</blockquote><br />
Yeah, so we walked into Sliders about 2 hours before game-time to get something to eat and start greasing the wheels.  Sliders is the bar that's right across the little walkway from Chase Field.  The guy checking ID's was wearing a Cubs hat and commented on the number of Cubs fans at the bar already.  He informed us that Derrick Hall (President and CEO of the Diamondbacks) called Sliders the night before to complain that they were playing "Go Cubs Go" and he feels it's disrespectful to the Diamondbacks and their fans.  I suppose I can see where he's coming from, but those Cubs fans are about 75% of your attendance for this series, so I'd accept the fact that your team's play on the field is disrespectful enough and maybe you should focus on that before you worry about the songs that a bar not attached to the stadium plays.  Sliders was just trying to appeal to their customers.  The place was easily 85% Cubs fans.</p>
<p>I don't know if it was just because the Cubs were in town, but Old Style was the special and there was lots of it.  Here's Mrs. Ivy Envy enjoying a few.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Tawny-Old-Style.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3066" title="Chase  Field- Tawny Old Style" src="/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Tawny-Old-Style.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></center></a></p>
<blockquote><p>I won't be tweeting as much from tonight's #Cubs vs #Dbacks game. 6 rows behind homeplate and I don't want to be "that guy".     Tuesday, July 06, 2010 5:58:40 PM</blockquote><br />
Our seats were stellar and the photos will indicate that.&nbsp; As I said, we were in the 5th row, directly behind homeplate.&nbsp; And this is why I didn't want to be tweeting much during the game.  I didn't want to sit there in my Cubs jersey and hat with my phone in my hand the whole night.  I could just hear Dbacks fans across Arizona watching on FSN saying "Look at that guy, he has great seats and he's sitting there texting all night."  Nor did I want to embarrass Cubs fans on WGN/CSN by being just one step up from the dude in a choice seat with the cell phone plastered to his ear, waving at the camera with a shit-eating grin on his face.  Don't get me wrong, I got my time on your television screens, but I tried to make it as low-key as possible.&nbsp; If I walked down a few rows from our seats, there was a stairway that led down to a bar and restrooms.&nbsp; These were for the folks with the pricey seats.&nbsp; So I sent out a few "tweets" informing those following when I would take the walk down the stairs, which would put me in full view of the camera.</p>
<p>These seats were pretty awesome.  I was surprised at how many seats around us were empty.  Most of the people sitting around us were scouts for other teams, so maybe they set aside a number of seats for scouts, in case a large number of them show up.  Here are some photos from our vantage point:</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-185.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3068" title="Lou" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-185-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-195.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3069" title="California Trip 2010 195" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-195-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-199.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3078" title="California Trip 2010 199" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-199-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="377" height="282" /></a></center></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-197.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3079" title="California Trip 2010 197" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-197-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="282" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-205.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3081" title="California Trip 2010 205" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-205-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="281" /></a></p></center></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We were sitting in the middle of all the scouts.&nbsp; It was pretty incredible to watch them graphing, charting and making notes on every pitch.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-209.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3082" title="California Trip 2010 209" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-209-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="282" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This next photo has a pretty good shot of the scoreboard.&nbsp; Being Cubs fans and traditionalists, at first glance, you would roll your eyes at this huge thing.&nbsp; That was my initial reaction.&nbsp; But as the game went on, I really started to appreciate the board and I enjoyed the stats on it quite a bit.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-219.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3083" title="California Trip 2010 219" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-219-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="282" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The left part of the scoreboard has season stats on the batter and what the players line in the scorecard should look like for the game.&nbsp; After a&nbsp; few pitches into the at-bat, the scorecard part switches over to stats about recent streaks, lifetime stats or interesting tidbits of information.&nbsp; The right part of the scoreboard has an inning summary, which is very useful if you're filling out a scorecard and missed an at-bat.&nbsp; Under that, there is a defensive roster and the stolen base stats on the baserunners.&nbsp; And then at the bottom, there is information on the pitcher.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-239.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3084" title="California Trip 2010 239" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-239-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="309" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the scoreboard is very much aimed at those paying attention to statistics and/or keeping a scorecard.&nbsp; But, in the two games, I didn't see anyone filling out a scorecard besides the scouts.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Cubs won the game and the large fellow got the win to improve to 9-2 on the season.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-232.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3085" title="California Trip 2010 232" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-232-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Offensively, this was a fun game to watch.&nbsp; Fukudome hit a homerun, his second in as many days.&nbsp; Starlin Castro hit a triple while Lee, Theriot and Soto hit doubles.&nbsp; What carried the Cubs to victory, however, was Aramis Ramirez and his 2 homeruns and 4 RBI.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-227.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3087" title="California Trip 2010 227" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-227-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="280" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because there was 8 of us and only 4 of the good seats, we rotated between these choice seats and the cheap seats.&nbsp; I may have hogged a good seat for longer than I should have, but I moved up for a few innings.&nbsp; The Diamondbacks began to work their way back into the game, earning two runs off Sean Marshall in the 8th.&nbsp; Lou went to the bullpen and called in Marmol.&nbsp; I had a hunch this move was about to happen, so I moved back down to the good seats.&nbsp; I was giddy as a school-girl to see Marmol's pitching from this angle.&nbsp; I was in the seat DIRECTLY behind homeplate.&nbsp; Just in watching Marmol warm-up, I couldn't believe the movement on his pitches.&nbsp; Once the Diamondback batters stepped up to the plate, it was comical.&nbsp; I was literally laughing at the movement on his pitches.&nbsp; I wasn't the only person giggling.&nbsp; There was a scout sitting behind me that shook his head and laughed when Marmol threw one of his patent sliders.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-261.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3088" title="California Trip 2010 261" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-261-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="285" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It was incredible to watch and I feel very lucky to see them from that angle and that closely.&nbsp; Marmol came in for the 5-out save, registering 5 strikeouts and allowing one hit.&nbsp; It was his 16th save on the season and it dropped his ERA below 2.00.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall, the trip was awesome.&nbsp; These two wins by the Cubs brought my 2010 record to 4-0.&nbsp; The Cubs haven't played well in Phoenix, and there was a base from the Cubs vs. Dbacks 2007 playoffs there to remind me.&nbsp; I was pretty amazed it wasn't behind glass.&nbsp; It was actually just sitting on the ground in one of the souvenir shops.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-265.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3089" title="California Trip 2010 265" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-265-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="278" /></a></center></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But Mrs. Ivy Envy and I would really like to thank Jeff for hooking us up with these incredible seats.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks to Tiffany and Jay for driving and spending some of their vacation days to hang out in Phoenix and watch the Cubs with us.</p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That's what summer is all about.&nbsp; It's about family and it's about baseball.</p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Thanks for reading these lengthy recaps.&nbsp; There is one more on the way.&nbsp; I had purchased tickets for the Cubs vs. Dodgers game on that Sunday.&nbsp; However, during the day on Tuesday, before this game I just recapped, Tawny's mom texted me to let me know that one of my father-in-law's friends had tickets for Friday's game for us.&nbsp; They were the $125 seats.&nbsp; So great seats were just falling from the skies.&nbsp; Given how long it took me to do this recap, I can't really say when I'll get the Dodgers game done, but you'll want to watch for it.&nbsp; If you want a preview, check out the Podcast episodes <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2993" target="_blank">2.18</a> and <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3008" target="_blank">2.19</a>.</p></p>
