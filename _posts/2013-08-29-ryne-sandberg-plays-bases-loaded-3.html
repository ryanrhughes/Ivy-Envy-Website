<p style="text-align: left;">With Ryne Sandberg coming to town as the manager of the Phillies this weekend, what a perfect time to pull out Bases Loaded 3 and play some baseball as my favorite player of all time! &nbsp;I got this game on Ebay for the low, low price of $2.99; I bought it because I really liked the original Bases Loaded, and it had Ryno on the cover. &nbsp;I paid too much. &nbsp;Once you get into the game, Sandberg is nowhere to be found. &nbsp;Here is the menu screen:</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2013/08/photo-8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8578" alt="photo (8)" src="/uploads/2013/08/photo-8-300x268.jpg" width="300" height="268" /></a></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">If he did have an avatar in the game, it would be embarrassing to his legacy because it is impossible not to make errors when trying to play defense in this game. &nbsp; The way fielding is handled is madness. &nbsp;There is no way to find the appropriate fielder in time to make a play because when a ball is hit, the game maintains the behind-the-pitcher point of view. &nbsp;Hitting is also difficult as pitches magically speed up halfway to home plate. &nbsp;If you're looking for a good 8-bit baseball game, I would go for the original Bases Loaded. &nbsp;There is no way "Ryne Sandberg Plays Bases Loaded 3." &nbsp;What is your favorite baseball video game of all time?</p></p>
