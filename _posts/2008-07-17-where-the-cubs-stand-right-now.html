<p>So here we are, halfway through the season.&nbsp; Actually, the Cubs have played 95 games, so they are closer to 60% of the way through the season.&nbsp; They sit 4.5 games ahead of the Cardinals and 5 games ahead of the Brewers.&nbsp; So, at this point, it's a 67 game season and the Cubs are spotted 4.5 games.&nbsp; So what are the odds they take the division?&nbsp; How safe do you feel with that lead?&nbsp; I feel nervously confident.&nbsp; I have a feeling that defines how most Cubs fans feel right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's look past all the history of failure and heartbreak, though.&nbsp; Let's set that all aside and pretend that we root for a normal baseball team.&nbsp; One without jinxes or curses swirling around.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/ps_odds.php">Baseball Prospectus</a>, the Cubs have a 80% chance of winning the division and a 92% chance&nbsp;of going to the playoffs.&nbsp; Am I that negative and pessimistic that 92% concerns me?&nbsp; I mean, the Cubs <a id="more"></a><a id="more-128"></a>have the best line-up in the division and the National League, if not the best lineup in all of baseball.&nbsp; They are practically unbeatable at home...unless Manstrength or I are there.&nbsp; They have no major long term injuries right now.&nbsp; Soriano will be back soon and although I am not a big Soriano fan, I have to admit that the lineup is more potent with him in there.&nbsp; Plus, the Cubs added the second most desired pitcher on the mid-season trading block.&nbsp; There is nothing but blue skies ahead right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 28th 1977, the Cubs beat the Phillies to bring their record to 47-22 and putting them 8.5 games up in the division.&nbsp; After the game, Lou Boudreau said that once a team gets 25 games above .500, the team will never see .500 again in that season.&nbsp; On this date (July 17th)&nbsp;in 1977, the Cubs had a .607 and were 19 games over .500.&nbsp; Right now, the Cubs are at .600 and 19 games over .500.&nbsp; The Cubs ended the 1977 season 81-81 (.500) and 20 games behind the first place Phillies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is one of many reasons that I am nervously confident.&nbsp; Anything can happen and when you cheer for the boys in blue, nothing is guaranteed.&nbsp; I don't expect a major collapse, but the past won't allow me to be truly confident.</p>
