<p>Wednesday night's Peoria Chiefs game was special for a few reasons. &nbsp;Not only did the Chiefs continue their domination of Clinton and improve their season record to 4-0 against the Lumberkings, but they did it in style. &nbsp;Cam Greathouse carried a no-hitter into the 6th inning before giving up a single to Tim Morris. &nbsp;That single ended up being the only Lumberkings hit on the evening. &nbsp;Greathouse pitched the longest outing for the Chiefs this year, going 7 innings and giving up no runs on just the one hit. &nbsp;Greathouse walked three and struck out eight. &nbsp;Yohan Gonzalez came in to pitch the final two innings and he did not give up a hit.</p>
<p>Not only did the Chiefs throw a no-hiter, but they also recorded a triple-play in the game. &nbsp;In the 7th inning, shortstop Elliot Soto fielded a sharp line drive, flipped the ball to Pierre LePage, who threw to Richard Jones at 1st base for a 6-4-3 triple play. &nbsp;The Chiefs won the game 3-0. &nbsp;They not only played well defensively in the game, but every Chief in the starting line-up, except for Arismendy Alcantara got a base hit.</p>
