<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs-300x272.png" alt="Iowa Cubs Logo" width="300" height="272" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9092" /></a>As the big league club fell again last night, their fourth loss in five games, there are more important players to be watching. Now Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo are great, but the AAA team is the one you should be watching. Basically what I'm saying, get to Iowa to watch this team. Like, now.</p>
<p>You get to the ballpark, the beautiful Principal Park, and it is bright sunshine. The starting pitcher (insert Kyle Hendricks, Tsuyoshi Wada, Dallas Beeler, Eric Jokisch, or Chris Rusin, you really can't go wrong with any of the five) warms up on the mound and gets ready for the game. A starting staff that all five pitchers are in the top 23 in ERA in the entire PCL. Kyle Hendricks is a borderline top 10 prospect in the organization. Tsuyoshi Wada is in the top 6 in ERA and the top 5 in WHIP in the PCL and just got added to the 40 man as he could be on his way to Chicago with trades coming. Chris Rusin has spent time in Chicago over the past two years and threw a no hitter this year. Dallas Beeler is also on the 40 man and is getting a spot start in a double header this Saturday. Eric Jokisch is a lefty from Northwestern that has the best SO/BB ratio, 4.00, on the staff this year. Regardless of who starts, you're going to see a well pitched game.</p>
<p>Now the I-Cubs come to the plate. Leading off is Arismendy Alcantara, a switch hitting second baseman/center fielder that has drawn comparisons to Jose Reyes. Alcantara has the highest OPS on the team with anyone over 50 plate appearances and the most steals on the team, with 18. To go with that, he also has the second highest batting average, at .290, on the team with at least 50 plate appearances. Oh, yeah he is a top 6 prospect in the Cubs system. </p>
<p>Batting third is a top five prospect in all of baseball and the Cubs top guy, Javier Baez. After a slow start, Baez has the most home runs, 11, on the team and the second most steals, 14. Also, anytime he steps in the box, it is must see. He can destroy baseballs and it is so fun to watch. After Baez goes deep, hitting fifth is number two pick in last years draft and recent call up, Kris Bryant. </p>
<p>To go along with the&nbsp;<em>Sparkle</em> that is his eyes, Bryant can also crush baseballs. He has 27 home runs combined in Tennessee and Iowa. Bryant is also a top tier baseball prospect and has the highest OPS on the team and he has only played six games. In those six games, he has five hits, all homers. </p>
<p>New on the team, player/coach Manny Ramirez. Yes, that Manny Ramirez. He is helping the younger hitters on the team with their off field decisions and hitting approaches. Adding to that, he will play some outfield and DH for the I-Cubs. There are some other good pieces on the team as well, such as former first round picks Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters.</p>
<p>After the starters are done, the bullpen is loaded. To pitch the seventh and eighth will be top prospects Armando Rivero and Arodys Vizcaino. Both of these pitchers dominated Tennessee and just got called up. To go along with heat, both pitchers have nasty breaking balls that can strike out hitters while making them silly. Rivero and Vizcaino could both make it up to Chicago this fall. To close out the game, the I-Cubs all time saves leader Blake Parker, who has spent time in Chicago this year and last year, will nail it down.</p>
<p>This team is the most loaded team in the minors. It is almost ridiculous how much star power is on this team. Five or six of the top 10 prospects in the Cubs system are on this team now. Oh and we can't forget about one of the greatest right handed hitters of all time is playing the role of player/coach. Who knows how long all these players are going to be in Iowa at the same time. I know one thing, I'm going to Des Moines July 2nd, and I would suggest you make the trip out to Principal Park soon. Very, very soon.</p>
