  content: The Rockies-Phillies series has been fun to watch, but the Twins-Yankees
    series was a big letdown.  I guess I'm pulling for the Rockies and the Angels
    now.

<p>Fans of 24 baseball teams were faced with a decision this week.&nbsp; Who do you root/pull for in the playoffs?&nbsp; I know some fans stop watching when their team's season ends.&nbsp; I know this type of fan.&nbsp; I'm not this type of fan.&nbsp; Going into the playoffs, I told folks (and I mentioned it on the podcast) that I would be pulling for the Cardinals in the NL.&nbsp; I have reasons behind it.&nbsp; The Cardinals are in the NL Central.&nbsp; I would consider that to be "my" division.&nbsp; They are also a smaller-market Midwest team, and as a baseball fan, I have an appreciation for this type of team.&nbsp; They are a step down from the Twins in my book.</p>
<p>I realized that it would be impossible for most Cubs fans to pull for the Cardinals.&nbsp; When the White Sox won the World Series in 2005, I had a list of reasons that I would be pulling for the White Sox.&nbsp; Yet, as the playoffs progressed, I couldn't do it.&nbsp; In the middle of a game, I would find myself cheering when the other team scored.&nbsp; This week, four years later, I realized why it was I could not pull for the White Sox.&nbsp; What kept me from following through is this:&nbsp; Ozzie Guillen is a complete asshat and as a team, the White Sox were not likeable at all.&nbsp; I did not want to see these douchebags succeed.</p>
<p>As the Cardinals are now one game from elimination, I've struggled all week with the idea of whether or not I could root for them.&nbsp; I felt that I should because of the reasons I listed above.&nbsp; But I can't root for them.&nbsp; I can't pull for them.&nbsp; I can't wish them well in the playoffs.&nbsp; They are the NL Central, but there is something larger than that loyalty.&nbsp; It's the fact that if they do well, it gives all the Cardinals fans more ammunition to use against me.&nbsp; Granted, they have all the ammunition they need when it comes to successful baseball in comparison to the Cubs.&nbsp; But they need to experience some of the pain we've endured the last few years.&nbsp; They need to get swept in the first round by the Dodgers.&nbsp; Our offense was non-existent and we were never in the games in the last two playoff appearances.&nbsp; The Cardinals had a game won and the guy that played a large role in getting them to the playoffs took a flyball off his nuts and they lost the game.&nbsp; The heartbreak I saw on the faces of Cardinals fans on Friday morning gave me a great pleasure.</p>
<p>May they lose, and lose painfully.</p>
