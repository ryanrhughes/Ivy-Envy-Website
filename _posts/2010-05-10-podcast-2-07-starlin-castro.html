<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy discuss the recent terrible play by the Cubs, including a series sweep at the hands of the Pirates.  The Cubs reacted by calling up Starlin Castro and we welcome Matt Swain from <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/chicago-cubs-wrigley-bound/" target="_blank">WrigleyBound</a> on to get us up to speed on Castro's minor league performance.  We are also joined by Brian from <a href="www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo's Goggles</a> to discuss the Cubs series with the Reds and the wager between Ivy Envy and Chris Sabo's Goggles.  And, we do the Podcast Question of the Week and read your responses to the question "What Cubs player have you liked/supported when he was hated by a majority of Cubs fans?"</p>
