<p>This last Saturday, we filled a 55 passenger bus and drove to Chicago to see the Cubs host the Rockies.  If you'd like to hear us talk about the bus trip, check out our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7782" target="_blank">Podcast Episode 4.32</a>.  </p>
<p>I have invited anyone on the bus to share their photos with us and our Facebook page.  You can look at all those photos <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151032449608947.419963.298438948946&type=3" target="_blank">here</a>.  If you were on the bus and would like to share your photos, email them to corey@ivyenvy.com.</p>
<p>I see no reason that we will not be doing the <strong>4th Annual Ivy Envy Bus Trip</strong> in 2013.  Stay tuned to our site and Facebook page for information.  I usually book the date in January or February.  </p>
