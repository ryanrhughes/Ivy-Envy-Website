  content: 'Good points across the board, Corey. It''s strange to me that the Cubs
    would rush Samardzija when they don''t need him to fill seats or anything [read:
    Jacksonville Jaguars thinking about Tim Tebow]. But I followed his blog while
    he was in the minors and really like the guy. If he can get that last pitch, I
    agree that he could be a real success. Hope he gets a shot at a starting gig this
    year!'

  content: "While the handling of Samardzija may not have been the best thing for
    him, superior athletes find a way to succeed.  The Twins dorked around with both
    Johan Santana and Francisco Liriano and that didn't prevent them from becoming
    elite pitchers.  Injuries derailed Liriano.\r\n\r\nThe Cubs handled Juan Cruz
    and Carlos Zambrano similarly when they came up.  Zambrano's performances demanded
    that he be given a shot in the rotation despite the bullpen being in a constant
    state of shambles.  Juan Cruz did not shine and was relegated to whatever role
    the Cubs found for him.\r\n\r\nThe Cubs have pretty much outlined what it would
    take for Samardzija to get a shot at the rotation and he hasn't done it.  I'd
    have rather kept Millar than carry him as the 12th pitcher, so I don't feel bad
    for him in the slightest.  He is getting more than his share of opportunities
    because of his contract.  That is all a prospect can ask."

  content: "I see your point, Tim.  But I don't think every player is necessarily
    at the same level of big league readiness at the point of being drafted.  It's
    clear that Samardzija needs to work on his pitches and I don't think the Cubs
    have given him a reasonable amount of time in the minor leagues to develop them.
    \ \r\n\r\nI'd rather have the Cubs keep Millar and send Samardzija to Iowa.  That's
    where he needs to be and I think the Cubs would get the most out of him, in the
    long run, if that's what they did.  \r\n\r\nMy opinion is that he should be in
    Iowa for the whole season.  He could get a full year of coaching from Mike Mason
    and I would hope that Greg Maddux could assist with his development.  \r\n\r\nIf
    that will lead to the best player for the Cubs, pick up a cheap middle reliever
    and send him to Iowa."

<p>Jeff Samardzija has "earned" a spot in the bullpen to start the 2010 campaign for the Cubs.  I had hoped to see Samardzija start in Iowa, and the move to have him up with the Cubs is just another step towards an inevitable ugly ending with Cubs fans.  If you have been reading Ivy Envy for a while, you know that I haven't been happy with the way the Cubs have used Samardzija.   Examples are <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1064">here</a> and <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=795">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since his first year with the Cubs, Samardzija has been called upon to attempt to plug holes in the pitching staff, primarily the bullpen.  He was used as a starter twice in 2009 by the Cubs.  It's been clear from being drafted that Samardzija needs to develop a third and off-speed pitch to become a major league ready and effective pitcher.  But because of the Cubs shallow and shaky bullpen, the front office has called upon Samardzija repeatedly to spend time with the big league club, rather than work on becoming an effective starting pitcher.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most of what I read and hear from Cubs fans is negative towards Samardzija.  Many people state that after 4 years at Notre Dame and 4 years with the Cubs organization, he should be Major League ready.  When the Cubs drafted him, they signed him for five years and $10 million and a $2.5 million signing bonus.  I suspect if the NFL wasn't an option for Samardzija, he wouldn't have been given such a lucrative contract.  I mean, this isn't mega-money, but it's hefty for someone unproven.&nbsp; Of course, it doesn't help to keep fans' expectations grounded when the GM says he projects him to be a "<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2736354" target="_blank">high end starter</a>".&nbsp; So the contract has two more seasons, with a club options for 2012 and 2013.&nbsp; At the end, the contract will be cost the Cubs $16.5 million.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So my question is this:&nbsp; Why don't the Cubs do what's best for Samardzija and ultimately best for the club?&nbsp; Give him adequate time in the minors to develop all the pitches he needs to be successful.&nbsp; If the Cubs are going to invest that much money in a player, why not get as much quality pitching from him that you can?&nbsp; Why settle for 50%-75% of what he is possibly capable of, just to plug a hole in the bullpen?&nbsp; Carlos Zambrano was given 99 games in the minor leagues before he was called up to Chicago.&nbsp; Ted Lilly has pitched 109 games of non-rehab minor league games.&nbsp; Jeff Samardzija has pitched in only 77 games in the minor leagues.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most players are given lengthy stints to work with a consistent coaching staff, but I doubt Samardzija has been able to benefit from in-depth coaching because in his four seasons, he's been on six different teams within the Cubs organization.&nbsp; The most games he has spent in one place was his 26 games with the Cubs in 2008 (posting a 2.28 ERA, by the way).&nbsp; His longest stretch with a minor league team was just 24 games with High-A Daytona in 2007.&nbsp; So he hasn't had that consistent coaching that you would count on to develop a young prospect into a good pitcher.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But 2010 appears to be another season in which the bullpen is shallow and most likely, unstable.&nbsp; So I have a whole season of increasing Jeff Samardzija hating and Notre Dame jokes.&nbsp; All I see is the Cubs ruining another prospect.</p></p>
