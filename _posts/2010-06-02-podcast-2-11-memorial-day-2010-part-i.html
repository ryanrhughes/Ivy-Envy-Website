<p style="text-align: left;">Andy, Corey and Ryan welcome guests Patrick and Ian for this year's drunk episode(s).&nbsp; Andy and Corey talk about their first game in the bleachers at Wrigley.&nbsp; We apologize for these episodes.&nbsp; We are aware that it's ridiculous, but I'm sure you've been in this condition and sounded as unintelligent and jack-assish before, too.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Stay tuned for Part II in which Tim returns to the podcast from the military.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Last year's Drunk Episode is #11.&nbsp; It's fun to listen to because you sometimes forget how much you hated Kevin Gregg.</p></p>
