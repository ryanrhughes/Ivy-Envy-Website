<p>This was a huge week in the world of Cubs podcasting.&nbsp; Cubscast released their last episode a few days ago.&nbsp; After 6 years and an incredible 657 episodes, Lou and Sheps were effectively shut down by "The Man", or Major League Baseball.&nbsp; I won't get into the details of what happened.&nbsp; Listen to the <a href="http://www.cubscast.com/podcasts/cubscast657.mp3">final episode</a> to get the full story straight from the source.</p>
<p>The dedication these guys had for their product and listeners is unparalleled.&nbsp; I can't fathom what it would be like to prepare for, record and produce 3 episodes a week for 6 years.&nbsp; Their families and wives have shown the same amount of dedication to loan these guys to Cubs fans for over 300 hours of recording, on top of the preparation time for all these episodes.</p>
<p>So, this clearly leaves a hole in Cubs podcasting that can never be filled.&nbsp; Podcasting is a time consuming endeavor, which is why they seem to come and go, disappear and re-appear.&nbsp; I didn't listen to Cubscast during the season because I was afraid I would repeat something they said, and then not give them their due credit.&nbsp; However, I faithfully downloaded Cubscast during the off-season.&nbsp; It was nice to hear what was going on with the Cubs in a nice little audio package when I was suffering from the annual disappointment hangover that left me little desire to spend time reading articles or blogs about the Cubs.</p>
<p>Up to this point, the Ivy Envy Podcast has been a round-table format with anywhere from 2 to 6 writers from our site. &nbsp; We have taken the months of October through February off.&nbsp; But with the departure of Cubscast, we have decided to change things a bit.&nbsp; We will be returning this week and we will release episodes once a week.&nbsp; These won't be our regular round-table discussions.&nbsp; Andy, Kurt and myself will be the hosts of these shorter and (hopefully) more focused episodes.</p>
<p>In no way do we see ourselves as a replacement for Cubscast, but I know there has to be a lot of Cubs fans out there that liked hearing fans talk about the team they love.&nbsp; But more importantly, we'd like to give Cubs fans the opportunity to vent and celebrate (but obviously, mainly vent) about the boys in blue.&nbsp; So share our podcast with other Cubs fans.&nbsp; Send in e-mails and leave comments.&nbsp; We all know what this Cubs blog/podcast community really is - a support group.</p>
<p>So Lou and Sheps, thank you for your six years and 657 episodes of service.&nbsp; I hope you re-appear at some point in the future to share your talents with Cubs fans.</p>
