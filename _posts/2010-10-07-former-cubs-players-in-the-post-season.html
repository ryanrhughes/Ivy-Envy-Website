    the Phillies and the New York Yankees.  It has everything that would make it standard:
    \ New York has plenty of money, and the Phillies are from a hard luck town.  They're
    good, but they aren't quite the Yankees and they probably never will be.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Unless you are a very new to following the Cubs, you are probably used to not seeing the boys in blue playing in the post-season.&nbsp; However, the rosters for the teams in the playoffs are typically riddled with ex-Cubs players.&nbsp; There aren't that many out there this year.</p>
<p>The Yankees have the largest number of former Cubs on their roster.&nbsp; They also have a manager that many Cubs fans would like to see wearing a different shade of pinstripes.&nbsp; <strong>Kerry Wood</strong> has played very well for the Yankees since he headed to New York after being traded by the Indians.&nbsp; With Cleveland, he had a 6.30 ERA in 23 games.&nbsp; He has pitched in 24 games for the Yankees and posted a 0.69 ERA in the regular season.&nbsp; Opponents are only hitting .161 off Kerry since his move.&nbsp; <strong>Sergio Mitre</strong> is also playing for the Yankees.&nbsp; He was in Chicago from 2003-2005 and went 4-9 with the Cubs.</p>
<p><strong>Andres Blanco</strong> is playing 2nd base for the Rangers.&nbsp; The only thing Cubs fans should remember about Blanco is that he wore #13 right before Starlin Castro.</p>
<p>2010 was an odd year for the Cubs and in August, we saw the most steady player of the decade for the Cubs in <strong>Derrek Lee</strong> traded to Atlanta.&nbsp; All Cubs fans were disappointed in Lee's production this year and it has increased a little for the Braves.&nbsp; He batted .251 for the Cubs and in the last month and a half of the season, he batted .287 for the Braves.&nbsp; He also raised his OPS nearly 100 points from .751 to .849.&nbsp; Oh yeah, <strong>Kyle Farnsworth</strong> is on the Braves, too.</p>
<p>Another player that many Cubs fans liked that was traded away in 2010 is <strong>Mike Fontenot</strong>, who is playing with San Francisco.&nbsp; In 28 games for the Giants, Little Babe Ruth has batted .282 with 0 HR and 5 RBI's.&nbsp; 2010 may cause Fontenot to lose the nickname, though.&nbsp; He hit 1 homerun in the regular season.&nbsp; It was his lowest output since coming up to the Majors in 2007.&nbsp; His highest homerun totals?&nbsp; He hit 9 homeruns in both 2008 and 2009 for the Cubs.</p>
<p>Cincinnati and Philadelphia don't have any ex-Cubs on their rosters, which makes them even easier to hate.&nbsp; Tampa Bay and Minnesota don't either, and that's not surprising considering how those organizations are constructed.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to know about these 2010 playoffs though, is that if you want to continue listening to Bob Brenly's analysis, you'll have to suffer through Dick Stockton's play-by-play announcing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Stockton will be doing the Division Series that interests me the most, the Braves vs. the Giants.&nbsp; I'll be pulling for the Twins and the Giants in the playoffs, which means it will be the Yankees vs. the Phillies.</p>
