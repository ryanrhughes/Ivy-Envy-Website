<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Arismendy_Alcantara.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Arismendy_Alcantara-300x168.jpg" alt="Arismendy_Alcantara" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9822" /></a>When talking Cubs position prospects, the players that are usually discussed are Javier Baez, Kris Bryant, Jorge Soler, and Albert Almora. There is one guy that has flown under the radar to many of the casual fans, and that player is Arismendy Alcantara.</p>
<p>Alcantara is 22 years old and currently the starting second baseman for the Iowa Cubs in AAA. He is hitting .271 on the year in only 70 at bats spread out through 19 games. To go with that batting average, the switching hitting middle infielder has a .284 OBP and a .514 slugging. That is good for a .798 OPS as he is making a push for a mid season call up.</p>
<p>A not well known name coming into 2013, Alcantara made his mark on the season. With AA Tennessee, he hit .271 with a .804 OPS while stealing 31 bases and hitting 15 home runs. Also a bright spot for the #6 ranked prospect in the Cubs organization by Baseball Prospectus, started for the World Team in the Futures Game and went 1-3 while hitting a home run into the second deck of the Citi Field bleachers off of Red Sox prospect, Anthony Ranaudo. The second baseman only played five innings, but impressed the scouts that were in attendance.</p>
<p>One of these scouts, Jason Parks, made an interesting comparison to a Jose Reyes like player. A switching hitting middle infielder that is a 20/20 threat that can also hit .280 in the big leagues. I can get on board with a Reyes like talent at the top of the lineup getting on base for Baez and Bryant.</p>
<p>A shortstop coming through the ranks, Alcantara has played second base for just over a year. Starting last year in Tennessee, a young shortstop by the name of Javier Baez met him midway through last year, causing Alcantara to move to second. In 15 less chances at second last year, the 83rd ranked prospect in baseball according to Baseball Prospectus, made 17 less errors than at shortstop.</p>
<p>Alcantara is a prospect that is often overlooked because of the Big 4, but he can prove to be a big asset to the big league club before those four guys. If Alcantara can continue to hit .270 - .280, you will certainly see him see him in the big leagues as a September call up and possibly the starting second baseman for the 2015 Chicago Cubs. And hopefully the starting second baseman for many years to come.</p>
