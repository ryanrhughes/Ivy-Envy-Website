<p>As I laid in bed last night, satisfied with the Cubs extra-inning win and delighted with the fact that Soriano slapped a base hit, I created the following scenerio in&nbsp;the form of a&nbsp;lucid dream:</p>
<p>I imagined pausing the world after Fontenot touched homeplate to win the game.&nbsp; Soriano and I <a id="more"></a><a id="more-88"></a>are the only people not frozen.&nbsp; I say to him, "Alfonso, I will give you the opportunity to rewind this last play.&nbsp; We will take away your "I tried to swing defensively and foul the ball off, but somehow it ended up fair and I won the game for my team" play and perhaps, temporarily, the Cub win.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will stand at the plate with the count 2-2 again.&nbsp; This will give you another opportunity to swing for the fences and win the game with a homerun."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see Soriano taking that deal.&nbsp; I don't think he planned at all to win that game with a base hit from a defensive swing.&nbsp; It's not his style.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, back to reality.&nbsp; I can't understand why the Dodgers didn't walk Soriano.&nbsp; Yes, he's a free swinger and he may strike out.&nbsp; But you don't throw him hittable pitches!&nbsp; I suppose the Dodgers were in a bad spot.&nbsp; He may have been an easier out than Theriot, Lee and Ramirez.&nbsp; But with one out, I think you have to walk him to set up a double play.&nbsp; I'll take it though.&nbsp; It's nice to see them win three close games in a series.</p>
