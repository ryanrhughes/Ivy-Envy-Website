<p>Tonight's Cubs vs. Yankees game in New York has been postponed because of rain. &nbsp;The game will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader tomorrow. &nbsp;It's probably nice for the players that the game was called early, essentially giving them another day off. &nbsp;Without any other weather interferences, the Cubs will basically have a total of 3 days off this week.</p>
<p>Since you won't be watching the Cubs tonight, if you haven't watched this interview that Dan Patrick did with Jeff Samardzija, it's an interesting one. &nbsp;Samardzija talks about doctoring baseballs, the impact of the party atmosphere in Wrigleyville on players and his future with the Cubs.</p>
