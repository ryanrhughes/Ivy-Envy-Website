<p>Andy and Corey discuss the three games of Spring Training that we've heard, but not seen.  We consider the reasons that Soriano sees himself someone that leads by example and how the rest of us see him.  While there aren't many position battles this year in Mesa, we briefly discuss Blake DeWitt and his attempt to earn a spot on the team.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are hitting the ball well and neither of us have much hope that it's a sign the team will be an offensive powerhouse this year.  Brett Jackson has been a source of offensive production between the intrasquad games and the first few Spring Training games.  We both look forward to the televised Spring Training games, so we can see Brett Jackson and Anthony Rizzo in action. </p>
<p>We do a segment with Joe Martin, who is covering the action in Mesa for us.  Joe talks about the promising things he saw at the game on Sunday.  He went to Fitch Park today to watch the minor league camp and witnessed a quite interesting training session that at least one player took very seriously.  </p>
