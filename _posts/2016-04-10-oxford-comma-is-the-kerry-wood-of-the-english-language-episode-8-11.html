<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 389<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast. Unfortunately, parts of this episode have a more somber tone than our previous few episodes.  Kyle Schwarber is out for the 2016 season and on this episode, we discuss the injury. </p>
<p>How did it happen? What will Schwarber's recovery look like? How do other athletes recover from this injury/surgery? What might a 2017 Kyle Schwarber look like on the field? Will he play catcher? Can he play outfield? Do the Cubs need to trade him to an AL team so he can be a designated hitter? What does this mean for Schwarber's service time/free agency date? What will the 2016 Cubs be without Schwarber? Who will play left field?  We (attempt to) answer all of these questions on this episode. </p>
<p>We check in on Baez's progress at extended Spring Training. Oh yeah...there's baseball games (and Cubs wins) to talk about. We share a few thoughts from the Cubs series with Arizona.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
