<p>With a Cubs line-up that doesn't exactly scream "playoff caliber", or even "competitive baseball" or "entertaining in the least bit", fans are eager to see the future and perhaps spark this team that currently has a seven-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Before the acquisition of Anthony Rizzo, the main source of hope in the minor league system was Brett Jackson. It's a good thing the microscope isn't completely on Jackson. He is hitting just .228 with a .324 OBP for Iowa this year. The good news is that over half of Jackson's hits have been extra-base hits. Jackson played 8 more games at the AAA level than he has played this year, and is batting almost seventy points lower.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Anthony Rizzo is destroying Pacific Coast League pitching. He's batting .344 with a league-leading 14 home runs. He also currently has a 1.095 OPS. The only players in MLB history with higher career OPS numbers are Babe Ruth and Ted Williams. Now, Anthony Rizzo is not Babe Ruth or Ted Williams, and many players have had higher OPS numbers in single seasons, but that gives you an idea of how badly Rizzo is crushing the ball.</p>
<p>While Rizzo struggled when he was called up to the majors last year by the Padres, all signs indicate that he is ready to play with the Cubs. Of course, first-base is currently occupied by Bryan LaHair, who is batting .315 and leading the team in home runs. LaHair is proving his spot on the big league roster.</p>
<p>I have been a proponent of leaving Rizzo in Iowa. Given his struggles against major league pitching in 2011, I believed it made sense to leave him down and continue to develop, especially because he is only 22 years old. My opinion is changing, though. Besides LaHair, power has been nearly non-existent for this Cubs team. The Cubs are 15-27. By the end of the day, they could own the worst record in baseball.</p>
<p>This team needs a spark. Perhaps right now would be the least-intense time to bring Rizzo up in regards to pressure. The team is playing bad baseball. If Rizzo comes up and struggles, it's just more of the same. If Rizzo can come up and continue what he's doing in Iowa, it might give the team and the fan-base the spark that the owners of this franchise need. Empty seats in April/May are one thing. Empty seats in June/July are another.</p>
<p>The rumors are that Rizzo could come up when the Cubs enter inter-league play the first full week of June with two series (Twins and White Sox) in American League ballparks with the Designated Hitter. That would allow the Cubs to play both LaHair and Rizzo. Two series at Wrigley in that stretch would give Sveum and the Cubs the opportunity to play with the defense to determine if there is room for Rizzo and LaHair on this roster.</p>
<p>There are lots of options to fit Rizzo on this club and if they do indeed bring him up for this inter-league play and he performs well, we can probably expect to see some more changes. I don't think many Cubs fans are scared of change these days, so give Rizzo a shot.</p>
