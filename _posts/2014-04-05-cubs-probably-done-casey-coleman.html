<p>After being drafted in the 15th round and spending six seasons in the Cubs system, it appears the Cubs are done with RHP Casey Coleman.<br />

<p>A third-generation MLB player, Coleman pitched 48 games with the Cubs between 2010 and 2012 with a 7-13 record and 5.76 ERA. Coleman was entering his fourth season at the AAA level and the move made room on the Iowa roster for Alberto Cabrera. &nbsp;This move isn't completely surprising considering the Cubs have some decent arms in Iowa now, and more on the way. &nbsp;There's not really room for a guy that seems stuck at the AAA level.</p>
