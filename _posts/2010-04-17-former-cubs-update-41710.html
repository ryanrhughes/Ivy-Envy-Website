<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matt Murton</span></strong></p><br />
A few months ago, I noticed that Matt Murton was playing in Japan. He's playing outfield for the Hanshin Tigers in the Central League of Nippon Professional Baseball.&nbsp; The Rockies sold Murton&rsquo;s rights to the Japanese team in December. &nbsp;Murton would have been arbitration-eligible after batting .324/.389/.499 in Triple A in 2009.&nbsp; He did spend 29 games with the Rockies last year, but the Rockies outfield was fairly crowded and there just wasn&rsquo;t space for him in the future.&nbsp; Murton signed with the Tigers for 2 years and 100 million yen, with a 50 million yen signing bonus.&nbsp; As best as I can tell, that&rsquo;s about $1 million USD with a $500,000 signing bonus.&nbsp; The second year of the contract is a club option, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason that they wouldn&rsquo;t pick it up, given his current production.</p>
<p>The Tigers are about three weeks into their season, and I thought this would be a good opportunity to check on Matt's progress.</p>
<p>Through yesterday, the Tigers are 9-8.&nbsp; Murton is serving as their leadoff hitter and seems to have settled into Japanese baseball.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s look at some of his stats.</p>
<p>Murton is leading the Tigers in many offensive categories (.377/.442/.594)&nbsp; He is in the top 10 in these categories for the Central League leaders.&nbsp; Murton is the only Tiger with a stolen base, and he&rsquo;s stolen four.&nbsp; He started the season by reaching base in 15 straight games.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reed Johnson</span></strong></p><br />
After earning $3 million in 2009 with the Cubs, the Riverside, CA native Johnson signed a one-year deal with the Dodgers in February for $800,000 and another $250,000 in incentives that are based on games played and plate appearances.</p>
<p>Reed has appeared in 8 of the Dodgers&rsquo; 10 games in 2010 as the fourth outfielder.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s spent time in the corner outfield positions.&nbsp; He is batting .333 (6-18) with a double, a triple and an RBI in the young season. I&rsquo;m curious if Dodgers fans appreciate Reed&rsquo;s hustle and gritty play.&nbsp; I may be biased because I don&rsquo;t like the Dodgers and I really like Reed Johnson, but from the photos I&rsquo;ve seen, he just doesn&rsquo;t look like he fits in:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Milton Bradley</span></strong></p><br />
Oh, where to start with the self proclaimed &ldquo;Kanye West and Ron Artest of baseball&rdquo;?&nbsp; Things did not start well for Bradley this season.&nbsp; He went 1-22 in the first seven games of the season.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s usually not his play on the field that places Bradley in the headlines though, and that has not changed.&nbsp; He has flipped off fans in Texas, blown kisses to fans in Oakland and shattered a bat after striking out.</p>

<p>Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu had a sit-down with Milton this last Monday and the team decided they needed to take an effort to <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/dailypitch/post/2010/04/mariners-shower-milton-bradley-with-love/1" target="_blank">show Bradley their appreciation</a> for him carrying the team to a 3-0 win on Tuesday and doused him with beer.&nbsp; Though Bradley is not hitting the cover off the ball, he has had some timely hitting in the last few games and he&rsquo;s raised his batting average to .147.</p>
<p>We know how Bradley works though.&nbsp; The highs and lows will surely provide us Cubs fans entertainment this season, especially if Carlos Silva continues to pitch like he has in his first few starts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />
Aaron Miles</span></strong></p><br />
The Cubs traded Aaron Miles and Jake Fox to the Oakland A&rsquo;s in December for Jeff Gray, Ronny Morla and Matt Spencer.&nbsp; Less than a month later, Miles was traded to the Reds in the off-season by the A&rsquo;s for Willy Tavaras and Adam Rosales.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t take long for the Reds to identify that Miles is an awful player and he was released on the first day of the 2010 season.</p>
