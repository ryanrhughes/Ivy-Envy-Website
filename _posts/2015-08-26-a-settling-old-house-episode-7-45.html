We have more wins to talk about and we look back on the month of August and share some stats that have contributed to this 21-4 run.  The offense has been spectacular and the pitching has kept them in games.  </p>
<p>We spend a fair amount of time swooning over this team, then move on to the recent injuries to Soler and Motte.  We also talk about some additions to the team, mainly in the form of speed.  We answer listener questions and include some listener voicemail about where the callers would like to see the Cubs play a wild-card game.  </p>
