  content: Well said. I loved Theriot when he was with the Cubs. I still like him
    and view him as a average player (2nd baseman). What I think really hurt him was
    in 2008 he hit .307 which was by far a career year for him. In 09 we expected
    the same and when it didnt happen we considered as a "off year". But this year
    we all realized that The Riot wasnt a .307 hitter that and a combination of not
    making the post season had make alot of people sick of everyone on the field.
    Wait and see the first 2 months if Fukodome doesn't produce...

  content: "Yeah, I was going to draw a parallel to Fukudome in the post, but I figured
    the post was long enough.  The only difference is that Theriot's contract was
    nowhere near Fukudome's 14.5 million.  \r\n\r\nBut that's a sign of Hendry's incompetence
    more than anything.  Hendry (and Cubs fans) bought into the hype of Fukudome.
    \ Hendry drastically overpaid for a good, not great player.  Personally, I like
    Fukudome.  I like him in the field and he actually had a decent batting average
    and OPS when he wasn't batting leadoff."

  content: "What we all bought into was the hype of Diaske Matsuzaka. Boston started
    a revolution of paying way too much for a guy from the far east that has this
    amazing mystical magic. I like Fukodome as well I just dont like how much we pay
    for him. But that is par for the course. What we all found out is that Hendry
    has overpaid for:\r\nA good not great Fukodome\r\nAn aging non defensive man in
    the NL Alfonso Soriano\r\nA lunatic sometimes ace Carlos Zambrano\r\nA bat shit
    crazy outfielder Milton Bradley\r\n\r\nIt makes me absolutely sick to my stomach
    to think we could have had someone like Bobby Abreu for that past three year for
    the same cost as one year of Fukodome and Bradley.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to be
    a angry Cubs fan. I appreciate Hendry essentially put his job on the line and
    \"going for it\" to try and win us a world series. It just makes me sad that it
    didn't work out and doesn't look like it will for a couple more years."

  content: "Neels, \r\n\r\nIt may have started even earlier than that, and justifiably
    so:  With Ichiro Suzuki.  This cause a HUGE demand for players in the Far East
    that had what we at first considered to be great potential, but then found to
    be a lot of exponential hype.  \r\n\r\nI don't even want to think about how we
    could have had Bobby Abreu.  It maikes me want to vomit just thinking about it.
    \ \r\n\r\nSpaeking of Ichiro, does anybody else think that it's a little weird
    the Yankees never really went after him?\r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "I dont think that it is fair to compare anyone with Suzuki. I firmly believe
    that he is the best player I have ever seen. BAR NONE! He is a modern day Ty Cobb.
    \r\nI think everyone is at fault for not jumping on that. The M's only post 13
    million and he signed his first contract for 3 years 14 million. \r\nThat is a
    total of $27 million for 3 years"

  content: "You're probably right about not comparing him to anyone, but I still think
    that's where all of this began.\r\n\r\nIchiro Suzuki is incredible and it's hard
    to believe that they got him at that price, even back then. \r\n\r\nI don't know
    about the best player ever, but as far as playing the game the way it's supposed
    to be played, it's very close.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p><a href="/uploads/2010/12/cubs-lose-to-diamondbacks-10-6-07.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3473" title="Ryan Theriot" src="/uploads/2010/12/cubs-lose-to-diamondbacks-10-6-07.jpg" alt="" width="373" height="230" /></a></p>
<p>Ryan Theriot worked his way back into the National League Central, as well as the minds of Cubs fans on Tuesday when he was traded from the Dodgers to the Cardinals.&nbsp; The reactions from Cubs fans was a little surprising to me.&nbsp; Twitter was filled with jokes that mocked Theriot immediately, and that only increased after some of Theriot's comments about the trade.</p>
<p>It was only a few years ago that Theriot was a fan favorite of many fans in Wrigley.&nbsp; Around Wrigley, jerseys with the #2 on the back were pretty common.&nbsp; Many fans lovingly referred to him as "The Riot."&nbsp; But most of this love faded as fans became disgusted with the team as a whole in 2009 and 2010, and Theriot wasn't immune to it.&nbsp; His image with fans and the Cubs was probably damaged a little when he took the Cubs to arbitration.</p>
<p>Theriot was drafted by the Cubs and came up through the Cubs system.&nbsp; Because Theriot was homegrown, it was easy to assume he was young and had room for improvement.&nbsp; However, in his first full season with the major league team in 2007, he was in his 7th year with the organization.&nbsp; Theriot turns 31 next week.&nbsp; His mistakes were not from inexperience, and his skills were not going to improve.&nbsp; Apparently, the overall poor play from the Cubs in 2009 and 2010 brought the real Theriot to light.</p>
<p>There are things that Theriot was good at.&nbsp; The man could slap a single down the first base line.&nbsp; I remember many rallies in 2008 that Theriot started with that poke.&nbsp; That is about the extent of his value.&nbsp; Theriot was frustrating to watch at shortstop.&nbsp; He had poor range and looked frantic and confused.&nbsp; He was even more frustrating on the basepaths.&nbsp; He seemed to have no instinct, and while it was not the case, it seemed like about one inning a game was ended by Theriot getting thrown out for the third out trying to steal 2nd.&nbsp; I can vividly picture Theriot on one knee at 2nd base with his helmet in hand, looking at the ump in a puzzled manner with the end-of-inning graphics at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; It also seemed that in 2010, especially, he was totally incapable of getting past the first 2 pitches without popping up.&nbsp; I can't help but wonder how much of his inability to work the count and baserunning can be attributed to Piniella and his staff.</p>
<p>So I hope that I've made it clear that I'm not a huge Theriot fan.&nbsp; But after witnessing the reaction from Cubs fans/bloggers/Twitter folks, it got me wondering why fans would lash out at a player this way.&nbsp; It was always kind of perceived that Theriot was a bit of a prima donna.&nbsp; Maybe there is more to that aspect of it that I'm not aware of because I live 180 miles from Wrigleyville.&nbsp; Perhaps he has a reputation that I'm not aware of.&nbsp; There was not much ugliness when Theriot left the Cubs.&nbsp; He was going to a supposed playoff contender in the Dodgers.</p>
<p>The Cubs received Blake Dewitt in return.&nbsp; Dewitt's numbers were a dropoff in nearly every offensive statistical category.&nbsp; Dewitt's batting average was 34 points lower than Theriot's, looking at their numbers with the Cubs.&nbsp; More importantly, in the areas of Theriot's game that frustrated fans the most, his base-running and fielding, Theriot was statistically better than Dewitt.&nbsp; We giggle at the idea of Theriot as a threat on the basepaths, but is it his fault that the Cubs had nobody on the team faster than him?&nbsp; Is it his fault he was the main basestealing weapon?&nbsp; Theriot averaged a steal every 4.5 games.&nbsp; In his 53 games with the Cubs, Dewitt had one steal.&nbsp; Theriot actually had a higher fielding percentage at 2nd base than Dewitt during their respective times with the Cubs.&nbsp; Of course, Dewitt is 6 years younger than Theriot, but are his skills going to increase dramatically to overshadow Theriot's numbers?&nbsp; Most likely they won't, and fans will become frustrated with Dewitt for not producing numbers that he's incapable of producing.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make the case for Theriot.&nbsp; What I'm saying is that Theriot is not a bad player.&nbsp; He is an average player.&nbsp; He is an everyday player.&nbsp; His skills are higher than a utility player.&nbsp; But he's not a star, and reasonable fans should not expect above average production from him.&nbsp; It just seems that fans nowadays have no appreciation for average players or guys who play a specific role on the team.&nbsp; Unless you call Yankee Stadium home, you are not going to see superstars at every position.</p>
<p>Now that he's in St. Louis, Theriot has made a few jabs at the Cubs.&nbsp; He made the comment that he is now on the "right side" of the Cubs/Cardinals rivalry.&nbsp; He also agreed, during an interview, that St. Louis is "baseball heaven."&nbsp; Of course, this does nothing but fan the flames of hatred that some Cubs fans feel for Theriot.&nbsp; But I'm not sure if I would blame him for being frustrated with Cubs fans.&nbsp; I think that it's a bad move to trash an organization that drafted you and brought you up through their system, but there appears to be no love lost between Theriot and the Cubs.&nbsp; As fans, we see the inept management (from the manager on up) of the Cubs.&nbsp; I can only imagine what these players see on a daily basis.</p>
<p>For those Cubs fans looking for Theriot to fail miserably in St. Louis, we probably won't see Aaron Miles-like production.&nbsp; He will fill the roles he's asked and if there is a club in the division that gets the most out of average players, it's probably the Cardinals.</p>
<p>To hear Theriot's take on everything, check out <a href="http://espn.go.com/espnradio/player?rd=1#/podcenter/?id=5874786&amp;autoplay=1&amp;callsign=ESPNRADIO" target="_blank">his interview on the Waddle and Silvy Show on ESPN 1000</a>.&nbsp; Even if you're a Theriot hater, you should check this interview out to hear his take on what went wrong with the Cubs in 2009 and 2010.&nbsp; Theriot is a very funny guy and this is a good interview.&nbsp; Check it out.</p>
