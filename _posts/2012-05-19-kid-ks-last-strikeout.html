<p>The Kerry Wood era is over for the Chicago Cubs and we look back on his career.  From his 20 strikeout game to his numerous DL visits, Kerry Wood earned a spot in the hearts of most Cubs fans and we look at the reasons that, despite disappointing career numbers, Cubs fans still adore Kid K.  </p>
<p>We talk about the last week in public relations with the Cubs, from Social Media Night to the Joe Ricketts situation.  </p>
<p>Ozzie Guillen quits Twitter and we read through some of our favorite Ozzie tweets.  The Crosstown Classic just doesn't seem the same without old Ozzie complaining about Cubs fans and rats.  We talk a little about Game 1 of the Crosstown Series at Wrigley, including Samardzija stoking the rivalry flames and Hawk Harrelson's incredible broadcasting skills.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
