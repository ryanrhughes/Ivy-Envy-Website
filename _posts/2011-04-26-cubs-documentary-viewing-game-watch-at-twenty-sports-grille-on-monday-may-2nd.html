<p>Throughout the season, we do game-watches at Twenty Sports Grille and Nightclub in Moline, IL.  We're doing something a little different with May's game-watch.  On Monday, May 2nd, the Cubs will be on the West Coast and play the Dodgers in Los Angeles.  This game starts at 9pm, but before the game, we will show the documentary, <u>We Believe</u>.</p>
<p><u>We Believe</u> is a film that was done by the director of <u>The United States vs. John Lennon</u>, and celebrates the relationship between Chicago and the Cubs.  Among those appearing in the film are Billy Corgan, Bob Costas, Dennis Franz, Jeff Garlin, Buddy Guy, Hugh Hefner, Ernie Banks, Gary Sinise, Billy Williams, Richard M. Daley, Ron Santo, Bonnie Hunt, Joe Mantegna, George Will, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and Francis Cardinal George, the Archbishop of Chicago.  </p>

We'll start the film at 7pm.  There is no cover charge.  So come on down and enjoy <u>We Believe</u>, have a few cold beverages and stick around for the Cubs/Dodgers game.  Twenty Sports Grille and Nightclub is located at 1405 5th Avenue in Moline, Illinois.  </p>
