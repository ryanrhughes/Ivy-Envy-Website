The Cubs won some close games and had to scratch out those games and that experience may come in handy in the impending wild card game.  </p>
<p>We look ahead at the pitching match-ups for the weekend series with the Cardinals that starts tomorrow.  We talk about Jorge Soler's return to the Cubs and his recent championship with the Myrtle Beach Pelicans.  We also answer some listener questions.  </p>
