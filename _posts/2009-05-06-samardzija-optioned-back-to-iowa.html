<p>Jeff Samaradzija will head West on I-80, back to Des Moines.  I'm glad to see him going back to Iowa.  Ideally, the Cubs would not have needed to bring him up already.  It's my understanding that the goal is for him to develop his third pitch in Iowa to become a Starter.  </p>
<p>Flat out, Samardzija did not pitch well in this stint with the Cubs.  He didn't look anywhere as sharp as he did last year.  He only got charged with 3 runs, but it seemed like he let a lot of inherited runners score.  I really hope that we don't need to see Samardzija for the rest of the year.  First, that would mean that our pitching staff stays healthy enough that we don't need to dip into the guys in Iowa.  Also, it means that he is receiving the development that he needs and deserves.  </p>
<p>I hope fans don't let this little blip leave a sour taste in their mouth with Samardzija.  He's still young and he over-achieved last year.  Hey Jeff, if you come through the Quad Cities on I-80, swing by and I'll buy you a beer.  Go Irish.  Go Cubs.</p>
