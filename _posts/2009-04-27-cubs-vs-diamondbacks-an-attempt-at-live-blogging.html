<p>We have set up a live-blogging program.  Tonight's game will be our first attempt.  It'll be just me throwing in some thoughts here and there.  We will typically use this live-blogging when we have multiple Ivy Envy guys together watching games.  The sketchy television coverage of Thursday night's game might lead to a first group live-blogging event.</p>
<p>We'll see how this test run goes.<br />
<br><br />
<br><strong>7:02:29 PM</strong>: Arizona is awfully close to Mexico. I expect the Cubs to continue the injury woes by 3 of their infielders being struck with Swine Flu.<br><br><strong>7:19:17 PM</strong>: Kerry Wood is pitching the 9th inning for the Indians with the score 0-0.<br><br><strong>7:21:06 PM</strong>: Jason Bay just took Kerry Wood deep with a 3 run homer.  Unless the Indians can come back in the bottom of the 9th, Wood gets the Loss.<br><br><strong>7:32:04 PM</strong>: The Diamondbacks activated ex-Cub Tom "Flash" Gordon today from the DL.<br />
<br><br><strong>7:40:07 PM</strong>: A series in Phoenix is the perfect opportunity to create a Bob Brenly Drinking Game. Share your ideas by commenting.</a><br><br><strong>7:51:49 PM</strong>: Lilly goes 1-2-3 in the first.  The Astro's beat the Reds 4-1.  Cardinals are up 3-2 against the Braves in the 9th.<br><br><strong>7:55:46 PM</strong>: I'd just like to remind you that Cotts threw 12 strikes yesterday.<br><br><strong>7:57:38 PM</strong>: The Cubs won't be making up any ground tonight.  The Cardinals beat the Braves, 3-2.<br><br><strong>8:09:37 PM</strong>: Fukudome nails Reynolds at the plate.<br><br><strong>8:11:49 PM</strong>: I'm hoping that Lilly gives me a performance to replace my last memory of him pitching in Phoenix....2007 Game 2 of NLCS.<br><br><strong>8:41:38 PM</strong>: A 4-pitch walk to start the 4th for Lilly.  He seems to be giving himself a little trouble every inning.<br><br><strong>8:55:18 PM</strong>: D-backs go up 5-1 in the 4th. This concludes the live-blogging test.  Time to watch the game from bed.<br></p>
