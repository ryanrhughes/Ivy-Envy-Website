  content: Just listened to the podcast, I agree with Corey completely on the changes
    to Wrigley. I have been to so many stadiums over the years and every one of the
    newer stadiums I've visited are the same. Music to make people cheer in key moments,
    t-shirt girls, same look. Wrigley is different and should stay different. A new
    stadium would take away one of the aspects of the Cubs that makes them unique
    and likeable. I fear that another key uniqueness will also be on the way out in
    the near future. That would be WGN. Every game in the 80s was on WGN in nearly
    every home in the US that had cable at that time. Half of the games still reach
    those same fans today. If they ever get their way with the "Cubs Network" thing,
    they will lose their biggest selling aspect. Sorry I got way off-topic, but these
    changes are related. Sure some change is good, but some change is bad too.

  content: "It's different, and it's historic no doubt, but it's also got some serious
    structural issues.   \r\n\r\nThe Cubs are on WGN and should STAY on WGN because
    Chicago fans deserve that at least."

  content: And I totally understand what you said about the changes being related.  If
    they do an overhaul, the next thing coming is the channel so you have a really
    good point there.

<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt, Ryan, Paul and regular guest Matt Veto record this episode at our live event at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline, Illinois.  We summarize the 2010 season, talk about the youngsters, discuss our opinions on Lou and look ahead to the next manager and some of this young talent.  Then, Paul drops a bomb on us and it leads to some pretty good discussion.  </p>
