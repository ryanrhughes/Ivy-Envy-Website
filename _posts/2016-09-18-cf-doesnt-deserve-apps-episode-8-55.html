<p>On this episode, we talk about the historical significance of the Cubs winning the division crown.  We also look ahead to the last two weeks of the regular season and talk about how we will begin to prepare ourselves for the 2016 MLB Post-season.  Andy looks at the health of the team, primarily Pedro Strop and Jorge Soler.  </p>
<p>Then we invite Lauren (<a href="http://twitter.com/blondewonk" target="_blank">@BlondeWonk</a>) to talk about <a href="https://www.gamedayfeels.com/" target="_blank">Game Day Feels</a>.  Be sure to use the promo code IVY to be entered into a drawing for a 19" bracelet.  </p>
