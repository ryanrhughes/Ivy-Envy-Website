  content: Those channels are off for Mediacom. Comcast HD is 732, Comcast HD+ is
    733, CoziTV is 106. In the Quad Cities anyhow.

  content: Cubs are not on this CoziTV channel. I guess no game being shown in the
    Quad Cities tonight.

<p>Comcast Sports Net has a busy night, as the Blackhawks and Bulls have playoff games and the Cubs go to Milwaukee for an evening game.  The Blackhawks game vs. the St. Louis Blues will be broadcast on CSN, while the Bulls game vs. the Washington Wizards will be on CSN+.  This leaves the Cubs (deservedly) looking for a home tonight.  If you decide you'd rather watch Carlos Villanueva match up against Matt Garza rather than playoff hockey or basketball, this image is from <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/channel-finder" target="_blank">the Comcast website</a> and will help you find the Cubs game.  </p>
