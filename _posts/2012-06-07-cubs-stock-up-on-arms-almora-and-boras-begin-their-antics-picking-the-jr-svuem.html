<p>After picking Albert Almora with the 6th overall pick, the Cubs went with pitching for the next seven picks. 22 of their 42 picks were pitchers. Here's a rundown on the Cub's top ten picks. I won't spend much time on the other 32 picks, but it should be noted that one of them was Rustin Sveum (39th round), Dale's son. It's not uncommon for team's to draft sons of managers as a gesture. It looks like Rustin will be going to college.</p>
<p><strong>6. Albert Almora, OF, Mater Academy HS.</strong> Almora is about as polished as high school talent can be. He has moderate power, good speed and is expected to hit for a high average. He should work is way through the farm system quickly and the hope is that we'll see another very young MLB debut. He's revealed a little bit of arrogance with his proclamation that he thought he would be the #1 overall pick. He is being "advised" by Scott Boras, who has already begun his usual shenanigans by "advising" Albert to say he wants to go to college. I think the chances of that happening are pretty low. He's got #6 money, probably $3 million+ bonus, essentially in his pocket. I can't see him, or money hungry Boras, giving it up to attend "The U". It looks like Boras is trying to push the Cubs in to offering more of the allotted bonus pool that is a part of the new collective bargaining agreement. The Cubs have just under $8 million to spend on signing their picks from the first 10 rounds. That cap is likely what kept them from drafting Mark Appel, another Boras project. Boras is looking for big money to sign Appel and will continue to make life miserable for the Pirates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.missouristatebears.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/johnson_pierce00.html" target="_blank"><strong>43. Pierce Johnson, RHP, Missouri State.</strong></a> (Compensation pick for Aramis Ramirez) In three seasons with Missouri State he is 11-13 with a 4.25 ERA. His 2012 ERA was 2.53 and he recorded 119 Ks in 99.2 innings. He has a strong mid 90s fastball, a good slider and already has a change up. He's had a few injuries, but nothing too serious. Like they say about all pitchers, "Good stuff with a high ceiling."</p>
<p><strong>56. Paul Blackburn, RHP, Heritage HS,</strong> (CA) (Compensation pick for Carlos Pena) How much can you say about high school pitchers. Stats are usually insanely good because they outperform there opponents at the plate. ERA under 2. Has potentially three pitches; fastball, curve, change. Throws in the low 90s. Has committed to Arizona State so it will be interesting to see if being a second round pick is high enough to get him signed.<strong></strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>67. Duane Underwood, RHP, Pope HS, GA </strong>Just 17 years old. Has a low to mid 90s fastball and a curve that needs work. Command is shaky, but he's 17 years old. Committed to Georgia.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>101. Ryan McNeil, RHP, Nipomo HS, CA </strong>The Cubs must have been confident that they could sign high school pitchers by drafting them early enough. There isn't a ton of coverage on the high school guys, but this one can dunk. There are a few <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Kf3wflwDDg " target="_blank">youtube videos</a> to prove it.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.goccusports.com/sports/m-basebl/mtt/conway_josh00.html" target="_blank"><strong>134. Josh Conway, RHP, Coastal Carolina</strong></a> Great numbers at Coastal Carolina. 14-3 with a 2.68 ERA. Was drafted by the Braves in 2009, but chose to attend CCU. Fastball, slider, change. Throws low to mid 90s. Projected as a starter.</p>
<p><strong>164. Anthony Prieto, LHP, Americas HS, TX </strong>Google can't even find much on this guy. This is what I know. He's a high schooler and he's left handed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.njcaa.org/colleges_college_player.cfm?sid=8&amp;collegeid=1737&amp;category=Roster&amp;slid=3&amp;teamid=122027&amp;athleteid=356745" target="_blank"><strong>194. Trey Lang, RHP, Gateway Community College, AZ</strong></a> A big guy at 6' 2", 230 lbs who throws hard. Recently converted to pitching while in college. Probably a bullpen arm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.virginiasports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=88824&amp;SPID=10613&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17800&amp;ATCLID=204859843&amp;Q_SEASON=2011" target="_blank"><strong>224. Stephen Bruno, 3B, University of Virginia</strong></a> After seven straight pitchers, the Cubs felt it worthy to break the streak for Bruno. After all, you can't draft ALL pitchers. A little small at 5' 9" and 165 lbs, but he'll probably bulk up in the minors. Had a .358 average at Virginia (2010-11, Virginia hasn't updated the 2012 season stats), but missed much of 2011 due to injury.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.uscbathletics.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=433" target="_blank">254. Michael Heesch, LHP, University of South Carolina Beaufort</a> </strong>Heesch is a Crystal Lake, IL native who transferred from U of Ill. Chicago to USCB, an NAIA school. At UIC he was 11-6 with a 5.03 ERA.</p>
<p>I'm not a draft evaluator so I won't pretend I know anything about these guys. I do like Albert Almora as the top pick. If they can get through the pain of dealing with Boras I think he'll be a good skill position player that should make his way through the system quickly and benefit from some major league coaching. The sheer number of pitchers drafted has to result in some nice surprises. Now, we wait and see. No one (people that know more than I do) is saying the Cubs had a bad draft. The Cardinals, however, are constantly being pegged as losers in this draft.</p>
