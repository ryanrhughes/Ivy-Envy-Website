<p>The Iowa Cubs continue to feed players to the big league team and Lou Montanez is the most recent to join the ranks.  If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Montanez, he&rsquo;s no spring chicken.  Lou is 29 years old and was drafted by the Cubs in the first round (third overall) in 2000.  He hopped around between Boise, Lansing/Peoria and Daytona in his first four years in the system.  In 2005, he got called up to West Tennessee from Daytona and then he was with West Tennessee and Iowa in the 2006 season, before becoming a free agent.  </p>
<p>Montanez signed with the Orioles and spent most of his time there between AA and AAA, although he did play 93 games with the big league club over the 2008, 2009, and 2010 seasons, batting .223 with 19 doubles, 7 HR and 40 RBIs.  At the end of the 2010 season, Montanez again became a free agent and signed back with the Cubs in January.  </p>
<p>Montanez does have some accomplishments worth noting.  In 2008, he won the Eastern League Triple Crown (Class AA).  Montanez also holds the distinction of hitting a homerun in his first major league at-bat.  </p>
<p>In 42 games with the Iowa Cubs this season, Montanez is batting .369 with a .429 OBP.  He does have a little pop in his bat, too.  He&rsquo;s hit 11 doubles, 3 triples, 5 HR.  His most impressive number is the 43 RBIs in 42 games.  </p>
<p>As I said, at 29 years old, Montanez is not a young prospect.  He will come in to fill a few gaps until Marlon Byrd can recover.  The Cubs have quite a few options in the outfield, so don&rsquo;t expect to see Montanez on a daily basis.  He&rsquo;s not a speedster, so don&rsquo;t expect him to blaze around the base-paths with Tony Campana.  But, like most players called up from Iowa, you can probably expect to see him play with a lot of effort.  </p>
