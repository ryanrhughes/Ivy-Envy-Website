<p>Let's get the most important thing out of the way first. It's pronounced <a title="Dale Sveum" href="http://www.misspronouncer.com/brewers.php?var=sveum_dale" target="_blank">Swaim</a>.</p>
<p>Sveum will be officially introduced as the 59th manager of the Cubs at a Friday morning press conference. He accepted a three year deal with an option for 2015. Sveum served as the Brewers' hitting coach for the past six seasons and was part of the 2004, World Series winning, Red Sox coaching staff. His only MLB managerial experience came in 2008 when he managed 12 regular season games and four playoff games after Ned Yost was fired, but was not retained as manager by the Breweres in 2009.</p>
<p>Sveum, also a contender for the Red Sox job, seemed to be at the top of the Epstein &amp; Co. list with Sandy Alamor, Jr. I'm guessing Theo and Jed wanted to get this deal done before their top guy was snagged by their former employer. Sveum's hiring leaves Boston as the only team without a manager after the White Sox and Cardinals went the former player route and hired Robin Ventura and Mike Matheny.</p>
<p>Sveum is the only hitting coach that Prince Fielder has ever had (if you exclude his 2005 partial season). Discuss.</p>
