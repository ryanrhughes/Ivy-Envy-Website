<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the events of the last week for the Chicago Cubs.  Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger are traded to the Orioles.  Andy breaks down the trade and talks about what the Cubs got in return.  Kurt goes through the other moves that were made, all of these benefitted the Cubs in their International Free Agent signings, which Corey lists.  </p>
<p>This episode has a lot of talk about the future, although we do touch on what is happening on the field with the Cubs right now, including Jeff Samardzija's statements on the Scott Feldman trade.</p>
<p>We bring three Internet Muscle Flexes to you, Kurt gives us the Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
