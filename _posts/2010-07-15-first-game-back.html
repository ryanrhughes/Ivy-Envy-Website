  content: "America's Funniest Videos is always very fresh and innovative.  Like I
    saw this clip of this guy who threw a ball at a wall and it came back and hit
    him in the crotch, and I'm thinkg:  \"Where on earth do they come up with this
    stuff?\"\r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: When will the Cubs/MLB realize how many people are unable to get these
    games on WCIU?  Oh well, to be honest, I wasn't heart-broken the game wasn't on.  Now,
    opening day?  That was bullshit.

<p>Hey!&nbsp; It's the first game of the 2nd half!&nbsp; Let's watch to see if the Cubs can somehow begin the process of turning things around!&nbsp; Oh wait... it's on WCIU.&nbsp; #@*%$!&nbsp; Well at least WGN has a bunch of <em>America's Funniest Home Videos</em> on.</p>
<p>**UPDATE**</p>
<p>I found a radio and listened to these two guys who called themselves "Pat &amp; Ron."&nbsp; And I'll be darned, but it turned out to be a nice way to take in a game.</p>
