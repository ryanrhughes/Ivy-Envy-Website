  content: I was pretty annoyed too. Lucha libre Soriano needs to knock off the act.
    I'm going to reveal his kryptonite...listen up Astros, breaking balls, low and
    away. He'll chase like a fat kid after cake.

  content: I bet Atticus Finch could defend him.  Heh "lucha libre."  At least it
    seemed like that big show he put on after the grand slam was from excitement and
    not cockiness, don't you think?

<p>I can't remember a time when a Cubs player hit in a game-winning run and I've disliked him at that moment as much as I disliked Soriano last night.&nbsp; I haven't hid the fact that do not like Soriano.&nbsp; I would love to see him and his streakiness off this team at the trading deadline.&nbsp; Of course, that's not happening.</p>
<p>I also disliked Aramis Ramirez for about 4 years, and although I'm not a huge Ramirez fan, Soriano makes Ramirez look like Pete Rose running the bases.</p>
<p>So who can defend this moron?&nbsp; Errors all over the place and still smiling, not leaving the batter's box on a routine ground-out (if the ump doesn't call "foul", you run), and stupid John Cena hand-motions.&nbsp; Defend away.</p>
<p>If this is the future of baseball, I'm done.&nbsp; No Cubs blog should EVER have to mention John Cena.</p>
