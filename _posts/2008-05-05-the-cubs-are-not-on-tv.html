<p>Well, ESPN can't be blamed for this, but tonight the Cubs are not on TV outside Chicagoland.&nbsp; Every once in a while, when the games are only on WCIU, our local cable company will throw the game&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-62"></a>on a public access chanel.&nbsp; No luck tonight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that this year, about once a week the Cubs have not been on TV.&nbsp; Next week, Wednesday night's game against the Padres is only on WCIU.&nbsp; I really miss the days that you could count on the Cubs being televised...every game...on WGN.&nbsp; I don't really have anything against Comcast Chicago.&nbsp; I like some of their Cubs analysis throughout the day.&nbsp; But the Cubs and WGN belong together....every game.&nbsp; I would think that would help with developing a fan base across the country.&nbsp; TBS no longer shows Braves games.&nbsp; The Cubs would be the on tv, every game in nearly every household.&nbsp; They would be the only consistent baseball on television.&nbsp; With the way it is now, only two...sometimes&nbsp;three games a week are on WGN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So tonight, I'll spend my evening with Pat and Ron.&nbsp; "Oh maaaan".</p>
