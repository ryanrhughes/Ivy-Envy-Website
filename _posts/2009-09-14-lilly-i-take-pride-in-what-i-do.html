  content: "That's interesting since we just talked about this on the last podcast.
    \ Kurt was saying that it doesn't seem like this group of players has a burning
    desire to win---for the city, for the fans, that type of thing.  \r\n\r\nIt does
    seem that DeRosa and Wood were those types of guys, even though DeRosa was with
    the Cubs for such a short period of time.  \r\n\r\nI would consider Lilly's remarks
    in-line with that desire to win for the city.  It's nice that at least one guy
    feels that way.  There are a few others on the team that I think are also like
    that, but you don't hear it verbalized much when the team is losing.  When you're
    winning 95 games, it's easy to say those things."

  content: Yeah, I'm glad you made that connection to the podcast... I wasn't really
    remembering that conversation when I wrote the post.  I think you are right about
    DeRosa and Wood--especially Wood.  He seemed to really love Chicago.  The more
    guys the Cubs have like that, the better.

<p>After his 7-strikeout performance on Sunday that improved his record to 12-8 (8-1 at Wrigley), Ted Lilly said, "I take pride in what I do.&nbsp; That's for sure.&nbsp; It's really important to me.&nbsp; This is a pretty special opportunity I have, not only to play Major League Baseball, but to be able to do it here in Chicago.&nbsp; I think anyone in their right mind would consider themselves pretty fortunate."</p>
<p>You've got to love it when a&nbsp;person&nbsp;who makes&nbsp;a lot of money is grounded enough to remember how&nbsp;fortunate&nbsp;and blessed he/she is to be in that situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lilly sounds grateful in this quotation.&nbsp; Is there an implication that there are some players&nbsp;surrounding him who might not be in&nbsp;"their right minds?"&nbsp; Maybe so, but at any rate, some of the other Cubs players should be trying to emulate Lilly's attitude.&nbsp; When&nbsp;people take pride in their work, they want to work to the best of&nbsp;their&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp; I think more often than not, that type of effort equates to winning, and Ted Lilly's record since he has been a Cub proves that point.&nbsp; I think it will take a team full of players who take pride in their work to get the job done.&nbsp; The TLFC might be on to something with that cloning machine...</p>
