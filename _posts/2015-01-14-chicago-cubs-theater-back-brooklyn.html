<p>When I began scouring the Internet for full game videos for this series, this game was one of the first I came across and, though it's not video, I absolutely bookmarked it. While it's only a radio call - and the opposing team's call, at that - it's well worth it. That's legendary broadcaster Vin Scully coming around the 6:30 mark to call the game. From the Dodgers' final season in Brooklyn, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BRO/BRO195706040.shtml">the June 4, 1957 game</a> features a slew of legends: Ernie Banks, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, Roy Campanella, and even a young Don Zimmer. But the bonus is the pitching performance by a 21-year-old Sandy Koufax. </p>
<p>Unlike last week, I didn't annotate this game. To be honest, I had such a blast listening to the game, I stopped keeping track of what was happening. Instead, I've pasted the info from the game's YouTube page below and you can always consult the boxscore linked in the paragraph above. </p>
<blockquote><p>Vin Scully and Sandy Koufax early in their legendary careers! Original full radio broadcast from the Dodgers radio network, originally preserved by WOKO, Albany, NY. Tuesday night, June 4, 1957, the Dodgers return from a 9 game PA trip to come home to face the Cubs, with a young Sandy Koufax taking the mound. After the intro by Jerry Doggett, an also young Vin Scully (starts at 6:43) calls the first 3 innings, with some middle-innings work later; Doggett does the last 6 innings, along with some between-innings work also. Al Helfer also contributes between innings, and does the quick post-game at the end. Dodgers prevailed, 7-5, as Sandy got the win and Clem Labine got the save. Campanella hits a 2-run double off the scoreboard in the first, and also there were 4 home runs: Snider in the 3rd, Hodges in the 5th, Speake of the Cubs in the 6th and Ernie Banks in the 8th. Also, Joe Pignatano makes his major league debut (discussion starting at 1:07:14) after Campy is hit by a pitch in the 3rd inning. The sounds of the fans, vendors and Ebbets announcer Tex Rickards (first heard at 4:10) are heard throughout the game. A classic time capsule of the Dodgers' last season in Brooklyn, enjoy!</blockquote></p>
