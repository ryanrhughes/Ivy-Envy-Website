<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />This episode was recorded moments after the Cubs beat the Dodgers 10-2 in Game 4 of the 2016 NLCS. The mood of this episode is quite a bit different compared to the tone of last night's post-game show.  We celebrate the Cubs' offense coming to life, including spectacular offensive performances by Anthony Rizzo and Addison Russell.</p>
<p>We preview Game 5 and we will be doing another live post-game show right after that game on Thursday. </p>
