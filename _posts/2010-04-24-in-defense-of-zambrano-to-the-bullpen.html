<p>I spent some time on baseball reference this morning looking at relief pitching stats, and guess which team leads the National League in &ldquo;losses in relief?&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s right, your Chicago Cubs with 6.&nbsp; Yes, the offense hasn&rsquo;t been great or clutch or whatever, but the bullpen is a festering wound, and if we don&rsquo;t get some major surgery soon, we&rsquo;re going to lose the patient (the patient being the whole damn 2010 season).&nbsp; A butterfly bandage is not going to cut it; get me Dr. Jack Shephard!&nbsp; So it was time for a gutsy move like moving Z to the bullpen <strong>temporarily</strong>.&nbsp; It shows that Lou is unwilling to just let this season slide slowly into the abyss.&nbsp; I see Carlos as a guy who inspires confidence, and maybe those young guys down there need some iron on which to sharpen themselves (the Cubs have the 5<sup>th</sup> youngest staff in the NL).&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think just moving Gorzelanny or Silva to the &lsquo;pen was going to do much good.&nbsp; In my mind, Gorzelanny is the same damn pitcher as Marshall.&nbsp; And Silva appears to be back to being the gaping Kraken maw that swallows innings by the boatload, so why have him pitch only one or two at a time?</p>

<p>Also, Z has the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that is just not present down in the bullpen (or that has yet to show up).&nbsp; Plus, the rest of the rotation has shown that they can hold it down without Zambrano.&nbsp; And if they start to show that they can&rsquo;t, well, we bring Z back into the rotation.&nbsp; So settle down, kids&hellip; we are just trying to fix a big problem with a part of the machine that appears to be moveable at the moment.</p>
