A few podcast episodes ago, I mentioned a new Cubs blog, <a href="http://www.miCubs.com" target="_blank">miCubs.com</a>. &nbsp;miCubs is run by Brian Bedo and Jordan Bernfield, who used to do the BSquared Show. &nbsp;Their site is a great resource for anyone that's interested in the Cubs' complete organization. &nbsp;Brian has worked in the minor league system and has a great understanding and superb insight into the farm system.</p>
<p>This week, Ivy Envy was featured as miCubs.com's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blog of the Week</span>. &nbsp;Brian did an audio interview with me and posted it, along with a write-up about our site. &nbsp;Go check out the article/interview <a href="http://www.micubs.com/resources/view/cubs-blog-of-the-week-629" target="_blank">here</a>, and add their site to your list of Cubs sites to frequent.</p>
