As we mentioned on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5596" target="_blank">the last podcast episode</a>, this was a rough week for us at Ivy Envy. &nbsp;Last Friday, the Cubs released Fernando Perez, who was on the 40-man roster and playing with Iowa. &nbsp;When Perez came over to the Cubs from the Rays with Matt Garza in the off-season, we discovered how fascinating Perez is.&nbsp; Shortly after he was acquired by the Cubs, I wrote a post entitled <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3569" target="_blank">"Let me sell you on Fernando Perez."</a></p>
<p>If you have not read that post, I included two videos that I can guarantee will sell you on him. &nbsp;For the record, our appreciation of Perez had nothing to do with the fact that we wanted to get on his good side <a href="http://deadspin.com/5731907/the-way-we-live-now-new-cubs-outfielder-responds-to-mockery-on-his-tumblr" target="_blank">after he called out another Cubs blogger</a> for a poorly-written and lame attempt at humor.</p>
<p>After finding these two videos, I did a little more in-depth research (Wikipedia) and discovered the Perez is an Ivy League-educated individual. &nbsp;Perez studied creative writing and American studies at Columbia. &nbsp;He was also the first MLB player to be published in a poetry magazine.</p>
<p>At that point, I discovered his Twitter account, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/outfieldrambler" target="_blank">@outfieldrambler</a>, and found myself entertained, but often confused by his tweets. &nbsp;I am not a literary fellow. &nbsp;In fact, I hesitate even posting this out of fear that he would read it at some point and discover multiple writing errors in every sentence.</p>
<p>While nearly every other Cubs fan thinks of Mark DeRosa and his charming smile when they hear "Ivy League-educated baseball player," I will think of Fernando Perez and his love for humor, politics, and good music. &nbsp;Kurt and I were able to see Perez in a game shortly before he was sent to the minor league camp at Spring Training. &nbsp;While we are in our 30's, we are still childish and find ourselves fascinated with things that a normal person wouldn't pay any attention to. &nbsp;If you listened to our podcast episodes from Spring Training, you'll know that Perez's gazelle-like strides even caught our attention.</p>
<p>The morning we left Arizona, we decided we'd stop at the minor league camp at Fitch Park to see if Perez was there, as he had been sent there the previous day. &nbsp;Sure enough, Fernando was there. &nbsp;I knew that the idea of awkwardly saying "hi" to him would probably be more painful for him than myself, so I decided to spare him from the situation.</p>
<p>I was finally able to greet Fernando as he came down the tunnel at Werner Park in Omaha, as the Iowa Cubs played the Omaha Stormchasers. &nbsp;The guys made fun of me a little on the podcast for getting Perez's attention by calling out his Twitter name, but I knew it would be more likely to get his attention than simply yelling out his name. &nbsp;He acknowledged me and then strolled across the baseball diamond, balancing a baseball bat on his chin. &nbsp;Now if you think this guy is not worth being slightly obsessed with, you aren't anyone I would want to be friends with.</p>
<p>It's guys like Perez who make baseball interesting. &nbsp;If baseball had more players like him (intelligent, creative, good taste in music, great sense of humor) and fewer arrogant, homophobic mouth-breathers (Cincinnati Reds), the game would be in better shape.</p>
<p>So here's our official farewell to Fernando Perez. &nbsp;Here's hoping he lands on his feet with a club and is able to break through to the majors again. &nbsp;It does not matter the color of the uniform, I will be a fan and following Fernando Perez's exploits.</p>
