  content: Does this mean Wrigley will have the first, fully enclosed bullpens? Or
    has another team done that before. I like the design, but I'm sad to see the bullpens
    are getting shoved underneath the bleachers.

  content: Kurt Sutton I can't think of another ballpark that has fully enclosed bullpens.  I
    can understand why you'd want them visible, but on the other hand, the television
    broadcast usually only shows a quick shot or two of whoever is warming up.  I
    would guess there will be cameras in there to show us what's going on.

  content: I thought I wouldn't like it but it is alright. Please keep the wall of
    ivy and the hand scoreboard in tact and as an old Cub fan I won't fuss too much.
    Life always has changes.

  content: "I like the \"coziness\" that the various outfield signs and what not bring
    to the field, but not sure about the cursive signs in left and right field. There
    has to be a more aesthetically pleasing way to do both. \nHonestly, if they're
    going to stay for twenty or more years, I'm pleased they are upgrading. My real
    wish, as unrealistic as it is, would be to have a lakefront stadium, ala AT&amp;T
    Park in San Francisco."

<p>Last week, the Cubs and Tom Ricketts released a video that informed us of their intentions to push forward with Wrigley renovations.  Today, new renderings of the updated renovations plans were released.  This is a 4-year renovation plan.<br />

<p>You can't help but notice the (lack of) views from the rooftops in these images. After hearing that the bullpens would be under the bleachers, it appears that the wall, and more importantly ivy, will remain relatively untouched.  </p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://twitter.com/BruceMiles2112" target="_blank">Bruce Miles tweeted</a> that the Cubs will break ground on the new clubhouse in mid-July. </p>
<p>What do you think about these images?</p>
