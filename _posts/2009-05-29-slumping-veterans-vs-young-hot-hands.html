  content: I definitely agree with your post.  But I am wondering why Soriano isn't
    more clutch.  I'd be interested to know how he is doing with RISP.  And by the
    way, Scales hit a home run in the 8th!  (I just added that last part to antagonize
    you)

<p>There's been quite a bit of discussion in the Cubs blog-world about benching slumping veterans in favor of the young hot hands.&nbsp; I don't understand this and I don't mean to discount Hoffpauir's talents, but I'd take Derek Lee in the lineup over Hoffpauir every game.</p>
<p>This is typically one of those arguments that is purely speculation and there's really not much of a way to prove or disprove either side.&nbsp; However, I think that last night's 2-1 loss to the Dodgers was as close as I will get to being able to back my side of the issue.</p>
<p>The point in the game where veteran leadership comes in to play is the late-innings.&nbsp; That's when "clutch play" is required.&nbsp; In last night's game, two veterans that have been lambasted for their poor play came through in the 9th inning with clutch hits.&nbsp; Milton Bradley and Derek Lee started off the 9th inning with base hits and Geovany Soto was intentionally walked.&nbsp; Then, both Bobby Scales and Jake Fox struck out.&nbsp; These are unproven guys, but I have heard both labeled as "the hot hand".</p>
<p>I'm not about to fault them for their strikeouts.&nbsp; It just shows that you can have a lineup full of young talented hot-hands, but proven veterans can handle pressure and are much more likely to come through when you need them.</p>
<p>And yes, I'm aware that Bobby Scales hit a homerun in the 8th.</p>
