<p>The Cubs had more roster moves in their back pocket tonight after designating Darwin Barney for assignment earlier in the day.  </p>

<p>Cubs promoting Jorge Soler to Triple-A Iowa and moving Albert Almora up to Double-A Tennessee.</p>&mdash; Patrick Mooney (@CSNMooney) <a href="https://twitter.com/CSNMooney/statuses/491785129807708161">July 23, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>These moves capped off a wonderful evening of Cubs baseball as the youngsters carried the team.  Kyle Hendricks earned his first MLB win and the Cubs were offensively fueled by two home runs by Rizzo and one home run by Arismendy Alcantara.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jorge-Soler-Cubs-suspended.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jorge-Soler-Cubs-suspended-300x199.jpg" alt="Jorge Soler" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9905" /></a>Because of his contract (and spot on the 40-man roster) <strong>Jorge Soler</strong> is on a different track than the other prospects in the Cubs system.  In his third season in the Cubs organization, Soler has under 100 games of experience at levels more advanced than the Rookie League.  </p>
<p>Soler has battled injuries last season and the first half of this season, but his impressive numbers at the AA level were enough for the Cubs to move Soler to Iowa.  In 21 games at AA Tennessee, Soler was hitting .410/.500/.852 with 6 home runs.<br />
On tonight's television broadcast of the Cubs game, Len and JD were speaking with Patrick Mooney and the possibility of Soler being called up to the Cubs in September was discussed.  </p>
<p><strong>Albert Almora</strong> heads to AA Tennessee after hitting .280/.304/.396 in High-A Daytona.  His offensive numbers look somewhat puny compared to the silly numbers Soler, Bryant and Baez are putting up, but Almora is a pleasure to watch in the field and that's where his strength lies.  He is no slouch at the plate, but look for him to hit for average more than put up monster home run numbers like the others. </p>
<p>If you'd like to hear an interview we did with Albert Almora, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-22-interview-with-cubs-prospect-albert-almora/" target="_blank">you can listen to it here</a>.</p>

<p>Like the Darwin Barney move, this move with <strong>Mike Olt</strong> shouldn't surprise anyone.  He's really struggled this season and the Cubs are sending him to Iowa to get some consistent playing time and probably get a little confidence back.  Olt has looked completely lost and overmatched at the plate recently.  Olt is striking out in about 40% of his at-bats.  </p>
<p>Because 3<sup>rd</sup> base is occupied by Kris Bryant, Olt will probably play 1<sup>st</sup> base, DH and some outfield.  </p>
<p>I hate to end things on a sour note, but the promotion of Soler and Almora, as well as the performances by Rizzo and Castro this season, and how well Alcantara seems to be adapting to big league pitching should really excite Cubs fans about the (increasingly become more near) future.  </p>
<p>I was on the fence about getting back to Iowa for a game this season, but a line-up that includes Bryant, Baez and Soler is pretty enticing.  </p>
