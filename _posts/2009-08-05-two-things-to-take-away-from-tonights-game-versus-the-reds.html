<p>1.&nbsp; The Cubs, yet again, make an un-proven and mediocre (at best) pitcher look like the best pitcher in baseball.&nbsp; I understand that if guys haven't faced a pitcher before, it might take an at-bat to get used to his release.&nbsp; But Lehr wasn't getting his fastball out of the mid-80's and he held the Cubs to four measley hits.&nbsp; That's right, a lineup with Derek Lee, Milton Bradley, Aramis Ramirez and Alfonso Soriano could only manage four hits.&nbsp; And one of them came from Harden.&nbsp; This dude is 32 years old and just pitched his second career start tonight....a four hit, complete game shutout...against the two-time defending division champions.&nbsp; Good for him.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Soriano got picked off first base.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soriano continues to demonstrate that his head is never in the game.&nbsp; I don't care how many lead-off homeruns he's hit.&nbsp; I don't care how hot he can get at times.&nbsp; He's horrendous in the outfield and he's lazy in all aspects of the game.&nbsp; In a game where it was evident that the team would need to manufacture runs against an un-hittable pitcher in ....Justin Lehr, Soriano got caught with his hands on his hips leading off first base.&nbsp; But why would he change his game? Lou isn't going to bench him for getting picked off or jogging to a ball rattling around in the corner while the guy that just hit it is gunning for a triple. Plus that monster paycheck is coming in regardless of his performance.</p>
<p>I seriously want to hear a solid pro-Soriano argument.</p>
