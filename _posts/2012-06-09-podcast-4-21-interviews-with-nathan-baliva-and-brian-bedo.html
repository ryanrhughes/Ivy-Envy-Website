<p>We have a few interviews for you on this episode.  Before we get into the interviews, Andy, Bob, Corey and Kurt discuss Starlin Castro's latest "head in the clouds" moment and debate how the Cubs and Dale Sveum should handle these types of situations with Castro.  </p>
<p>Nathan Baliva of the Peoria Chiefs comes on and talks about the Chiefs' recent stretch of winning baseball.  Two of the Cubs top prospects in Gerardo Concepcion and Javier Baez are in Peoria right now.  Nathan gives us some insight into what may be leading to Concepcion's struggles.  </p>
<p>Then, we speak with Brian Bedo of MiCubs.com and we look at the Cubs picks in the 2012 draft, including the 6th overall pick, Albert Almora.  We also ask him about some of the guys in the minor league system:  Josh Vitters, Dan Vogelbach, Hayden Simpson and others.  </p>
<p>The episode is a little longer, but there's lots of good stuff in here.  </p>
