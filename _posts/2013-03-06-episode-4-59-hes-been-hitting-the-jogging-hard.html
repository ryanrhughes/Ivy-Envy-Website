<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt look over the last week in Cubs baseball, which mainly involves injuries and a single Spring Training win.  </p>
<p>Matt Garza will start the 2013 season on the DL.  Garza and Scott Baker account for 40% of the starting rotation of the team and with both on the DL, it's a good things the Cubs stocked up on starting pitching in the off-season.  </p>
<p>Starlin Castro will be returning in the next 3 or 4 days from his hamstring injury.  We talk about why this injury doesn't concern us and what other factors might be at play with Castro sitting the first few weeks of Spring Training.  </p>
<p>Ian Stewart's situation remains one of the most interesting story-lines of Spring Training.  We explain why we think this.  He's reportedly been fielding "light ground balls" and as Andy puts it, "He's been hitting the jogging hard. </p>
<p>We take a look at some of the youngsters that are getting some playing time during Spring Training: Brett Jackson, Javier Baez, Jorge Soler and Junior Lake.  We look at the numbers and try to read into them a little bit.  It would sure be nice if just a few early Spring Training games were broadcast on television so we could see these guys at the plate and in the field.  </p>
<p>Brett over at Bleacher Nation posted an interesting article on <a href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2013/02/28/source-cubs-seriously-exploring-branding-changes-including-new-logo-new-uniforms-and-a-jumbotron/" target="_blank">some of the branding changes the Cubs are considering implementing</a>.  While our tagline says "strong opinions", the truth is that over our 4 years of podcasting on the Cubs, we haven't had very many opportunities to express strong opinions.  At least not strong opinions that anyone would disagree with.  Nobody is going to argue that Luis Valbuena is the long-term 3rd baseman.  But the content of this Bleacher Nation article gives us some good healthy conflict on changes to uniforms and the idea of a JumboTron.  </p>
<p>In the chat, DeRose posted a few links some mock-up uniforms that were posted on Reddit.  You can find those <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nW09l3p.png" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PxHKzf4.png" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p>Corey discovers a Twitter account that captures some of the same essence that we are looking for in our Internet Muscle Flex of the Week and reads some tweets.  Check them out and give them a follow - <a href="http://twitter.com/facebookcubs" target="_blank">@FacbookCubs</a>.</p>
<p>Then we pick the winner for this week's photo caption contest and end the abnormally lengthy episode.  </p>
