    Can you address data usage? Any idea how much data each game uses at say the highest quality? More and more Internet providers are using data caps. It'd be interesting to know how much you can watch before paying more.

    It looks like I'm tethered to cable for another 2 years since I just signed a new contract, but it only worked out to $20 above the cost of my Internet, so that's not too bad.

    I just eliminated my tv also but have not bought mlbtv.  I did buy a Roku which I would highly suggest and a hulu package.  I do remember seeing a MlbTv app for the roku
    When I used cellular internet on an unlimited package streaming high quality video was around 1gb an hour. So a unlimited plan would be needed.

    I've used MLB.tv for a while now, living in Chicago. But we moved over the winter out to San Francisco for a new job so I'm definitely relying on MLB.tv for all Cubs games. iPad app sometimes gives me trouble but they may be having an old iPad. Laptop works awesome and has multi-game views. One other thing: I just ordered the new Roku stream stick for our TV so I can stream MLB.tv to my HDTV which will be great for catching Cubs games when I'm at home (the time difference means a lot of listening to games on the radio feeds on the commute home at night). Downside: no multi-game view on Roku stream, but I'll still get Len &amp; JD. Anyway, MLB.tv is totally worth it not only for that but just to consume as much baseball as possible.
    One fun bit: If you do fantasy baseball, you can enter in your team and the laptop version will let you check boxscores and at-bats for your fantasy players. Pretty cool.

  content: Oh - and there are different IP address tricks you can always use to get
    around the blackout zone. When I was working at the Sun-Times, our Wireless had
    an IP address of Chicago but our wired internet had an IP address for NYC for
    some reason so I could watch Cubs games if my laptop was wired in. Of course,
    I would usually just change one of the newsroom TVs to the game but there ya go.
    It can be done!

    Jobber8742 &nbsp;I haven't found exact data numbers from MLB.tv, but there are a few calculators out there. If your ISP has a data cap they should have a calculator on their site.
    An hour of the best HD video streaming will probably be in the 2.0-2.5 GB range at the highest quality. My plan caps at 250 GB per month (then $10 for 50 additional GB) so I'm getting 100 hours of HD streaming per month. That would be enough to cover a game a day for the month. Chances are I won't watch every game in its entirety in HD so I should be ok.

  content: Best thing I've ever gotten. I've been an mlb.tv subscriber for at least
    5 years. If you're worried about being blacked out, spend $50 and get a VPN.

<p>We talked about our Cubs new year&rsquo;s resolutions on <a title="Podcast 5.41" href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-41-oracle-galesburg/" target="_blank">Podcast Episode<span style="text-decoration: underline;">5.41</span></a>. Mine was to drop the $85/month TV subscription (the minimum on Dish network to get WGN and Comcast SportsNet) and cut the cord&mdash;go old school and get to know Pat and CoomDog on WGN radio really well. The only thing keeping me (and many others) is live sports, particularly Cubs baseball. I can manage without the rest of the garbage on the 200+ channels.</p>
<p>Most cord-cutting baseball fans have MLB.tv to turn to. I live in Iowa. I am considered &ldquo;local&rdquo; market for the Cubs (223 miles), White Sox (223 miles), Cardinals (261 miles), Brewers (265 miles), Twins (303 miles) and Royals (307 miles). If all those cities were &ldquo;local&rdquo;, Iowa City would be the greatest place in the world to live. All games in which any of those teams play would be blacked out for me. There are ways around it, but I won&rsquo;t detail those here. Google it. If you&rsquo;re web savvy you can make it happen for a few extra bucks a month.</p>
<p>This past week, I finally pulled the trigger. Even with the massively frustrating blackout policy, MLB.tv is a pretty good deal at $129.99 a year (postseason not included). I added MiLB.tv for another $25 to get my Baez fix. 90 minutes after games conclude they are available as an archive without blackout. There is also a condensed game feature allowing you to watch all the important plays of a game in rapid fire without commentary. I imagine the condensed games will be a regular part of my evenings when the Cubs play during work hours.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve watched about 4 games on MLB.TV. This is what I have learned so far:</strong></p>
<p>&bull; Customer service is non-existent. Spend 2 hours trying to figure it out on your own. Then call.</p>
<p>&bull; It takes some amount of technical knowledge to navigate issues. Don&rsquo;t encourage your grandparents to sign up if they can&rsquo;t install plugins, clear the cache, or navigate buffering issues.</p>
<p>&bull; The iPad version of the app is amazing with live stat overlays and DVR features. The iPhone version is good, but not as good as the iPad.</p>
<p>&bull; Video quality is very good with occasional jitters. If you have reliable download speeds (mine are 12-20 mbps) you won't have many issues streaming the HD video.</p>
<p>&bull; You don't get to see the Chicago commercials. Odd to say, but a good old 866-4-FELDCO or Bob Rohrman in your face has become part of the experience of watching a game on TV.</p>
<p>The blackout policy doesn't apply during Spring Training. We&rsquo;re rapidly approaching opening day so I&rsquo;ll keep you posted on how it&rsquo;s going. If it goes well you probably won&rsquo;t hear a lot about it. If not, there may be an angrier version of Kurt on future podcasts.</p>
