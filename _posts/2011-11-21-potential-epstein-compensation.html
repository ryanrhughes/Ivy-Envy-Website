  content: Vitters' placement on the 40 man is purely to keep him out of the Rule
    5 Draft.

<p>Carrie Muskat wrote that the Cubs and Red Sox will not come to an agreement on compensation for Theo Epstein until after the Rule 5 draft in December, but plenty of people have offered opinions on the matter.&nbsp; I saw that Nick Cafardo, a writer from <em>The Boston Globe</em>, thinks that the Cubs should <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2011/11/20/theres_a_working_model_for_managing_in_boston/?page=full" target="_blank">send Tyler Colvin to the Red Sox</a> and "call it a day."&nbsp; Tyler Colvin has played 221 games (spanning three seasons) for the Cubs, and he has hit .215 with 78 RBI and 163 strikeouts.&nbsp; I would rather the Sox took Colvin than a younger player.&nbsp; In fact, unless the Red Sox want to take Soriano and pay most of his contract, I can't think of a much better option.&nbsp; Maybe there is some mineral in the water in Boston that will help Colvin's eye-hand coordination.&nbsp; I'd be interested to hear what anyone else reading this thinks.</p>
<p>Things have been fairly quiet since the Cubs hired Sveum.&nbsp; Some people have been asking Sveum if he is going to push the management to go after Prince Fielder, but he has kind of brushed those questions aside.&nbsp; It is fairly safe to assume that the Cubs are not going for a big-name free agent.&nbsp; According to the same Cafardo article, Epstein will "listen to offers on Garza and just about anyone on his team."&nbsp; Though this statement appears to be just Cafardo's insight into the Cubs' situation, Epstein and Hoyer have repeatedly mentioned how they want to focus on building up the system.&nbsp; If they are considering putting any player on the block, it sure would've been nice if Hendry would've done a little more before the trade deadline last season.&nbsp; At least Epstein is going to have a lot more ownership over what this team will become due to Hendry's inaction.&nbsp; It is possible, I suppose, that Hendry's hands were more tied than we imagined due to lack of interest from other teams.</p>
<p>The only other news worth noting really is that the Cubs placed Jeff Beliveau, Junior Lake, Matt Szczur and Josh Vitters on the 40-man roster.&nbsp; I'm happy for Szczur.&nbsp; He seems like a hardworking and talented player.&nbsp; It looks like it's getting closer to sink or swim time for Vitters.</p>
