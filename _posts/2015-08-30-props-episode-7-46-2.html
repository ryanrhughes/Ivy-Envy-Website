<p>We cover lots of Cubs topics, the (then) current 4-game losing streak, September call-ups, Fernando Rodney, the playoff potential for the minor league teams, front office additions, etc.  But we cut the episode short so we could watch the bottom of the 9th inning as Jake Arrieta no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers.  </p>
