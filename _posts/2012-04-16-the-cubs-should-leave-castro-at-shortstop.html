  content: I agree with this.&nbsp; We should leave him in there until he can work
    it out, and what better year to work it out than this one?&nbsp; He's going to
    have to learn how to do it at some point, and as the saying goes, practice is
    how you get to Carnegie Hall.&nbsp;

<p>In <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7026" target="_blank">Episode 4.12</a> of the Ivy Envy Podcast, we predicted some of the 2012 stats for individual Cubs players.  I set the over/under on Starlin Castro errors at 25.  Through 10 games, Castro has 4 errors.  This has obviously raised some concern with Cubs fans.  </p>
<p>Castro's defense has been an issue since he came up with the Cubs in 2010.  He had 27 errors in 123 games that season.  In 158 games in 2011, he had 29 errors.  The hope was that his mistakes were more of the mental nature and the new coaching staff would be able to help him.  It didn't take Bobby Valentine's seven-minute rant on Castro in an ESPN broadcast last year for us to know that Starlin's head may not always be in the game.  But that rant did bring his defense and daydreaming into the national spotlight.<br />

Some people think the answer is to move Castro from shortstop, but I believe the Cubs should leave him at the position.  I don't believe the move is necessarily beneficial to the Cubs or Castro.  The Cubs have no other options at shortstop on the big league club.  Junior Lake has turned a lot of heads with his Arizona Fall League and Spring Training performances, but the 22 year-old has some minor league time ahead of him before he's ready for a move like that.  Even with the errors, Castro is clearly the best, and only every-day option at shortstop.  </p>
<p>I don't believe a move to 3rd base benefits Castro because you restrict the one strength he has as a fielder - range.  Castro makes fielding errors on the routine plays.  He seems to become more consistent the more difficult the play is.  In other words, the more concentration a play requires, the better fielder he is.  Third base doesn't allow for much range, and requires more consistent throwing.  Although, given his tendency to over-throw this season, perhaps putting him a few more feet away from first base may help (kidding).  The Cubs also have a few more options at third base, so in the short-term, this move doesn't make much sense.  </p>
<p>The other option would be to move Castro to second base.  While this position does allow Castro to exhibit more range, watching Castro consistently throw over the first-baseman's head from 15 feet away could be harmful to our health.  Speaking from my vast experience as a second-baseman in Little League, I can also say that the mechanics and footwork of turning a double play from that position is more tricky than the shortstop position.  It's easy to envision wild throws from a flat-footed Castro trying to pivot in a double-play.  </p>
<p>I think the route for the Cubs to take is to work with him on his defense at the shortstop position.  I don't think there is any easy fix via a position change.  I suppose the situation could be different if a move fit into the long-term plans of the organization, and while that may be an option down the road, I don't think it's necessarily crucial.  Instead, the coaching staff needs to work with Castro on methods of maintaining concentration and his throwing mechanics.  I do believe that we'll see Castro's defense improve this year.  From what we've seen so far in 2012, it can't get much worse.  </p>
