  content: I'm beginning to think that Olt may start off in Iowa. &nbsp;I think his
    bat (and eyes) are ready for the big leagues, but using his sore arm as the reason,
    it may give the Cubs more time to figure out what to do with Valbuena/Murphy/Barney/Bonafacio.

  content: CoreyFineran &nbsp;It would be apropos if he does start in Des Moines,
    I've been following him around pretty well the last few years. In 2011 he played
    for Myrtle Beach while I was an intern there and then in 2012 he was playing for
    AA Frisco while I worked for the RockHounds (same division) so I saw quite a bit
    of him over those two seasons.

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9092" alt="Iowa Cubs Logo" src="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs-300x272.png" width="300" height="272" /></a>March 31<sup>st</sup> is the date most Cubs fans are looking forward to as our baseball-starved brains thaw from the winter months and prepare for a 2014 campaign that promises a glimpse, albeit an abbreviated one, at the undeniably exciting future of the organization.</p>
<p>The date circled in Cubbie-blue on my calendar, however, is April 3<sup>rd</sup>, the home opener for the Iowa Cubs. Much of the exciting future that was referenced above looks very likely to be taking the field in Des Moines&rsquo; Principal Park that day against the Memphis Redbirds (is that a chorus of boos I hear?) and I will be there, happily passing on all the details to those not privy to the advanced look at Chicago&rsquo;s next crop of impact talent.</p>
<p>At least 75% of the (penciled-in) starting infield for the I-Cubs that day has a &lsquo;Major-League Regular&rsquo; tag attached to their future role according to Baseball Prospectus. For the sake of this piece, I am going to assume Mike Olt breaks camp with the Chicago squad, leaving Christian Villanueva the starting job at the hot corner for Iowa- at least until Kris Bryant hits his way into another promotion.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_9096" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="/uploads/2014/03/christian-villanueva.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9096" alt="If Mike Olt breaks camp with the Cubs, that leaves the Iowa Cubs 3rd base job to Christian Villanueva." src="/uploads/2014/03/christian-villanueva-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a> If Mike Olt breaks camp with the Cubs, that leaves the Iowa Cubs 3rd base job to Christian Villanueva.[/caption]</p>
<p>Villanueva can be overlooked in a system that suddenly boasts a cornucopia of third base prospects, not to mention he lacks the outstanding facial hair of the other Cub with &lsquo;Villanueva&rsquo; stitched across his back, but he is the real deal. Jason Parks has praised Villanueva&rsquo;s as the best glove in the system and while his bat won&rsquo;t pack the punch that Kris Bryant or a healthy Mike Olt can provide, the whole package is certainly capable of handling lofty expectations such as &lsquo;Cubs Third Baseman of the Future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Villanueva will likely share the left side of the infield with a guy you&rsquo;ve been swooning over for a while now, Javier Baez. After belting 37 bombs between AA and AAA last year, Baez emerged as a top-5 prospect in baseball. Parks has gone as far as to say his ceiling is the highest you&rsquo;ll find, surpassing that of other behemoth talents like Byron Buxton and Oscar Taveras. It is widely accepted that Baez has the best bat speed of any prospect in the game and a cannon for an arm that can comfortably handle the left side of the infield. Given Baez&rsquo; label as a &lsquo;generational talent&rsquo;, it is likely that he will only grace my presence in Des Moines until June when the Cubs have safely secured contractual control over Javy for another year. However long Baez stays in the PCL, it is sure to be worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>The third piece of the prospect-laden projected infield that I am looking forward to is switch-hitting middle infielder, Arismendy Alcantara. The speedy Alcantara has some pop from the left side (not as much power from the right) and though he could be a capable SS, looks more like a 2<sup>nd</sup> baseman, potentially manning the keystone as a five-tooler for the perennial Cubs contenders of the near future.</p>
<p>With at least three pieces of a bright Cubs future on the infield alone, this season in Des Moines will be worth keeping a close eye on. &nbsp;If you squint a little, the next wave of talent that will leave Iowa for the Friendly Confines looks a lot like the core of a team that could bring the first World Series Championship back to the Northside in over a century.</p>
