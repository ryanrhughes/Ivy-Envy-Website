<p>On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we're talking about the first few games of this Cubs/Cardinals series in St. Louis.  We get a bit distracted early in this episode when this happened:<br />

<p>We talk about the highlights and lowlights of the first few games in the series.  Corey is significantly more optimistic than some of the fans that are freaking out with the Cubs dropping the first two games.  There are a lot of positives to take away and we discuss those.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have made several roster moves recently and we discuss some of those.  We're a month into the season, so it's time to start voting for the All Star Game.  Corey gives you his hot take on fan voting, the timing of all of this and the hashtags.  </p>
