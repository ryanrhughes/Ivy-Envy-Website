<p>After months of preparation, we did our first weekly live broadcast of the podcast recording on Saturday. These broadcasts will be available to view on our website every Saturday morning at 10am Central. Just click on the "Live Broadcast" graphic. The broadcast is also available via the Ustream iOS and Android phone app.</p>
<p>I will probably pull a segment from each broadcast and put it on YouTube as a sample. So if you missed this week's broadcast, you can listen to the audio podcast version here on IvyEnvy.com, or in iTunes, Stitcher, Pocketcasts, TuneIn and many other podcasting apps.</p>
<p>Here's the segment from this week's broadcast. We are going over some of our over/under predictions for the 2012 season.</p>
