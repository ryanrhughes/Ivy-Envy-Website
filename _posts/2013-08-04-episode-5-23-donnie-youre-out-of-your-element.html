<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt have a few Cubs moves to talk about on this episode.  Eloy Jimenez is officially signed, Donnie Murphy makes his Cubs debut and Logan Watkins makes his MLB debut.  Valbuena hits the DL and the Cubs DFA Julio Borbon.  </p>
<p>Borbon was DFA'd after a boneheaded baserunning mistake in Friday's game against the Dodgers.  We talk about the Cubs making an example of Borbon.  Paul Sullivan is off the Cubs beat and we use the opportunity to complain more about Sullivan and also comment on the role of beat reporters and how things are changing because of social media.  </p>
<p>We have a good number of questions from listeners.  Then we get into the regular segments, the Scary Stat of the Week,  and the photo caption contest.  </p>
