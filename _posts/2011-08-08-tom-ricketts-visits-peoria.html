<p>Cubs Chairman, Tom Ricketts, is on a "trip" as he referred to it, around to all the Cubs minor league teams.  On Wednesday, he visited the Peoria Chiefs for the first time since taking ownership.  </p>
<p>Fans were able to purchase tickets to a luncheon with Tom Ricketts with the proceeds going to the Salvation Army.  The Peoria Chiefs had invited me to participate in the afternoon press conference, so I figured I might as well make a day out of it and go to the luncheon, as well.  I also thought it could be interesting to see what "normal fans" at the luncheon might ask the head of the organization.  </p>
<p>I believe there were 45-50 people in the room.  At Ricketts' table was his three sons, Casey Kopitzke (Chiefs manager), Jeff Fassero (former Cubs player and current Chiefs pitching coach) and Oneri Flieta (Cubs VP of Player Personnel).  As it turns out, these were fans, but they were (for the most part) corporate sponsors of the Peoria Chiefs.  So while there were some good questions tossed at Ricketts, there were not the questions that would make Ricketts squirm in his seat.  </p>
<p>This was my first "media" experience, outside of covering some Chiefs games and doing some interviews.  I made a rookie mistake and lost the audio of Ricketts talking during the luncheon.  I had planned on listening over it and giving you a summary of all of the questions asked.  Because I was recording the audio, I didn't feel the need to take any notes, so I'll just have to go off memory.  </p>
<p>Ricketts started off with a lot of the talking points we have heard from him before.  They wanted the Cubs to do more for the community.  He talked about their accomplishments in this area so far.  These things are great and I don't think anyone could object with the Cubs giving back to the community.  However, I suppose it could frustrate some fans to see the ownership putting energy and money into this area while the product on the field is doing so poorly, while fans continue to show up to games, buy souvenirs, and fork over 7 or 8 bucks for a beer.  </p>
<p>Ricketts also talked about building from the bottom up and spending a lot of time on the minor league level and new facilities in both the Dominican Republic and in Mesa for Spring Training.  Again, for the long-term, these are things that should benefit the organization.  However, when the team has performed as poorly as they have in 2011, fans have a hard time with efforts being put towards anything but what is on the field.</p>
<p>Ricketts also talked about the desire to make Wrigley and the surrounding area more family-friendly.  He said Wrigleyville is a great area if you're meeting up with college buddies for beers and a game, but if you are taking your family to the ballpark, your options are much more limited.  He pointed out that nearly all MLB and Minor League ballparks have areas for kids and families, and Wrigley does not.  He said they expect to do something like this with the empty lot just west of the ballpark.  </p>
<p>A fan asked about the future of Wrigley Field and he said that Wrigley Field is in their long-term plans.  Ricketts said that when you are in your seat, Wrigley Field is the best spot in all of baseball.  However, once you stand up and leave your seat, it is clearly not the best in baseball.  He mentioned that he would like to find a way for the funding for a large-scale renovation project to be shared by the organization and tax-payer money.  </p>
<p>There was a question that Ricketts deflected to Oneri Flieta, who is more knowledgeable in the area brought up.  The question was about the development of former Peoria Chiefs players that are still in the minor league system, specifically Brett Jackson, Matt Szczur and Michael Brenly.  Flieta stated that the center field and catcher positions are the strongest and deepest spots in the minor league system.  He said that Brenly is at Daytona because that is the place where he can get the most consistent playing time.  He said that Iowa is set with Wellington Castillo and Tennessee has two catchers that made the Southern League All-Star Game in Steve Clevenger (now with Iowa) and Blake Lalli.  Flieta said that he has been impressed with the development of Brett Jackson and Matt Szczur, a 2011 Midwest League All-Star from the Peoria Chiefs, now with Daytona.  Flieta also mentioned how impressed he is with Taiwan Easterling, who was just drafted in this year's first-year player draft.  Easterling was drafted in the 27th round and has already moved to Peoria from the Rookie League in Arizona.  Easterling is batting .324 with 2 HR, 10 RBI and 5 stolen bases in just 18 games with Peoria.  </p>
<p>There were some questions about the front office (Jim Hendry), Mike Quade and current players.  Of course, Ricketts isn't going to give any information on these types of things.  He handled them like you would expect, and similar to the manner in which he handled them in the press conference audio I posted a few days ago.  His answers were essentially, "We will address those situations and make the decisions at the appropriate time."  He didn't just leave it at that, though.  He said, "I think Jim (Hendry) knows what he's doing."  I tweeted that quote and I think Cubs fans found humor/horror in the statement.  I would prefer to believe he said that and subconsciously put an emphasis on the word "think".  </p>
<p>I did have the opportunity to speak with Tom Ricketts for a few minutes after the luncheon. He told me about his walks around Wrigley during games and how much he appreciates the support from Cubs fans.  He also talked about the pressure from the obligation he feels towards Cubs fans to put a winning team on the field, but also build the organization from the bottom up.  He also got a little dig in on media and bloggers (with a little grin when he said it) for focusing on the negative and twisting situations and quotes just so they can write a good column.  I desperately wanted to say "Yeah, that Paul Sullivan is a dick", but I managed to restrain myself.    </p>
<p>As for the press conference, I'd encourage you to listen to the audio in my <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6024" target="_blank">previous post</a>.  I recorded that to give our readers and listeners an opportunity to hear Ricketts' words as he said them, rather than my, or any other writer's, interpretation of his quotes.  </p>
<p>It surprised me that one of my questions had him stumbling.  It wasn't my goal and it's a little troubling that a fairly softball question such as "What is the area of the organization you feel you have made largest positive impact on?" would have him stammering.  Perhaps the fact I ended the sentence in a preposition caught him off guard.  I do take a little pleasure in knowing that his answer to my question was <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagotribune.com%2Fsports%2Fbaseball%2Fwhitesox%2Fchi-your-morning-phil-sun-devils-ricketts-guillen-20110805%2C0%2C28985.story&h=IAQDKZMitAQBxUirMApIkz4ju-6ErZdiBmVUnptrv7sRaIg" target="_blank">used in the Chicago Tribune</a>.  Thanks to one of our readers, Justan, for pointing that out to me.  </p>
<p>In listening to Ricketts and speaking with him one-on-one for a few moments, I feel like I had a better understanding that perhaps he does know what he's doing.  We knew the organization was a mess when the Ricketts took ownership, but I think it was in a much more disastrous condition than we know.  </p>
<p>The Ricketts family did not spend $900 million to run the Cubs as just a feel-good organization.  He wants this team to win and the organization to succeed.  But I think that since he spent that much money on the organization, he wants to win and be successful in the long-term.  He's not focusing on short-term success.  I understand that this approach might be difficult for Cubs fans that are tired of losing.  However, having an owner that is moving the organization in any direction towards possible success is something that us Cubs fans haven't seen in many years.  </p>
