  content: Did you happen to see that the Cubs 1st rounder this year was the Cub's
    29th rounder from last year?  Hmm...  Must really like that guy..

<p>*&nbsp; It's been kind of quiet here at Ivy Envy.&nbsp; We try to keep things moving along and fresh for regular readers, but it's tougher to write when your team rolls off 9 straight and 10 out of 11.&nbsp; I'm naturally kind of a criticizer <a id="more"></a><a id="more-93"></a>and you can imagine that it's been pretty hard for me to find major faults with this team since they left Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; It was nice to see Greg Maddux pitch again.&nbsp; The guy has still got it.&nbsp; I think he was just auditioning for a spot on the Cubs roster after the Padres admit they are out of any race.</p>
<p>* Yesterday was draft day and anytime I think of the Cubs drafting, I think of Earl Cunningham, the Cubs first pick in the 1989 draft.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of seeing Earl play for the Peoria Chiefs in 1990.&nbsp; He was ejected from the game for disputing a foul ball.&nbsp; Earl played 7 seasons and never made it out of Single-A ball for the Cubs, Angels and Rockies.&nbsp; What's even more impressive is that he struck out nearly half of the times he went to the plate.&nbsp;</p>
