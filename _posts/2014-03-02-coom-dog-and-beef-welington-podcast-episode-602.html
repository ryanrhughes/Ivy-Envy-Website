<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt finally have baseball to talk about.  The Cubs have played three games in Spring Training and on this episode of the podcast, we talk about the good and bad performances we've either heard from Mick Gillispie, Pat Hughes or Coom Dog or watched with Len Kasper and JD.  Just in the first few days, we've seen some things that should really excite Cubs fans and then a few individual performances that have been sub-par.  We talk about the positive things we've seen from Darwin Barney, Jeff Samardzija and Kris Bryant.  And we talk about the negative things we've seen - James McDonald's performance, Coom Dog behind the mic and Starlin Castro's injury.  </p>
<p>We read the questions you submitted through <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>Our new website will be launched Saturday, March 15th and we'll celebrate by opening up the Game Chat for that afternoon's Cubs game vs. the Mets, which will be televised on WGN TV.  So come check out the new site, watch some Cubs baseball and hang out with us.  </p>
