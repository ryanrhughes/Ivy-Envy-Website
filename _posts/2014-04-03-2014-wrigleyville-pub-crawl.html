For the 6th straight year, the Cubs blog <a href="http://acubsblog.com" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a> will be leading a pub crawl around Wrigley Field.  </p>
<p>After years of attending, I decided this year it was time for us to step up and help, so Ivy Envy will be teaming up with WAIW for the event this year.  We've had John from WAIW and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/THEMANBQUE" target="_blank">ManBQue</a> on the podcast several times and if there are two guys that can organize a pub crawl through Wrigleyville, it's John, his cohort Steve, and Jake from my all-time favorite Cubs blog (unfortunately no longer updates), <a href="http://www.thundermatt.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Matt's Saloon</a>.  This year's pub crawl will take place on May 31st.  </p>
<p>If you're not familiar with the pub crawl, let me explain it.  First off, the pub crawl takes place during a Cubs game, when the Cubs are on the road (vs. the Brewers).  Not only is Wrigleyville not packed to the gills, but the bars are essentially empty.  We will cover 9 bars in 9 innings.  That's basically all you need to know to decide if you are in or not.  My first year, I was a little skeptical of the idea because of what I envisioned a pub crawl in Wrigleyville looking like.  It's an incredibly nice group of people drinking Old Style in empty bars and that's why I keep going back.  </p>
<p>This year, things are starting off with an optional tour of Wrigley Field.  This is your chance to see The Friendly Confines from the inside before they (hopefully) renovate the place.  This is a 75-90 minute tour that involves about a mile of walking.  Rather than mess with a group of tickets and trying to sell them ourselves, you're responsible for <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ballpark/tours/index.jsp?content=daily" target="_blank">buying your ticket for the tour directly from the Cubs</a>.  We will be doing the 12 noon tour on 5/31.  The Cubs sell 50 tickets for each tour.  When I spoke to them yesterday, there were 48 tickets left, but they go in big chunks, so don't wait around.  </p>
<p>So here is the official schedule for the pub crawl, with the Cubs game starting at 3pm:</p>
<p>Pre-pre Gaming: Wrigley Field!<br />
Pre-Game: Lucky's Sandwich Company<br />
1st Inning: Nisei Lounge<br />
2nd Inning: The Stretch<br />
3rd Inning: Merkle's<br />
4th Inning: Mullen's<br />
5th Inning: Sluggers<br />
6th Inning: O'Malley's Liquor Kitchen<br />
7th Inning: Sports Corner<br />
8th Inning: Murphy's Bleachers<br />
9th Inning: Bernie's</p>
<p>So if you want to join us for this event, RSVP on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/225845124272878/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular" target="_blank">Facebook event page</a>.  There will be tshirts available for order in the near future.  </p>
