<p>Warning: The audio on this episode is poor.  The program recorded it from the laptop and not our mic's.  We apologize and it won't happen again.</p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about Silva's last-chance effort to earn a starting rotation spot.  We run over a few things that we have forgotten to mention in the last few episodes.  Then, we share another "I can't believe that happened" situation from the Minor League camp at Fitch Park.  Tim Sheridan, the Public Address Announcer at Hohokam gave us a tour of the park and we describe what we saw.</p>
<p>And lastly, we play an interview that we did with Cory Valentine and Matt Seamans from The Pizza Pit, a Quad Cities Style pizza restaurant in the Quad Cities.  Want to know why there is QC Style pizza in the middle of the desert?  Give it a listen.  </p>
