Pirates win series 2-1.<br />
Monday: Pirates 1 Cubs 0 (10 innings)<br />
Wednesday: Pirates 4 Cubs 3 (16 innings)<br />
Thursday: Cubs 3 Pirates 2</p>
<p>Cubs Overall Record: 1-2</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Good</strong></span><br />
As Cubs fans, we're pretty familiar with seasons starting with strong <strong>starting pitching</strong> performances. The Cubs got outstanding outings from Jeff Samardzija, Edwin Jackson and Jason Hammel. Combined, the starting pitching gave up two runs in 19 innings pitched, a .95 ERA.</p>
<p>Nobody expected <strong>Emilio Bonafacio</strong>to get off to the start he did in this series.  How about .688/.706/.813?  Although he got picked off twice in the series, I really like what his speed brings to this team. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Bad</strong></span><br />
<strong>Starlin Castro</strong> did not get much work in during Spring Training because of an injury.  You would expect Castro to get off to a slow start, and he did.  He looked a bit lost at the plate.  Castro hit .077/.200/.077 in the series.  It might take Castro a while to get up to speed.  </p>
<p>I'm sure he appreciated the day off on Thursday after Wednesday's 16 inning game, but <strong>Welington Castillo</strong> also struggled at the plate in his two games.  Castillo hit .100/.182/.100.  Obviously, this is not something to be overly concerned with.  Two games is about as "small sample size" as it gets.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Ugly</strong></span><br />
In recent memory, the Cubs have been awful with <strong>Runners In Scoring Position</strong>. So far in 2014, they are amazingly bad. In the first two games of the series, the Cubs went 1-27 with RISP.  </p>
