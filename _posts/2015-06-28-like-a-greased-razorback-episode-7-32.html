  content: I am a huge Arkansas Razorback fan living in Louisiana. I hate the Cardinals
    and John Kruk. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the opening of the podcast.
    Woo Pig Sooie and Go Cubs!

It wasn't a great week for Cubs fans.  After taking the first two games in their series with the Dodgers (against the #1 and #2 starters), the Cubs dropped the last two games in the Dodgers series and then lost the first two games in their series against the Cardinals.  </p>
<p>We talk about some of the things that have stood out to us in the last week, including the luck of the Cardinals and our disgust in their success.  We talk about some injuries, including Jacob Turner being shut down.  </p>
<p>We have several listener questions to answer, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
