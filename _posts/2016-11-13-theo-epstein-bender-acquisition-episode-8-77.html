  content: 'In case you still haven''t sat through the full epic of Game 7: I happened
    across a copy online, and upon downloading discovered that the only audio is ambient
    stadium sound. Not sure if it was broadcast for foreign language dubbing or what,
    but there''s a purity in watching the game without commentary that makes it less
    stomach-knotting and easier to bear.'

You will hear us briefly talk about our World Series hangover. Kurt gets us up to speed with the individual player awards the Cubs have won so far.We also talk about Conor Mullee, who the Cubs acquired to potentially pitch out of the bullpen.  </p>
<p>The majority of this episode is spent looking at the players on the 2016 Cubs team that are now free agents.  We share our thoughts on if the Cubs are a good fit for that player and vice versa.  </p>
