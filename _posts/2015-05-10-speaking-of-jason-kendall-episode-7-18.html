<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this, the 315<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the last of the Cardinals series and the entire Cubs series with the Brewers.  You can't have a discussion about the last few weeks in Cubs baseball without spending a lot of time talking about the bullpen.  </p>
<p>We start things off by talking about hearing the guys on Effectively Wild calling the Cubs "bulletproof".  Does this team feel bulletproof to you?  Does it feel weird to have anyone refer to the Cubs as bulletproof?</p>
<p>Five years ago, Starlin Castro was called up and made his MLB debut.  Lots of fans are down on Castro and we look back at the first five years of his career and share our opinions on Castro.  </p>
<p>Jake Arrieta has had two rough games in a row. After looking so masterful last year and early on this year, that could make one a bit nervous.  Corey does his best to calm those nerves and he has an explanation of what went wrong in those two games and why the results of those two games will not become the norm.  </p>
<p>We have several listener questions to read though.  </p>
