<p>It seems that ever since <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/chi-17-cubs-brite-chicago-aug17,0,2707961.story">Carlos Zambrano admitted to being lazy</a>, the anti-Zambrano crowd has ratcheted things up quite a bit.&nbsp; Of course, many of these people are the same ones that were giddy about his no-hitter last year and putting him in the race for the Cy Young the last few years.&nbsp; These are also the same people that love his excitement when he's pitching well and shun it when he's not.&nbsp; Cubs fans are fickle.&nbsp; They'll turn on you fast and Zambrano has been seeing this for about the last month with calls for him to be traded.</p>
<p>I saw Paul (you've heard him on the podcast) a few days ago, and he's ready to cut Zambrano loose, via trade or waivers.&nbsp; I disagree and saw a post on another blog that I found pretty interesting.&nbsp; I think it's a good read.&nbsp; Check it out.</p>
