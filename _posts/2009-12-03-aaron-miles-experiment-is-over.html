  content: So the hypothesis that Miles could fill DeRosa's shoes was proved wrong,
    huh?  I am disappointed to see Fox go.  Of course he is a much better fit with
    an American League team.  At first I was kind of irritated that they didn't use
    him to go for a bigger name player, but then I realized that salary would be an
    issue.  Hopefully these prospects become useful players.  Now let's hope they
    can unload Bradley to free up some space to pay someone good.

<p>There hasn't been much going on with the Cubs to pull me out of my blogging hibernation.&nbsp; I hope you can forgive us for the lack of activity on Ivy Envy.&nbsp; As a Cubs fan, I'm sure you can understand the need to take a little time off from our boys in blue.&nbsp; It's good for us.&nbsp; Expect an Ivy Envy podcast episode to be posted tonight or tomorrow, by the way.</p>
<p>But what could bring me out of my hibernation?&nbsp; <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091203&amp;content_id=7752932&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">Aaron Miles being traded!</a> The man that was brought in to replace Mark DeRosa failed miserably in 2009.&nbsp; In 74 games, he batted .185 and had 5 RBI.&nbsp; As far as 2009 Cubs that I did not want to see on the 2010 roster, Aaron Miles was right there behind Milton Bradley.</p>

<p>Miles was traded with Jake Fox to the Oakland A's for Jeff Gray, Ronny Morla and Matt Spencer.&nbsp; According to Cubs.com, Gray was placed on the 40 man roster.&nbsp; He had pretty decent middle relief numbers for the A's last year.&nbsp; I'm sure Cubs fans will have mixed feeling on losing Jake Fox, mainly because of the numbers he put up while in AAA Iowa.&nbsp; He was on a tear in Iowa and filled in for the Cubs well.</p>
<p>It's hard for me to step back and evaluate if the Cubs got the better end of this deal.&nbsp; The fact that Miles is gone distorts my perception of the trade itself.&nbsp; My hunch is that the A's came out ahead.&nbsp; With Jim Hendry's recent stretch of bad luck, I would imagine that Billy Beane would come out on top in that match-up.</p>
