<p>If you are at all interested in the Cubs anymore, I will be "tweeting" from the games in Phoenix for the next few days.  Follow along at www.twitter.com/ivyenvy for all the action.  </p>
<p>Also, it doesn't appear that we will have a podcast for you this week.  My computer took a dump 15 minutes into Jimmy's debut performance on the podcast.  All I will say is that you won't get to hear Jimmy's opinions on Dodgers fans unless we can get him on the next episode.</p>
<p>Signing off from the 91 Freeway near Corona, CA.
