<p>Randy Wells took a major step towards returning to the Cubs on Tuesday night with a rehab start in Peoria with the Chiefs.  The folks in Peoria are accustomed to seeing big names in with the organization make a stop in Peoria on their way back to the big league team.  Wells is the first Cubs player to do a rehab assignment with the Chiefs in the 2011 season.  Last year, Ted Lilly, Aramis Ramirez and Carlos Silva made appearances in Peoria.  </p>
<p>Randy Wells was placed on the Disabled List with a forearm strain on April 6th, after his first start, which was a win over Arizona at Wrigley Field.  Wells pitched an extended Spring Training game in Arizona last week and if all goes well, he could be back with the Cubs by early next week.  In his one start of the season, Wells allowed just one run on six hits and four walks while striking out six in six innings of work.  </p>
<p>Wells is familiar with the Midwest League, as he began his career as a catcher in the Cubs organization.  He spent the 2003 and 2004 seasons with the Lansing Lugnuts (Cubs affiliate, at that point), one season as a catcher and one season as a pitcher.  </p>
<p>Those at O'Brien Field were lucky enough to watch two MLB pitchers tonight.  The Quad Cities River Bandits sent lefty Brian Tallet to the mound.  Tallet was sent to the Disabled List on April 12th, also after an appearance against the Diamondbacks.  </p>
<p><strong><u>1st inning:</strong></u>  Wells gave up a one-out single to Nick Longmire before retiring the next two Bandits with ground-balls.  Wells' fastball did not look to have a whole lot of zip on it.  But it was difficult to gauge the exact speed as the "Pitch MPH" display at O'Brien Field was missing about half of it's bulbs. I don't recall seeing a pitch out of the mid 80's.   </p>
<p><strong><u>2nd inning:</strong></u>  The Bandits came out swinging on Wells in the 2nd inning with back-to-back singles by Chris Edmondson and Packy Elkins.  With runners on 1st and 3rd with no-outs, Wells locked things down and retired the next three to get out of the inning unscathed.  </p>
<p><strong><u>3rd inning:</strong></u>  Wells worked quickly and retired the River Bandits 1-2-3 batters in order.  He got Michael Swinson to pop-foul out to Chiefs catcher, Micah Gibbs.  He then struck out Nick Longmire and Cody Stanley hit a chopper back to Wells, who tossed to 1st baseman Ryan Cuneo to end the inning.  </p>
<p><strong><u>4th inning:</strong></u>  The inning started with an error by Chiefs shortstop Elliot Soto, allowing Jonathan Rodriguez to reach first safely.  Chris Edmondson and Packy Elkins collected back-to-back hits in the 2nd inning and went back-to-back again, with doubles.  Rodriguez and Edmondson both scored on Ekins' double, putting the Bandits up 2-1 with no outs.  Wells got the next two Bandits to pop out.  Then the Yunier Castillo, batting in the 9 spot hit a single, driving in Elkins.  At this point, Chiefs manager, Casey Kopitzke went to the mound and pulled Randy Wells and replaced him with Austin Kirk.</p>
<p><strong><u>Recap:</strong></u><br />
Randy Wells' final pitching line:  3.2IP 6H 3R 1ER 0BB 1K<br />
It was expected that Wells would pitch around 50 pitches and he was pulled after 48 pitches with 2 outs in the 4th inning.  Of those 48 pitches, 34 of them were strikes.  As I mentioned, Wells did not appear to be throwing much heat.  While the talent level in Class A is significantly lower, I don't think you can take much from this outing.  In the last 27 games with a Cubs starting pitcher, the Chiefs are 13-14.  I imagine that Wells was here in Peoria to work on some pitches and shake off the cobwebs.  I'd take more away from how he feels, physically, after the game.  </p>
