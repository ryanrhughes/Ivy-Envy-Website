<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WINNER-121.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WINNER-121-300x300.png" alt="WINNER (12)" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9969" /></a>On this, the 253<sup>rd</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcst, Andy, Corey and Kurt recap the Ivy Envy Iowa Cubs Meet-up this weekend in Des Moines.  If you missed this meet-up and you'd like to hit 9 Wrigleyville bars in 9 innings of a Cubs away game, this upcoming Saturday is the Wrigleyville Pub Crawl.  You can find information for it at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wrigleyville" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/Wrigleyville</a> or email corey@ivyenvy.com</p>
<p>Tom Ricketts and the Cubs released a video this week that indicates they feel they've wasted enough time and plan to push forward with their Wrigley renovations plans.  In a move that I don't think anyone saw coming (or believed at first), the Cubs have signed Manny Ramirez to a player/coach contract with the Iowa Cubs.  We answer listener questions, hear an Internet Muscle Flex and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
