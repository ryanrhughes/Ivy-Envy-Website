<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Baez.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Baez.jpg" alt="" title="Baez" width="239" height="300" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-7659" /></a>A few weeks ago, Andy and I sat down with Javier Baez in the Peoria Chief's home dugout at O'Brien Field and recorded an interview for the Ivy Envy Podcast.  You can listen to that interview <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7624" target="_blank">right here</a>.  </p>
<p>Baez was named as the Midwest League Player of the Week for the week of July 9-15th.  During the week, Baez hit .478 with three home runs, two doubles and two triples.  He had five RBI and two stolen bases.  For the week, his slugging percentage was 1.130 and his OPS was 1.630.  Baez is the first Peoria Chiefs player to win this award in nearly three years.</p>
<p>The 19-year old is ranked as the #2 prospect in the Cubs minor league system.  I doubt the Cubs plan to race Baez through the system, but I wouldn't be surprised to see him move up to Daytona towards the end of the season.  If you live in Central Illinois, or maybe a little further out and want to make a little baseball road trip, don't miss out on the opportunity to see Javier Baez while he is in the Midwest League.  Our hometown readers in the Quad Cities can see Baez and the Chiefs play the River Bandits (Cardinals) at Modern Woodmen Park July 31st - August 3rd.  </p>
