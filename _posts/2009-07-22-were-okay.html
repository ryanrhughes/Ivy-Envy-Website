  content: "I'll throw in a little more optimism. They're hanging in there with Soriano
    and Bradley hitting under .250 and 21 homers combined, Ramirez being out a huge
    chunk of the first half and Lee not really coming alive until June. I think the
    \"role players\" and even a few guys playing in Des Moines deserve a lot of credit
    for keeping them in it while the big four find what they lost (or get healthy).\r\n\r\nSo
    if the money makers start hitting just a little better this team will be pretty
    good. They've been so bad in the first half it'll be like making a deadline deal
    to pick up two or three power bats. Playoffs still make me nervous though."

    together\" seasons before.  I haven't seen them get it together in those types
    of seasons.  \r\n\r\nThis isn't May or June anymore, we're nearly in August.\r\n\r\nBut
    I hope you're right."

  content: "I'm not sure IF the big bats will improve a great deal, but if they do
    this division should be theirs. An improved Bradley/Soriano combo is better
    than a Matt Holliday trade. It's a weak trade market so I think the Cubs are going
    to need to do it with what they have...at least offensively.\r\n\r\nRemember,
    I have fewer years of heartbreak than you do so maybe optimism is a little easier
    for me to muster."

<p>The Cubs spent the first two games against the Phillies reinforcing my feelings that they have no chance in the playoffs (if they even make it).&nbsp; Two runs in twenty-two innings is abysmal.&nbsp; No walks in a thirteen inning game is rough.&nbsp; Losing a thirteen inning game on a walk-off three run homer is demoralizing, especially after the pitching performances turned in in the first twelve.&nbsp; The Cubs can sweep teams like the Nats all they want, but they will not convince most Cubs fans that they can do anything until they can defeat the elite teams like the Phillies.</p>
<p>Well, the good news is that the offense came to life in a big way today, and the Cubs defeated the Phillies 10-5.&nbsp; Had they been swept, the title of this post would've been "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfan5MacmsI" target="_blank">A Failure Pile in a Sadness Bowl</a>," but we're okay for now.&nbsp; The Cubs exhibited some patience at the plate today, walking nine times.&nbsp; One other interesting item from today's game is that they achieved the ten runs without hitting any homers.&nbsp; Normally I would be disappointed in the lack of power, especially in a very hitter-friendly park in Philadelphia.&nbsp; However, as one of the Cubs commentators said (either Pat, Keith, or Bob),&nbsp; Moyer doesn't make a ton of location mistakes, so hitters have to take his nibbling pitches that are on the outside corner and direct them into the opposite field.&nbsp; I love watching the Cubs string together a bunch of base hits and put together big innings.&nbsp; That's when they are a fun team to watch.&nbsp; Yeah, the homers are nice, and the team is kind of built that way, but I think it is a good sign when they can take a pitcher like Moyer and beat him how he is most likely to be beaten.&nbsp; The Cubs went 5-3 on that road trip, and that is not bad.</p>
