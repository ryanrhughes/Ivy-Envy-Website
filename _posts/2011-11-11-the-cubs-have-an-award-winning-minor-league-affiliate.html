<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Tennessee Smokies" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tennessee-Smokies.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="190" /></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This news is a couple days old, but the Tennessee Smokies have been named "organization of the year" in Minor League Baseball by the National Organization of Professional Baseball Leagues.&nbsp; The award is the John H. Johnson President&rsquo;s Award (first awarded in 1974), and it is awarded annually to the team determined to be the most stable minor league franchise.&nbsp; The winning team also must contribute significantly to its community, league, and the baseball industry in general.&nbsp; Winning this award is a great honor for the Smokies, who are the first Southern League team to receive it.&nbsp; This year, the Smokies averaged 3,960 fans per game, which is the highest they have ever had.&nbsp; The team won the North Division of the Southern League for the third year in a row and just missed winning it all.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Given the emphasis the Cubs are going to placing on their farm system going forward, this is a significant accolade.&nbsp; Many people have been dragging the Cubs' minor league system through the mud lately.&nbsp; It has been in our consciousness due to compensation negotiations for Epstein and Hoyer.&nbsp; The new front office has made it clear that the minor league affiliates will be a big focus for the Cubs going forward, and a significant amount of resources and money will be used to strengthen the infrastructure of the organization as a whole.&nbsp; The fact that the Smokies and the other affiliates will be getting better players and won't be gutted all the time for ridiculous trades is exciting.&nbsp; An already strong organization like the Smokies will just be getting better, and it's nice to see that the situation at the minor league level isn't completely bleak.&nbsp; Epstein &amp; Co. (threw that in there to anger Kurt) will have some foundation on which to build.</p></p>
