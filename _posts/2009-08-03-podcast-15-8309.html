<p>We record this episode at Twenty Sports Grille, a sponsor of the podcast.&nbsp; We're also joined by 2.5 new guests.&nbsp; Ryan and Brian sit in with us and Ian sticks around for the introduction and then leaves the table to pay more attention to the Cubs/Reds game and drink to prepare for Kevin Gregg entering the game.</p>
