  content: "I can't believe I forgot to mention Dunston as well.  Even though he was
    never a Cub, I'd like to also take this space to mention what a great job Dave
    Righetti has done in San Francisco.  He's has a lot of great talent but still
    he's made good use of it this year compared to last year.  \r\n\r\nDavey Lopes...Wow,
    haven't heard that name in a while.  \r\n\r\nDon Zimmer continues to kick death's
    ass everyday.   May he live to be 120...\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>I was pretty sure that I covered all of the former Cubs in the post-season <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3336" target="_blank">in my post</a> last week.&nbsp; On our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>, Charles was quick to point out that I forgot to mention Dennis Eckersley, who is doing the pre and post game shows on TBS.</p>
<p>I was watching the Giants beat the Braves last night to earn their spot in the NLCS and I immediately recognized a face in the Giants' celebration.&nbsp; There was Shawon Dunston in the group, enjoying the win.&nbsp; So I figured I should do a second post, looking at former Cubs on the coaching staffs of the playoff teams.&nbsp; I am sure someone will find some obscure coach that had a short stint either playing with or on a coaching staff in the Cubs organization, but here's what I have.</p>
<p>The Rangers have no former Cubs on their staff.&nbsp; Neither do the Twins.&nbsp; They were eliminated by the Yankees, who have two former Cubs on their staff.&nbsp; Of course, Joe Girardi is the manager and currently providing a percentage of Cubs fans wet dreams over the idea of him managing the Cubs next season.&nbsp; The Yankees have a bullpen coach that you might recognize - Mike Harkey.&nbsp; Harkey played for the Cubs from 1988-1993, and he was the starting pitcher for the first Cubs game I went to in 1990.</p>
<p>The Reds have been eliminated and I'd like to think that former Cubs manager Dusty Baker had something to do with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chris Speier serves as Dusty's bench coach.&nbsp; Chris was a hitting instructor in the Cubs minor league system in 1995.&nbsp; He is also the father of Justin Speier, who was drafted by the Cubs in that same year.&nbsp; I'm guessing that wasn't a coincidence.</p>
<p>The Giants have two former Cubs on their staff.&nbsp; I mentioned Shawon Dunston, who is officially the Defensive Coordinator.&nbsp; The great Lee Smith is the Pitching Coordinator for the Giants.</p>
<p>Davey Lopes played with the Cubs from 1984-1986.&nbsp; He now serves as the first base coach for the Phillies.&nbsp; Lopes has been a first base coach since 1992 and the Phillies are the six team for which he has served in that capacity.</p>
<p>The Rays have a guy by the name of Don Zimmer as a coach.&nbsp; You might recognize his name.&nbsp; He's been in baseball for 62 years.</p>
<p>I'd like to hear some of your memories of these guys from when they wore Cubby blue.</p>
