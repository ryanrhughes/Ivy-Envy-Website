<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Ryan review the miserable week in Cubs-land. &nbsp;We look back at the disastrous loss to the Astros on Tuesday, when Marmol blew a save opportunity. &nbsp;Bob from Moline asks us about the criticisms of Quade, which leads us into some Sandberg talk. &nbsp;We also comment on the criticisms of the Ricketts family. &nbsp;Jason from Moline asks about who we think should represent the Cubs in the All-Star Game this year.</p>
<p>Then, we welcome back John from Wasting Away in Wrigleyville to tell us about their annual Pub Crawl, which is this upcoming Saturday, June 11th. &nbsp;Then he sticks around to discuss the topic given to us by Nick from Virgina about the idea of the Cubs signing Pujols. &nbsp;Kurt gives us his scary stat of the week and shares his concern that he might run out of material for this segment - not because the Cubs don't have scary stats, but because he's covered every aspect of the game. &nbsp;Then, to wrap things up, we read your photo caption contest entries.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, we will be giving two tickets to see Andre Dawson in Peoria at the Chiefs game on Saturday, June 11th. &nbsp;"Like" us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and on Tuesday, we'll announce how we will be giving those away.</p>
