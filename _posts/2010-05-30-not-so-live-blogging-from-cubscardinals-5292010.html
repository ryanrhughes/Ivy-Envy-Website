<p>If you attempted to follow the live blogging for yesterday's game, you noticed that:</p>
<p>1.  If you get up early enough on a Saturday morning, time plays tricks on you and you you head out the door 5 hours before you wake up.</p>
<p>2.  Live-blogging didn't work.  I don't <del datetime="2010-05-30T14:57:14+00:00">know</del> care why.&nbsp; But since we dedicated ourselves to it, I'll post it now.&nbsp; If you wonder what the "-C" means, we had decided to be clear who was tweeting what, but we weren't real consistent with it.</p>
<p>Part of the purpose of this trip was for both of us to experience the Wrigley bleachers for the first time.&nbsp; There has been discussion on blogs/Twitter about the conduct of fans in the bleachers and rather than blindly pass judgment, we decided that it is our duty as bloggers (a "profession" that requires no dedication to truth or fact) to experience this location first-hand.&nbsp; We may discuss our findings in a post or two, but for&nbsp; complete wrap-up, check out the next Ivy Envy Podcast episode.&nbsp; This episode will be different than the usual episodes.&nbsp; It will be a "backyard episode" in the vein of <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=964" target="_blank">Podcast #11</a>.&nbsp; If you haven't heard that episode, it's worth listening to.</p>
<p>It's going to be a warm Midwestern Memorial Day BBQ with nice cold beer on tap and the Cubs and Pirates on the television.&nbsp; That is a recipe for podcasting gold.&nbsp; We are going to open this episode to anyone that would like to be a guest and participate.&nbsp; If you're in the Quad Cities with no plans for Memorial day, get ahold of us to join us in person.</p>
<p>So, here is the live-blogging from yesterday's game.</p>
<p>6:14am - About to head to Wrigley. Had work people over last night and got about 4 hrs of sleep.  This is going to be a long day.</p>
<p>6:19am - Yes, we are aware that it's a little excessive to live only 2.5 hours from Chicago and leave at 6:30am for a 3pm game.</p>
<p>6:34am - Zune is loaded with two episodes of Planned Brotherhood for the trip today.  Best podcast out there.</p>
<p>10:25am - I believe we found free parking near Wrigley.  We'll know if it's free if the car hasn't been towed when we get back.</p>
<p>10:42am - I am thinking Lucky's for lunch.  I'll ignore the fact I feel like I could vomit any minute. -C</p>
<p>11:20am - Lucky's. -C <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitpic.com/1s6h8p" target="_blank">http://twitpic.com/1s6h8p</a></p>
<p>12:03pm - In line for the bleachers. I have a feeling this stuff isn't going through to the site.</p>
<p>12:50pm - Observation in the bleacher line - Cubs fans are laid back, Cards fans have a chip on their shoulders. -C</p>
<p>1:19pm - Fukudome BP - C <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitpic.com/1s7g6b" target="_blank">http://twitpic.com/1s7g6b</a></p>
<p>1:20pm - Here we are at beautiful Wrigley Field--just in time for BP.</p>
<p>1:46pm - Things are hot and mellow in the bleachers. -C</p>
<p>2:00pm - Received word from Mrs. Ivy Envy that live-blogging to the site isn't working. Hard to repair that from CF bleachers.</p>
<p>2:03pm - There should be a sign out here: "Don't jump for a ball hit in BP when you have a beer in your hand".  Seems simple to me.</p>
<p>2:53pm - Silva long-tossing.  -C <a rel="nofollow" href="http://twitpic.com/1s870t" target="_blank">http://twitpic.com/1s870t</a></p>
<p>2:53pm - Sweat is pouring, sun is burning.  -C</p>
<p>3:44pm - Bleacher conduct update - So far, Cardinals fans far more obnoxious.  Additional info - they are wearing visors.</p>
<p>4:29pm - 2 triples for Font. Cardinals fans in bleachers are no longer bragging about their pitcher's 0.00ERA. Cubs up 3-0.</p>
<p>4:30pm - I always wondered "Is it hot in the bleachers at Wrigley?" Now I know.</p>
<p>4:36pm - Won't use names and jinx, but the fat man on the hill is tearing it up.</p>
<p>4:41pm - I believe Silva just set career high in K's.  We have witnessed history.</p>
<p>4:44pm - Silva's made history.  Where were you when?</p>
<p>5:33pm - Fight down the left field line in the 7th.  Still calm in the bleachers.</p>
<p>5:34pm - Howry coming in for the 9th.</p>
<p>5:34pm - Stevens, rather.</p>
<p>5:38pm - Hmm, suddenly the Cardinals fans have disappeared from the bleachers.</p>
<p>5:39pm - Conversation behind me - "who was the starter today?" "Silvia"</p>
<p>7:00pm - At D'agostino's, waiting to meet up with John From WAIW/Exile on Clark. - C</p>
<p>7:03pm - Ready to watch the Blackhawks.</p>
