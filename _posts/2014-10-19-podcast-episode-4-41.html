Welcome to the 278<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast. </p>
<p>It's been a fairly quiet off-season for Cubs fans, so far.  With baseball still being played, the free agent market hasn't taken off yet.  The Cubs held a season ticket-holders meeting and we talk about the topics that were brought up, by the Cubs and the fans in attendance.  </p>
<p>The Arizona Fall League is underway and the Cubs have a handful of players participating.  Although the "small sample size" disclaimer applies to the stats right now, we look at how the players are doing for the Mesa Solar Sox.  </p>
<p>We go through this week's listener questions and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
