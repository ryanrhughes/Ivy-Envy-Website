  content: I might be interested in Z if I were a small market team.  I think it might
    be worth the risk for a team like the Royals.  They would get a pitcher with a
    lot of upside, and the Cubs would still be paying some of the contract.

<p>With the massive changes to the Cubs front office this off-season, there are many story-lines that will make the next few months pretty entertaining for Cubs fans. &nbsp;Of course, the manager search is in the forefront. &nbsp;It appears that the interview process is ending with Sandy Alomar Jr and he will be in competition with Mike Maddux, Dale Sveum and Pete Mackanin for the position. &nbsp;There is, of course, the usual free agency wheeling and dealing that typically occupies us in the winter months. &nbsp;This year, Cubs fans are probably keeping a closer watch on the moves, given that Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer are at the helm. &nbsp;I personally don't expect the Cubs to make any huge splashes with the free agents, but I think we'll see smarter contracts with the moves they do make. &nbsp;That's a win in my book.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting story lines to follow is Carlos Zambrano. &nbsp;I bet you've never heard that sentence before, have you? &nbsp;Over the last number of years, depending on the day and who you read/listen to, &nbsp;Big Z has either been the biggest asset or the biggest problem on the Cubs. &nbsp;He is the official enigma of the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Two months ago, I would have put big money on Zambrano never throwing a pitch for the Cubs again. &nbsp;Now, I'm not so sure. &nbsp;While Zambrano is pitching in the Venezuelan Winter League, Epstein is probably gathering information and coming up with a plan. &nbsp;Epstein had been in his position for just a few days and he was already speaking with Zambrano's agent and people within the organization that were familiar with Zambrano. &nbsp;MLB Trade Rumors <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2011/11/epstein-zambrano-touch-base.html" target="_blank">has reported </a>that Zambrano &nbsp;has received a "friendly" phone call from Epstein and the two will meet in person. &nbsp;Notice that the Venezuelan reporter that got the information from Carlos Zambrano is also named Carlos Zambrano. &nbsp;Sounds a little fishy to me.</p>
<p>Given Epstein's apparent desire to chart his own path with the Cubs, I think there's a good chance that Zambrano will be back with the Cubs in 2012. &nbsp;Epstein does not seem to feel any obligation to continue in the direction that Jim Hendry was headed. &nbsp;He's put in "his guys" and is determined to come to his own conclusions with players and personnel. &nbsp;Because of this, I expect him to give Zambrano the opportunity to prove himself and make his case to stay in Chicago. &nbsp;But at the same time, I believe Epstein will look at all of the factors and make a decision on the situation with the organization in mind.</p>
<p>On a side-note, on the most recent podcast episode, we joked about the story on ESPN.com&nbsp;entitled <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/7208874/gm-dayton-moore-kansas-city-royals-be-interested-carlos-zambrano-trade" target="_blank">"Royals Open to Zambrano Deal"</a>. &nbsp;If you read the article, you find out that the Royals GM, Dayton Moore, simply said that he would be interested in Zambrano if the Cubs were willing to give him away. &nbsp;That was a comment that probably could have been allowed to pass without ESPN acting like the Cubs and Royals are ready to hash this thing out.</p>
<p>I expected that story to fade away pretty quickly, but in an article on CSNChicago.com, Scott Krinch writes</p>
<blockquote><p>"With the rumor mill churning this offseason, the two teams that have shown the most interest in Zambrano are the Marlins and Royals.</blockquote><br />
Curious if anything more has been mentioned by the Royals, I looked into it and it doesn't appear there is any new information, which means there is no reason to believe the Royals are actually interested in Zambrano.</p>
<p>There has been talk of Zambrano joining Ozzie Guillen in Miami. &nbsp;Albert Pujols not only visited the Marlins, but was offered a contract from them. &nbsp;While I hadn't heard anything specific about interest between the Marlins and Zambrano, I thought maybe I had just missed it. &nbsp;I was only able to find one recent article on Zambrano and the Marlins. &nbsp;It was a report from Buster Olney that there <a href="http://www.rotoworld.com/content/playerpages/playerbreakingnews.asp?sport=MLB&amp;id=3106&amp;line=344462&amp;spln=1" target="_blank">"isn't a lot of favor"</a>&nbsp;within the Marlins organization for Zambrano.</p>
<p>I guess it just goes to show how little information is actually needed in the free agent rumor-mill.</p>
