    opportunity over the other option, Chris [&#8230;]"

<p>When pitchers and catchers reported to Spring Training, we knew right away that the starting rotation for the Cubs was going to be impacted by injury.  We immediately learned that Jake Arrieta would not be ready for the start of the season after experiencing a sore shoulder over the winter.   At this point, it looks like Arrieta will miss the first few weeks of the season.  My hunch is that the Cubs will play it safe, he'll get a start or two in Iowa and we'll see him at the end of April.  With the bullpen depth being the Cubs have this season, the team has some options with replacing Arrieta in the 5<sup>th</sup> starter spot.</p>
<p></script>It appeared that <strong>James McDonald</strong> was the front-runner to fill in for Arrieta.  I had hoped that McDonald could take advantage of this situation, but he did everything but that very thing.  McDonald has struggled greatly in Spring Training, posting a 12.71 ERA in 5<sup>2/3</sup> innings of work.  McDonald's inability to find the strike zone has been the issue.  He's allowed 9 walks and has not recorded a strikeout.  According to MLB.com, he's thrown 94 pitches and just 38 were strikes.  In his last outing, McDonald lasted just two pitches before being pulled from the game with a "shoulder issue".  This raises a red flag as McDonald missed the last 5 months of the 2013 season with the Pirates because of his shoulder.  So, I can't see McDonald being in the mix for the Cubs 5<sup>th</sup> starter spot.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Rusin</strong> has been used in this role by the Cubs for the last few years.  Between 2012 and 2013, Rusin has 20 starts for the big league club.  Rusin would be an adequate short-term replacement for Arrieta, but I don't think this will happen.  Rusin also has options remaining, so I believe he will start 2014 in Iowa.  We'll see Rusin this year, but I don't think it'll be until there is a more long-term injury or one of the starters is traded.  </p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Carlos+Villanueva+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+QrCBCQ48G0Hl.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/Carlos+Villanueva+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+QrCBCQ48G0Hl-230x300.jpg" alt="Carlos Villanueva" width="230" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9201" /></a>I believe <strong>Carlos Villanueva</strong> will be the fill-in for the Cubs 5<sup>th</sup> starter spot.  We saw Villanueva serve in this role in 2013, starting 15 games.  The idea that he is fighting for that spot was surely on his mind last night as he took the mound against the Rockies.  Although he gave up 3 runs, they came from a bad pitch to Carlos Gonzalez that resulted in a 3-run home run.  Otherwise, Villanueva looked sharp and hit his spots.  In his 4 innings of work, he gave up 3 hits, struck out 8 and walked 1.  Giving Villanueva the Cubs 5th starter spot would give the organization an opportunity to showcase him as he will surely be on the trading block as he's in the 2<sup>nd</sup> year of his 2-year contract.  </p>
<p>The Cubs still have some time to figure out what they will do with the #5 starter spot.  I think they should give it to Villanueva and although he has historically pitched better as a reliever, a team in need of a back-end starter would certainly look at him.  </p>
