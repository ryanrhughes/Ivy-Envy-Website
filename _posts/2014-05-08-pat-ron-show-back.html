  content: 'I REALLY thought that Zonk would have taken "Starling" with him when he
    left, but, sadly Coomer is still using that name far too often. &nbsp;Dave E&nbsp;@
    WGN just needs to set a policy: "Ron Coomer will donate $50 to JDRF every time
    Ron refers to Castro as Starling." While I have serious issues with Castro''s
    defense, he needs to have his name pronounced correctly.'

<p>Broadcasters have a truly difficult task of delivering play by play and analysis to the layman in layman&rsquo;s terms. After that, they still need to add insight and understanding to the person who considers himself or herself an "expert."</p>
<p>They serve as our eyes and ears during a baseball game, and the good ones can hit a few more senses.</p>
<p>We need broadcasters, both on radio and TV. And just in case you don&rsquo;t think so, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5906858">take this amazing failure of an experiment</a>&nbsp;from 33 years ago.</p>
<p>The problem with needing them is that you sometimes end up with Ken "Hawk" Harrelson, who has a <a href="http://www.heavethehawk.com">website dedicated to seeing he relinquishes the mic</a>.</p>
<p>And rarely, do you get <a href="http://officialvinscully.com">someone you&rsquo;d be happy to hear read the dictionary aloud</a>.</p>

<p>So, mostly you&rsquo;re stuck with someone in the middle, which begs a simple question: What do you want in a broadcaster?</p>
<p>For me, loving a broadcaster boils down to likability with a potential for memorability wrapped inside a general knowledge of the game. A broadcaster must be interesting &mdash; not self-interested.</p>
<p>What we&rsquo;re talking about here is the dirty little secret behind all platforms&nbsp;of sports media. While the news section demands objectivity (or so people think), sports writing and sports broadcasting is a performance.</p>
<p>And like the best actors, the best sports people build a bond with the audience because they speak <em>to</em> them not <em>at</em> them. Cockiness is annoying.</p>
<p>We loved Harry Caray because he was a fan of the game, said names backwards and knew how to play the naive role. He was a showman and one with no pretension.</p>
<p>We loved Ron Santo because he, too, was a fan, and he was genuine &mdash; and perhaps more&nbsp;genuinely confused than Harry played.</p>
<p>All of this build-up is to simply say that Coomer is a nice addition to the Cubs radio booth.</p>
<p>Coomer did very little to stand out as a Chicago Cubs utility player in 2001 &mdash; or his entire career, for that matter &mdash; so it makes me smile when Pat Hughes introduces him as "former all-star Ron Coomer" like he used to intro Ron Santo as a "nine-time all star and five-time Gold Glove winner."</p>
<p>But what Coomer lacks in accolades from his playing days he makes up for in realness. Fans want a person they feel like they can identify with.</p>
<p>Keith Moreland simply didn&rsquo;t have that, which proves to me that experience behind the mic doesn&rsquo;t matter much. "Zonk" spent 16 years calling college baseball before he joined the Cubs in 2011 only to leave after two seasons. The official word was that he <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article/chc/cubs-wgn-radio-analyst-keith-moreland-steps-down?ymd=20131106&amp;content_id=63731926&amp;vkey=news_chc">left to spend more time with family</a>. And who am I to suspect otherwise? But&hellip; you know&hellip;</p>
<p>Moreland knew the game, indeed. But he didn&rsquo;t fit well next to Hughes. Pat plays the straight man and his sidekick the cutup.</p>
<p>But when the sidekick forgets who really runs the show, it gets awkward.</p>
<p>Coomer brings a perfect mixture of knowledge, affability and simplicity. He understands his role and plays it well. His somewhat unrefined half-laughing delivery and nervous chuckles will sharpen as the two men in the booth learn each other's timing.</p>
<p>The "Pat and Ron Show" is back and with a Ron as equally jolly as the last. Simply to hear Pat say, "Pat and Ron," is nostalgic and familiar. I like it.</p>
<p>Now if we can only loosen up J.D. a little bit.</p>
