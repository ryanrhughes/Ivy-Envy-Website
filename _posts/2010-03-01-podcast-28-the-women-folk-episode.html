<p>Corey, Andy and Kurt finally build up the guts to allow our wives and fiance on the podcast to talk about the Cubs with us.  We learn how they really feel about the Cubs.  The girls also get honest about our obsession with the Cubs and the time to we dedicate to Ivy Envy.  They are then subjected to a pop quiz that consist of general baseball and Cubs-specific questions.</p>
