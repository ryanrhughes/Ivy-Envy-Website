  content: WSCR is White Sox oriented? Oh pa-lease. How can anything in a "Cubs town"
    be considered White Sox oriented? Blowhard and Boring may banter, but I'll take
    Danny Mac and his "Superfans"-like, phony voice than that old goat Mike Murphy
    and his "we all got an agenda" crap. I LOVE when Terry impersonates him, though.
    Whaaaaaa aaaaa didjagetthat Jerome? ahhhhhhh. alll Andy MacF-A-I-L ahhhhhhh, see?
    that's a good bit ahhh.

  content: "WSCR is the flagship station of the White Sox...so yeah, it's White Sox
    oriented.  Interesting that the first comment on this post is almost 2 years after
    it was written.  In the last 2 years, I have scaled back my WSCR listening to...maybe
    once every month.  \r\n\r\nCan't stand Danny Mac and Boors and Bernstein are un-listenable.
    \ I have to clean up the arrogance that seeps out of the speakers in my car when
    I listen to B&B and that gets old."

  content: "If I can compare WGN, which is cubs oriented, they rarely if ever talk
    about the White Sox, right? WSCR is supposedly the White Sox flagship station
    and they cover both teams pretty equally, but for a White Sox flagship station???
    Again, it's not \"White Sox oriented\" if it has a cubs majority. Just cause you
    name something as such doesn't make it so, bro.\r\n\r\nYeah, I listen to WSCR
    and am really glad to see Murph off the air, hopefully for good. He was bad for
    baseball and bad for Chicago. He started more animosity between fans than promoting
    objective dialogue. With his whole hokey bit--I think he moved here at 18 or so
    from Iowa, Indiana, or downstate Illinois. He was disrespectful to his callers,
    especially White Sox callers, but not as bad as Blowhard and Boring. I wish everybody
    on the Score would stop trying to be Howard Stern and stick to the hot sports
    talk! :-) \r\n\r\nStill, the last straw came when he did \"Sports Spurts\" and
    started spitting into the microphone. Probably the worst hour or radio ever and
    made we want to wait for Murph outside the studio just to punch his face (it was
    a thought, though). Not sure why Murph cant get a job on WGN. That would seem
    a match made in heaven. I wonder what's WGN's problem *giggle*"

<p>I flipped on The Score today to listen to Murph get the wheels of the Crosstown Series rolling.&nbsp; Instead I heard "The Danny Mac" show, hosted by Dan McNeil.&nbsp; I am not familiar with him, but apparently he's been around in Chicago sports talk for a while.</p>
<p>I've always had mixed feelings about Murph.&nbsp; I can't stand all the in-show plugs and advertisements.&nbsp; I haven't liked his tendency to pick one Cubs player and just rail on him until he's run out of town.&nbsp; He did this to Jacque Jones and I feel that without Jacque, the Cubs wouldn't have been in the 2007 playoffs.&nbsp; He also seemed a little off-kilter.&nbsp; He sounded and spoke like he was much older than he actually is.&nbsp; He sounded uneducated, but that was nice considering he was right before Boors and Bernstein and their always-enlarging egos and inside jokes.&nbsp; Overall though, it was a tough show to listen to. I won't miss the Brown's Chicken and Rental Max plugs.</p>
<p>There were some moments that I really enjoyed in the Mike Murphy show.&nbsp; John Dewan, in my opinion, provided some of the most interesting sports talk I've ever heard.&nbsp; Most importantly, he was a guy that I knew I could flip on for some Cubs talk.&nbsp; The Score has increasingly become White Sox oriented, especially since they started broadcasting White Sox games.&nbsp; Murph wasn't, at all, what I wanted out of a radio show, but he offered more Cubs talk than anyone else and I appreciated that.</p>
