Kyle Schwarber was the Cubs 1st round selection (4th overall) in the 2014 MLB Draft.  I had the opportunity speak with Schwarber last week when the Kane County Cougars visited the Quad Cities River Bandits.</p>
<p>Schwarber has since been promoted to High-A Daytona.  Considered the best college bat in the draft, he quickly demonstrated that he was prepared for competition greater than he faced with Boise and Kane County.  </p>
<p>In the interview, Schwarber talks about his draft day experience, a possible future position change and how it feels to be part of this young and exciting Cubs system.  </p>
