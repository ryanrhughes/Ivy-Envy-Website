<p>I'm going to look past Mark Derosa's great performance last night in San Francisco and instead focus on the accomplishments of my favorite Chicago Cub:</p>

<p>Matt Murton has continued to work through his season-long extra-base dryspell and busted out with <a id="more"></a><a id="more-113"></a>two doubles last night.&nbsp; Murton went 2-4 with 2 doubles and 2 RBI.&nbsp; He also quietly raised his batting average up 36 points.&nbsp; Now, I don't want to sound really pathetic, but he also had a monstrous foul-ball that went just foul.&nbsp; But this thing cleared the foul pole.&nbsp; We're talking upper-deck foul by a few feet.</p>
<p>I realize Murton is probably trade bait at this point, so I feel like I owe it to him to sing his praises while he still wears Cubbie Blue.&nbsp;</p>
