<p>Andy and Corey welcome regular guest, Matt Veto to the podcast to discuss Lou Piniella moving Carlos Zambrano to the bullpen.  Veto references his column in the Dispatch/Argus on this topic and you can <a href="http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=489882&amp;query=matt%20veto" target="_blank">find it here</a>.  We also read some reader/listener feelings on the topic.  The reign of Milton Bradley as the Asshat of the Week continues.</p>
<p>Join us at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline this Monday for a live podcast recording and game-watch.  We will have some Cubs stuff from Budweiser to give away and Twenty will have $2 Bud and Bud Light pints for the event.  Come on down, hang out and root on the boys in blue as they take on the Washington Nationals.</p>
