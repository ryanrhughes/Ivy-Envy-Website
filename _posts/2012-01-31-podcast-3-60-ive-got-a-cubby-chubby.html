<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey through Skype for this episode.  Spring Training is right around the corner and Tim Sheridan's blog post over at <a href="http://boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a> gets our juices flowing for Spring baseball.  Tim listens to Dale Sveum address some of the youngsters of the organization and we discuss if his statements are worth getting excited about.  </p>
<p>The Cubs did make one move in the last week, signing Trever Miller.  Andy talks about some of the chatter on message boards about the "trash heap" and Corey will frighten you with naming the player that is the third most similar to Miller.  In other pitching news, the Cubs are considering signing Todd Coffey.  This potential move gets the green light from Andy.  </p>
<p>Then we look at some of the topics that listeners tossed our way, including: Red Sox compensation, the pitching rotation, Back to the Future II and the idea of the Cubs sacrificing things and making massive changes in trade for winning.  </p>
<p>We finish the show off by picking a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  Congrats to Brenton, you win nothing....er...bragging rights.  </p>
