<p>Well the Cubs looked like they were in a great position to grab another series victory against the Phillies, but they failed offensively in the final two games and only managed to split.&nbsp; My favorite part of today's game was Sean Marshall showing bunt, pulling it back, and hitting a single to center field.&nbsp; Other than that I could have done without all the clutch failure and stranded base runners.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-208"></a></p>
<p>September looks to be an exciting month for the Cubs.&nbsp; They play 25 more games, 12 of which are against the Cards and the Brewers.&nbsp; Though the Cards are all but out of contention, it will still be cool to see those two teams face off in September.</p>
