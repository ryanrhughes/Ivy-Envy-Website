<p>We have an interview episode for you this week on the podcast. Harry Pavlidis joins me to talk about pitch framing.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/01/castillo-e1420394377731.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10732" src="/uploads/2015/01/castillo-e1420394377731-300x211.gif" alt="castillo" width="300" height="211" data-id="10732" /></a>With the addition of Miguel Montero and the seemingly inevitable departure of Welington Castillo, it&rsquo;s obvious that pitch framing is important to this front office and there&rsquo;s nobody better to talk about pitch framing than Harry Pavlidis.</p>
<p>In this discussion we&rsquo;ll start at the basics&hellip;.what is pitch framing. We&rsquo;ll also talk about how this statitstic is measured, it&rsquo;s value and we&rsquo;ll talk about how good Miguel Montero is at it and how bad Welington Castillo is at it. And most importantly, what does the change from Montero to Castillo mean for the 2015 Cubs?</p>
