<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/louGiants.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3729 aligncenter" title="louGiants" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/louGiants.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="163" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lou Piniella signed a deal this week with the Giants to be a consultant. The <a title="Giants bring on Piniella as consultant" href="http://sanfrancisco.giants.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110202&amp;content_id=16553960&amp;vkey=news_sf&amp;c_id=sf" target="_blank">article</a> on Giants.com outlines one of the main duties of Lou's new gig as "scrutinizing the Giants on satellite television". Wow, I didn't realize you could get paid for that. This is good news for us at Ivy Envy. When we're in our late 60s we, too might make money from scrutinizing the Cubs on satellite television.</p><br />
Lou has also decided that should he ever return to the dugout and have the opportunity to wear the uniform again he's going to leave the sticker on his 59fifty and rock the flat bill.</p>
