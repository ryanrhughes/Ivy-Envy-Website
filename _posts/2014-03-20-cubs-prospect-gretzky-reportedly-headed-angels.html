<p>Just this morning, MiLB.com <a href="http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140320&content_id=69403418&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_milb" target="_blank">ran a story</a> on Cubs prospect, Trevor Gretzky.  Yes...THAT Gretzky, son of "The Great One."</p>
<p>Then this came across the Twitter stream from Dan Vogelbach:<br />
<center><br />
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Good luck to my boy <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevorGretzky">@TrevorGretzky</a> with the angels. Not going to be the same without u my man, gonna miss you for sure.</p>&mdash; Daniel Vogelbach (@Flowbro3) <a href="https://twitter.com/Flowbro3/statuses/446718191964667905">March 20, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>The only current news is that there is some weight behind the Vogelbach tweet (har har).  Patrick Mooney tweeted this:<br />

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>Source confirms <a href="https://twitter.com/Flowbro3">@Flowbro3</a> report: The Cubs have a minor deal in the works that would involve Trevor Gretzky going to the Angels.</p>&mdash; Patrick Mooney (@CSNMooney) <a href="https://twitter.com/CSNMooney/statuses/446729169871704064">March 20, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>Trevor Gretzky was drafted straight out of high school, in the 7<sup>th</sup> round of the 2011 draft.  The 21 year-old left fielder spent time with Boise and Kane County in 2013, batting .274/.300/.333 between the Northwest League and Midwest League.  </p>
<p>Gretzky would have probably started 2014 with Kane County, given he was with the Cougars only 14 games at the end of the 2014 season.  The Cubs are an organization that is sitting really well with positional prospects, so we can expect to see more of these moves.  If Gretzky has in fact been sent to the Angels, I'd guess the Cubs are getting pitching in return.  </p>

Thanks to Bill Shaikin of the LA Times, we know who the Cubs got in return for Trevor Gretzky.<br />

<p>Matt Scioscia is a 25 year-old 1<sup>st</sup> baseman out of the University of Notre Dame.  Essentially, this trade means nothing.  I think it grabbed our attention because we haven't seen the Cubs trade many minor league guys and perhaps we/I hoped Gretzky was part of a larger deal that would bring the Cubs some pitching.  Other than the notable last names, it's just a swap of players that will most likely not make it out of the minors.  </p>
