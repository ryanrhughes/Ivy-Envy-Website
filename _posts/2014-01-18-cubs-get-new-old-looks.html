  content: Is it me, or does the shield/badge on the '42 jersey say "health"?
    &nbsp;Is that a WWII thing or was this a little known physical fitness campaign?

     I did a little digging and found this: &nbsp;

    Wartime sleeve patches were worn by all levels of professional baseball teams between 1942 and 1945. A &ldquo;Health&rdquo; patch was worn during the 1942 season, part of a war-time health and fitness awareness campaign, and from 1943-1945 a &ldquo;Stars and Stripes&rdquo; was worn.

<p>At Cubs Convention this weekend, displayed are four of the Cubs throwback uniforms that the team will be wearing this season, and Carrie Muskat reported that the retro uniforms are "part of the Wrigley Field 100th anniversary celebration."&nbsp;&nbsp;The years represented in the image above (starting with the upper left and going clockwise) are 1942, 1953, 1929, and 1969. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though many fans are hoping and waiting for additions to the 2014 Cubs that are not superfluous to winning games (e.g., Clark), many do enjoy seeing the Cubs sporting a different look from time to time. &nbsp;Still, I imagine that this display will just be another ire-fomenting instance for the internet muscle flexers. &nbsp;It seems that the same people who want to see the Cubs adding impact players instead of adding stuff like Clark and retro uniforms are the same people who are decrying the potential signing of Tanaka, but I guess that is a digression.</p>
<p>As for the uniforms, I think I favor the '53 and the '69 the most. &nbsp;Though a pure-white look seems kind of boring, imagine the '53 jersey in the context of verdant green field/ivy and blue sky. &nbsp;Even though the Cubs went to the World Series in 1929, the "C" on that jersey just is evocative of the Reds for me, so I can't get behind it. &nbsp;One site that is great for browsing the various uniforms the Cubs (or any other team) have worn over the years is <a href="http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/index.htm">Dressed to the Nines</a>&nbsp;(curated by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum). &nbsp;Here is their image of the 1942 uniform:</p>
