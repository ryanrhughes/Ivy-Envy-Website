<p>Welcome to the First Annual Ivy Envy MLB Final Standings Challenge (IEMLBFSC).&nbsp; Some of us that write for Ivy Envy will be posting our predictions on what the standings will look like, come October.&nbsp; We encourage you to join in with us.&nbsp; Post your predictions in a comment to either this post or any of the posts of the writers' predictions.&nbsp; You know baseball as well, if not better, than we do.&nbsp; So why not show us up?&nbsp; If a non-Ivy Envy writer wins the contest, you will be awarded whatever Ivy Envy merchandise we have at that point.&nbsp; That merchandise is in the development stages and it will surely be available by then.</p>
<p>The IEMLBFSC will be scored in the following manner:</p>
<p>You will receive one point for each standing position you are off, with each team.&nbsp; For instance, if you chose the top of the NL Central to be:</p>
<p>1. Cubs&nbsp; 2. Brewers&nbsp; 3. Cardinals</p>
<p>Let's say the final standings end up:</p>
<p>1. Cardinals 2. Brewers 3. Cubs</p>
<p>You would get 2 points for the Cardinals, 0 points for the Brewers and 2 points for the Cubs.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the object is to have the lowest point total.</p>
<p>So list your standings for every division in baseball.&nbsp; It won't count for points, but go ahead and pick your wildcard teams and how you think the NLDS, NLCS, ALDS, ALCS and World Series will pan out, too.</p>
<p>Deadline for the contest is noon, Monday April 6th.</p>
