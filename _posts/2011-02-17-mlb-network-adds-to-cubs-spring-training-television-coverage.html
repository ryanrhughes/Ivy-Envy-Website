<p>The MLB Network has issued the schedule for their 2011 Spring Training coverage.  Three games that will not be available on WGN TV, Comcast SportsNet and ESPN will now be available to you, if you have the MLB Network.  In all, there are four Cubs games on the broadcast schedule.  The entire Chicago-based media schedule is <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3751" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The most notable Cubs game on the schedule is the  Friday, March 11th game versus the White Sox.   This game was previously only available through the "radio" broadcast on Cubs.com.</p>
<p>The remaining 3 games will be during our trip out to Mesa.  The 3/21 (Angels), 3/22 (Dodgers) and 3/25 (Mariners) games will all be on the MLB Network.  The Mariners game is the only one that was already scheduled to be televised.  WGN TV will be covering this game, as well.</p>
<p>Also, the Cubs episode of the network's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">30 Clubs in 30 Days</span> series will be taped at Hohokam on Thursday, March 10th and it will air on Friday, March 11th.</p>
