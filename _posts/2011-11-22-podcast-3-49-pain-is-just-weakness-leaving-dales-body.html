<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt look at the hiring of Dale Sveum (and his tattoos) and predict where the organization will be at the end of his 3-4 year contract.  We predict some of the difficulties that Sveum will face with this team in the state that it is currently in.  Rudy Jaramillo will be returning to the Cubs and we wonder what his effect was on the team in 2011.  </p>
<p>Matt Garza is reportedly on the trading block and we consider what effect this could have on the pitching staff.  Epstein and Hoyer are in the Dominican Republic to check out the Cuban defector, Yoennis Cespedes.  Carlos Zambrano takes a baseball to the face and our reporter in Venezuela remains silent.  </p>
<p>Have a Happy Thanksgiving and Stir-up Sunday!</p>
