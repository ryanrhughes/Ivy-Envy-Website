  content: Wow! The HOF just can't make up their mind can they? I can understand the
    reasoning behind his &amp; Larussa but what was the problem with Dawson, my favorite
    player growing up, wanting a Cubs logo but MLB "forced" an Expos logo? Maybe a
    good decision since a lot of players with be playing for multiple teams and it
    might be hard for one team to be chosen for the plaque unless it's completely
    clear what team should be chosen. For example, if and when, Todd Helton gets elected
    that would be clearly a Colorado Rockies logo.

  content: I say just leave it up to the player.  I don't know at all, but I wonder
    if the Dawson thing was kind of tossing those poor schmucks up north of the border
    (Ian from Montreal) a bone.

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/01/maddux.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8709" alt="Greg Maddux Hall of Fame" src="/uploads/2014/01/maddux-227x300.jpg" width="227" height="300" /></a>Greg Maddux and Tony LaRussa will both enter the Hall of Fame with no logos on the caps of their plaques. &nbsp;Like most Cubs fans, I expected Maddux to enter the Hall of Fame with an Atlanta Braves cap.</p>
<p>It was his years in Atlanta that put Maddux in the Hall. &nbsp;He is probably the most Hall of Fame worthy player of my lifetime and I consider myself lucky to have been able to see him pitch in a Cubs uniform.</p>
<p>I would assume that most Braves fans feel this is a slap in the face, and I think that it's a justified reaction. &nbsp;Then again, the fact that he didn't pitch all of those years on the North Side is a slap in the face for Cubs fans.</p>
<p>In an era of baseball that will always be tarnished, we will be able to show future generations some of Maddux's unbelievable statistics and tell them what it was like to watch him pitch, regardless of the uniform he wore.</p>
