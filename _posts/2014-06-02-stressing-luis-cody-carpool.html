<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Do you think the Cubs make sure Cody Ransom and Valbuena don&rsquo;t ride to the ballpark together in case there&rsquo;s an accident because then they&rsquo;d have to call up Ian Stewart?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a title="Podcast 5.14" href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-14-make-sure-valbuena-and-ransom-arent-in-the-same-car/" target="_blank"><em>Andy, Podcast 5.14</em></a></blockquote><br />
Let's look back about 11 months. In case you forgot, Ian Stewart had just been suspended for his Twitter tirade about the Cubs &ldquo;letting him rot in AAA&rdquo; and Dale Sveum not liking him. He was hitting .164 in AAA. He was right about one thing, he was rotting.</p>
<p>The Cubs were left with a Luis Valbuena/Cody Ransom platoon at third. Donnie Murphy was playing mostly shortstop in Iowa and wouldn&rsquo;t get to Chicago until August. The closest prospect, Christian Villanueva, was about three months in to his first year at AA Tennessee. Kris Bryant had just been drafted and wasn&rsquo;t even signed yet. He had yet to play a single game in the Cubs system. Matt Garza was still a Cub and Mike Olt was a Ranger (AAA Round Rock).</p>
<p>Third base was not a bright spot for the Cubs.</p>
<p><strong>June 2, 2014</strong></p>
<p>Luis Valbuena has the most tenure at the position and is off to a good start in 2014. This year's Valbuena is a much better version than last year's. He&rsquo;s a solid and versatile defender, has some power from the left side, a much improved approach, and is uncontested in the bat flip department. It should also be noted that he had only 10 MLB starts at 3B before joining the Cubs in 2012. He&rsquo;s platooning with Mike Olt whose vision issues seem to be a thing of the past. His average is not where it needs to be (.162), but all is forgiven when you hit 9 HR and 24 RBI before June. Many are clamoring for Olt to be the every day guy and do away with this platoon business. These two guys put you in a pretty good spot for a rebuilding team. A versatile veteran and a young guy with nothing but upside.</p>
<p>But there are still more pieces to this puzzle. Starting with Christian Villanueva, who the Cubs also <del>stole</del>&nbsp;acquired from the Rangers in the Dempster deal. He is the best defender in the group. Jason Parks ranked him as a top 100 prospect last year. After a full season at AAA he might be ready for a spot on a major league roster. And then there is Kris Bryant. No doubt you&rsquo;ve heard what kind of offensive season he&rsquo;s putting together (18 HR and 49 RBI in 55 games. This pace would get him to 53 in 162 games). He&rsquo;s screaming through the system and could&nbsp;hit AAA later this year, just over a year after being drafted. The Cubs don&rsquo;t seem to want to move him off third just yet even though that seems a likely move down the road. And to keep the heat on these guys there is switch-hitting Jemier Candelario who is off to a slow start in Daytona, but is a top ten prospect for the Cubs.</p>
<p>This is how quickly things can change. No long-term, high-dollar, free agent contracts were signed. The Mets will pay David Wright $138 million, not the Cubs. This is how &ldquo;assets are acquired&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t turn the Rangers away when they offered Mike Olt as part of the Garza deal when they had just acquired Christian Villanueva in 2012 and drafted Kris Bryant. They simply acquired the best talent available.</p>
<p>Less than a year from Ian Stewart tweeting himself off the team, the Cubs are bursting with options at third base. They won&rsquo;t all be Cubs for the long haul, but they will serve to make this team better down the road. The business of baseball requires treating players as commodities, which isn&rsquo;t always fun for the fans. So, for the time being, my advice is don't get too attached to anyone, especially Jason Hammel. Be thankful we no longer have to deal with the potential hazards of a Luis and Cody car pool.</p>
