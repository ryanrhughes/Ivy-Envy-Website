<p style="text-align: left;">The long winter months have passed and the season of Spring can officially begin because Opening Day is here.&nbsp; Forget about last year's frustrations and this year's expectations.&nbsp; It's baseball, just enjoy it.&nbsp; Crack open a cold one and wait until Wednesday to live and die with every game, critique every mis-play and question every move.&nbsp; There will be 161 opportunities for that other stuff.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Go Cubs.</p></p>
