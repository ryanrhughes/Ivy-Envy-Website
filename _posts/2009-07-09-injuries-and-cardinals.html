  content: 2-2 ain't bad.. I really wanted 3-1 but I'll take a split with the way
    the cubs have been playing the past few weeks.. hopefully, with exactly one (1)
    Cub making an appearance at the all star game, it'll give our boys some R&amp;R
    and get back to the form we all know they can play at..

<p>There is a lot going on with the Cubs right now.&nbsp; One of the most pressing issues is the burgeoning injury list.&nbsp; We were so relieved and happy to be injury-free at the beginning of the regular season.&nbsp; Do you see what happens, little Larry?&nbsp; It would have been better to get it out our system then.&nbsp; This business about Ryan Dempster's toe is just about as frustrating as <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=153" target="_blank">Kerry Wood's Nintendo finger</a> from last season.&nbsp; However, Dempster hasn't seemed extraordinarly sharp this season anyway.&nbsp; Thankfully we have some good young pitchers showing up at the right time.&nbsp; More annoying to me is Soto's oblique strain.&nbsp; This is happening right when he is swinging the bat well and getting a good rhythm going.&nbsp; Hopefully he can find that right away again after a little time off.</p>
<p>This upcoming series against the Cardinals is pretty important.&nbsp; The Cubs have the chance to put themselves in a great position going into the All-Star Break.&nbsp; They also could really bury themselves with some losses.&nbsp; It will be interesting to see if Harden can bounce back and have a great outing tomorrow.&nbsp; He needs to.&nbsp; The Cubs will be facing Chris Carpenter, and hopefully they can support Harden offensively.&nbsp; Saturday's game looks to be very winnable; the Cubs will be facing Brad Thompson, and he seems to be quite hittable (2-5/ 4.92 ERA).&nbsp; At least there aren't any ridiculous neon signs at Wrigley for Pujols to break.</p>
<p>In sad news, Freel and Farney are no longer with the team.&nbsp; At least Freel can now use the "royal we" and be referring to someone besides himself.</p>
