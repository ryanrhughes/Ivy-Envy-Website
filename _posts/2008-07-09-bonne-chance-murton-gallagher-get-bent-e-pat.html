  In a move designed to keep all <a href="http://www.bugeaters.com" target="_blank">bugeaters</a> in Nebraska and California, the Cubs have shipped Sean Gallagher, Matt Murton, Eric Patterson, and Josh Donaldson off to Oakland for Rich Harden and Chad Gaudin.

  Either someone at MLB.com is a Photoshop champ, or Gallagher's "bring me a bowl of Life Cereal" grin was no one-time fluke occurrence.&nbsp; But Life is not the only thing Gallagher likes to ingest, apparently.&nbsp; <em>The Sun-Times</em>' <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/1043756,CST-SPT-csep08.article" target="_blank">website</a> reports that "Derrek Lee spotted a bug in his locker Saturday in St. Louis, [and] Gallagher ate it for an undisclosed sum of cash -- to the disgust and delight of Lee and teammate Reed Johnson."&nbsp; However, despite Gallagher's billygoat-esque stance toward eating, I wish he was still a Cub.&nbsp; I don't feel that his numbers this year reflected his potential as a pitcher (3-4 4.45 era); some of his starts did feature anemic offense from the Cubs.

  I'll leave the Matt Murton farewell post up to Corey, but Daft Funk of <a href="http://thundermatt.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Matt's Saloon</a> had this Lebowski pastiche for Murton's departure:

<p>I'll leave the Matt Murton farewell post up to Corey, but Daft Funk of <a href="http://thundermatt.com/" target="_blank">Thunder Matt's Saloon</a> had this Lebowski pastiche for Murton's departure:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-122"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>"Thunder Matt was a good baseball player and a good man. He was one of us. He was a man who loved the outfield...and bowling, and as an outfielder he explored the right fields of the National League, from Wrigley to Coors Field and...up to...Pittsburgh. He was traded, like so many young men of his generation, he was traded before his time. In your wisdom, Lord, you took him, as you took so many bright flowering young men at <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Khe</span> <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Sanh</span>, at <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Langdok</span>, at Hill 364. These young men gave their lives. And so would Thunder Matt. Thunder, who loved baseball. And so, Matthew Henry "Thunder" <span class="blsp-spelling-error">Murton</span>, in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been, we commit your final mortal remains to the bosom of Oakland, which you loved so well."</blockquote><br />
So, in closing, I am a fan of the trade the Cubs made, but I will miss Murton and Gallagher.</p>
<p>P.S. Thunder Matt's Saloon also made me aware of the existence of this incredible baseball card:</p>

<p>(Johnstone was a career .267 hitter during his 23 season MLB career.&nbsp; He played for the Cubs from '82-'84, and he also had keen fashion sensibilities.)</p>
