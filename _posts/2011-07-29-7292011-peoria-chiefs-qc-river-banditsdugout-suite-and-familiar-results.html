  content: It was a pleasure meeting you, Corey. It's too bad we couldn't watch a
    Chiefs win last night, but as you noted, the blown save was a sight all too familiar
    to us Cubs fans, as was the Chiefs' inability to take advantage of multiple scoring
    opportunities. Eric Jokisch deserved to win that game.

  content: As well as Jokisch pitched, I was very surprised by his lack of velocity.
    Andy pointed it out during the game. Looked like he topped out in the mid 80s.
    He changed speed well, but I wonder how that fastball will hold up as he moves
    through the ranks.

<p>Last night was our evening in the dugout suite at Modern Woodmen Park to watch the Cubs of the future, the Peoria Chiefs, take on our hometown Quad Cities River Bandits (Cardinals affiliate). It's always a good crowd when the Chiefs come to town because the Cubs fans come out and root for the <del datetime="2011-07-29T13:17:50+00:00">boys</del> kids in blue.</p>
<p>Before the game, I had the pleasure of meeting and interviewing Craig Wieczorkiewicz, the man known as the <a href="http://www.mwltraveler.com" target="_blank">Midwest League Traveler</a>. That audio interview will be posted in our podcast feed and here on the site early next week.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it may not have been a great idea to schedule a road trip to Milwaukee for the Cubs/Brewers game and then enjoy the Thirst Thursday $2 beers at Modern Woodmen Park the next night. &nbsp;I really have to hand it to my wife for muscling it out through these two days. &nbsp;She worked two full days and took in two baseball games while sleeping just 3 hours from 5am Wednesday until 11pm Thursday. &nbsp;That's 42 hours with two baseball games, tailgating, 415 miles in the car, and a lot of sweating. &nbsp;She's a keeper.</p>
<p>The dugout suite at Modern Woodmen Park is definitely a nice vantage point from which to watch a game. &nbsp;Part of the appeal of the dugout suite is that you are essentially attached to the visitor's dugout, so we were right there next to the Chiefs.</p>

<br><br />
If you read my <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5728" target="_blank">post on the site</a> offering seats in the dugout suite with us, or if you listened to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5766" target="_blank">the last podcast episode</a>, you'll remember that it was "Used Car Giveaway Night", sponsored by Reynold's Ford (home of the deal-makers).  I had predicted that they would be giving away in 1985 Mercury Grand Marquis.  As it turned out, Reynolds Ford and the Bandits gave away five (very) used vehicles and sure enough, one of them was a Mercury Grand Marquis.  This one was a spiffy 1991 model with a little rust.  </p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MercGrandMarquis.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/MercGrandMarquis-224x300.jpg" alt="" title="MercGrandMarquis" width="224" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5836" /></a></center></p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the 12 of us in the dugout suite won any of the five vehicles given away.  I had my heart set on the Merc, but left disappointed.  </p>
<p>There's no rhyme or reason to us choosing our favorite minor league players.  Last year, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2672" target="_blank">we became big Ronny Morla fans</a> for no other reason that he was warming up in the bullpen right next to us when the $2 beers began to kick in.  Our new favorite Chiefs player is Taiwan Easterling, mainly because of his name.  Taiwan must have been feeling the good vibes from us in the dugout suite because he had a great game.  He went 2-3 on the evening with a sacrifice fly, which ended up being the only run the Chiefs scored in the game.  Easterling is very speedy, and it's good to see some speed in the Cubs' minor league system, considering the lack of speed we have seen with the big league team in the last few years.  He was thrown out at 3rd, trying to stretch a double into a triple, but his speed on the play was impressive.  In his 10 games with the Chiefs, Easterling is leading the Chiefs in batting average (.324) and OPS (.906).  </p>
<p>Rubi Silva had a great game at the plate, as well.  Silva went 4-4 and raised his batting average to .279.  The former member of the Cuban Junior National team was signed by the Cubs in January.  Silva is 22 years old and started the season in Peoria.  He was promoted to Daytona and played 29 games before he was sent back to Peoria.  </p>
<p>Eric Jokisch was the starting pitcher for the Chiefs and held the Bandits scoreless through 6 2/3 innings, giving up just four hits and one walk while striking out seven.  Jokisch has pitched very well for the Chiefs this season and seems to be getting stronger as the season progresses.  While the Chiefs are only 10-22 in the 2nd half of the season, this was Jokisch's fourth quality start in that stretch.  In his five July starts, he has struck out 28 and walked just two.  </p>
<p>Alvaro Sosa was able to keep the Bandits off the board, despite issuing two walks in his 2/3 inning of work.  The game went to the bottom of the 9th with the Chiefs leading 1-0.  If you've watched how the big league club has played this year and knew that the Chiefs have lost 20 games in their opponents' final at-bat this season, you had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen.  </p>
<p>Yohan Gonzalez came in to close the game for the Chiefs and just looked awful.  Gonzalez couldn't find the strike zone and walked the lead-off batter in four pitches.  The Bandits sent in pinch-runner Kolton Wong (more on him later).  With Wong running, Colin Walsh got a hit and that put runners on the corners with no outs.  Gonzalez threw a wild pitch and Wong came home to score, tying the game with still no outs.  Jonathan Rodriguez came to the plate for the Bandits and absolutely crushed a 2-1 Gonzalez pitch.  I have no idea how far this ball flew, but it left the ballpark and I don't think anyone hit one that far in the Midwest League Homerun Derby this year.  The Bandits celebrated the walk-off 3-1 win and from our seats next to the dugout, it was easy to see the disappointment on the faces of the Chiefs, some of them staying in the dugout to watch the celebration.  </p>
<p>As I said, this is a familiar scene for the Chiefs.  The Chiefs have more blown saves (16) than saves (15) in 2011.  Gonzalez has been especially bad, blowing six of his eight save opportunities.  Jokisch has had three wins wasted by the bullpen, just in the month of July.  The offense hasn't helped Jokisch either.  The offense has only given him five runs of support in his last six starts.  </p>
<p>Overall, it was a game that us Cubs fans are used to watching.  The Chiefs had 12 hits, but only hit 2-9 with runners in scoring position and managed just one run.  Then the bullpen came in and blew a great starting pitching performance.  </p>
<p>I mentioned Kolton Wong earlier.  I think the Bandits might want to reconsider their marketing strategy with Wong.<br />

<p>It was a hot/humid and sweaty night with no air movement at Modern Woodmen Park and we weren't too happy with the results of the game.  However, Andy, Kurt and I had a great time with our families and friends in the dugout suite.  The dugout suite is a great view of the field and it was interesting to watch the activities in the Chiefs dugout.  Andy was even able to "exchange pleasantries" with Elliot Soto while he was on-deck during a pitching change.  It was a great vantage point and I think we'll probably make this an annual event.  </p>
