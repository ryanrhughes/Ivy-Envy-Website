  content: Just listened to the podcast and wanted to comment regarding David Ross.  I
    heard an interview with Rizzo where he was asked if there was a guy in the clubhouse
    that everyone looked up to.  Rizzo said, without a doubt, it was David Ross.  He
    said if Ross was talking, everyone was listening.  Makes me feel better to remember
    that every time he comes to the plate.

  content: I really enjoy your podcast. I'd like to hear an epidode dedicated to the
    minors and future moves you think will happen especially post draft. How long
    until Schwarber and Vogelbach are in Iowa?  Who gets moved/traded?  With so
    much focus on hitters, what is the status of the arms in the system?  You guys
    give great opinions and I really enjoy your fan approach.

Late last week, it was Kris Bryant and then late on Monday, the Cubs called up Addison Russell to join the club on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we'll talk about how bad we've been at predicting when the front office will call up prospects.  </p>
<p>We look at how this team will line up defensively and how the pieces will fit together.  We also take the opportunity to (again) evaluate this team and reconsider our expectations for the 2015 Cubs.  </p>
<p>Though there is no official Scary Stat of the Week, we do share a few stats that are pretty scary in showing us how far the Cubs have come, and how bad things were.</p>
