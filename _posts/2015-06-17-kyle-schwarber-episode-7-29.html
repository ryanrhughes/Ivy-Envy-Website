Within a few months, Kris Bryant, Addison Russell and now Kyle Schwarber have been promoted to the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We talk about Schwarber's fast-track to the majors, why he will be sent to Iowa at the end of the week, when we may see Schwarber back up with the Cubs and how the Cubs intend to use him in 2015 and beyond.</p>
<p>The Cubs have several players on the disabled list and we talk about the progress of these players and what their time-tables for return are.  We briefly discuss the Cardinals hacking topic.  </p>
<p>We went to Peoria on Sunday to see the South Bend Cubs and talk about Gleyber Torres' incredible game.  </p>
