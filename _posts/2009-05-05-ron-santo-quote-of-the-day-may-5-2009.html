<p>A conversation has been brewing in Ivy Envy-land.  It's been discussed many times between us as individuals and hinted at on the podcast.  We all have strong opinions on the Cubs broadcasters.  For us Ivy Envy guys, it's as easy as Bob Brenly vs. Ron Santo.  The conversation is much more deep that just who do you prefer or like.  There are plans for a completely separate Ivy Envy podcast episode to be dedicated to this discussion.</p></p>
<p>We all listen to and watch enough broadcasts to critique these guys beyond what is really fair.  If I had to talk for 3 hours a day, 162 times a year, I think there would be plenty to critique me on.  Listen to the podcast and you'll hear enough in that one hour a week to wonder where I learned to structure sentences.</p></p>
<p>So here is the first entry in the <strong>Broadcaster Quote of the Day</strong> running segment.&nbsp; I would like to note that Tim heard this quote and shared it with me.</p></p>
<blockquote><p>Normally, that one would have been out, yesterday.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>-Ron Santo 5/5/09</p></p>
