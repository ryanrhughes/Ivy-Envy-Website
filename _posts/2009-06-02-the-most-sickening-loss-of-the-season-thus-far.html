<p>Randy Wells must have entered tonight's game thinking "I'm going to throw a no-hitter to ensure this awful bullpen doesn't ruin another start for me."&nbsp; Well, he nearly accomplished that.&nbsp; He took a no-hitter into the 7th and handed the game over to Marmol in the 8th with the Cubs leading 5-1.&nbsp; After an inning of Marmol and an inning of Gregg, the Braves tied the game at 5 and Wells had another win tossed aside by the bullpen.</p>
<p>I'm not really one for drastic moves but Gregg needs to be released now.&nbsp; He's terrible and I believe I mentioned this in one of the podcasts (or maybe someone else did), I can't stomach the idea of watching Kevin Gregg trotting in to pitch the 9th in a playoff situation.&nbsp; Spend some money, slice and dice the bullpen, make a trade...do whatever it takes to get a real closer.&nbsp; This should have been an easy win and rather than scrapping in extras, those guys should have been in the showers making plans for a night out in Atlanta.</p>
<p>These are the types of games that deflate a team.&nbsp; Losing like this on the road leads to lengthy losing streaks.</p>
