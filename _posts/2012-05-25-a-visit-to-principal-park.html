  visited Principal Park in Des Moines for the first time to see the Iowa Cubs beat
  the Tacoma Rainiers 18-8 on May 22. The good news is Rizzo played extremely well
  and was 3-5 with a HR and Steve Clevenger was making a rehab appearance at DH. The
  bad news is Brett Jackson didn't play and Chris Volstad was the starter instead
  of Travis Wood. Here are a few pictures from the day. Tune in to tomorrow's podcast
  to hear my full recap of the day in Des Moines.</div>\r\n<div><a href=\"http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7385\">See
