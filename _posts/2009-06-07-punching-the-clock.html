<p>Well, it took 14 innings, but the Cubs came out on top.&nbsp; And I had my doubts; I'm not going to lie.&nbsp; Once it was Patton vs. Cordero, I thought it would be the end for the Cubs.&nbsp; However, once I saw Mike Lincoln in the 'pen, I knew the Cubs had the whipping boy they were looking for.&nbsp; A friend of Ivy Envy, James (not Jimmy), made me aware of a quotation from Bob Brenly I had missed today: "<span style="color: #000000;">Not much to smile about today... unless you're a fan of pitching and bad at-bats</span>."&nbsp; That about sums it up.&nbsp; This has been a tough past week for the Cubs.&nbsp; Even though they have won three out of the last five, four of those games have gone to extra innings.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962" title="overtime-punch-clock" src="/uploads/2009/06/overtime-punch-clock.jpg" alt="overtime-punch-clock" width="230" height="232" />The team was fortunate to win today's 14-inning marathon.&nbsp; It would have been a demoralizing loss for the team, and today the bullpen made the win possible.&nbsp; With tomorrow being a travel day for the team, there is not much rest in the team's future.&nbsp; However, the Cubs should be able to soundly beat the Astros in their three-game series this week, and that will hopefully boost their morale for the interleague matchup against the Twins this weekend.&nbsp; I will be attending Sunday's game, and I hope to see a Cubs victory--the Twins could be a tough matchup.</p>
<p>One other thing I wanted to mention--the people clamoring for Hoffpauir to take Lee's spot in the lineup until Lee "can start hitting" don't have much of an argument any more.&nbsp; Though he has struggled early in the season with RISP, he has been more clutch lately.&nbsp; Today he came up with a big base-hit with the bases loaded.&nbsp; It feels as though he is getting to where we need him to be.&nbsp; In May, Lee hit .313, and in June, he is hitting .348 so far.&nbsp; To me, the bullpen has becoming a little less of a concern and is being replaced by runners left on base.&nbsp; The Cubs have got to drive in those runs.&nbsp; The pitchers shouldering too much of the burden for the team.&nbsp; Time for the offense to pick them up.</p>
<p>We are planning to record a new episode of the podcast Monday evening, so keep an eye out for that!</p>
