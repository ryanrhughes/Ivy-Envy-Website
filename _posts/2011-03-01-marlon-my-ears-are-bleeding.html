    said, it's not going to last forever, and (much like I said about the eventual
    new stadium move) it will eventually be phased out.  \r\n\r\nI'm not saying it's
    a good thing, but it's the truth.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Sometimes Byrd seems to swoop in out of nowhere to dive for a ball.&nbsp; Sometimes Byrd flies around the bases, trying for an extra-base hit.&nbsp; Or sometimes Byrd even leads his team south to warmer climes before a triumphant return to the north side in April.&nbsp; But sometimes a Byrd takes a crap on something you love.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/02/Tradition.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3996" title="Tradition" src="/uploads/2011/02/Tradition-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a></p><br />
This past Saturday, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-spt-0227-music-cubs-spring-trainin20110225,0,2310779.story">Paul Sullivan wrote a piece</a> about the Cubs considering getting rid of the new plate-approach music at Wrigley Field that was implemented in the middle of the 2010 season.&nbsp; Apparently, a fan at the Cubs Convention asked Tom Ricketts "why they were spoiling 'the Wrigley Field experience'" by replacing the organ music with excerpts of pop music, played while players are walking to the plate.&nbsp; In the article, Marlon Byrd admits that he is the player who originally asked Tom Ricketts for a switch from organ music to "snippets of taped music for hitters' intro songs."&nbsp; Marlon, what were you thinking?&nbsp; Well, it does sound like his intentions were good.&nbsp; Byrd seemed to think that it would boost team morale, but we all know how that turned out.&nbsp; Anyhow, this situation got me wondering about the history of the organ at Wrigley.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.ballparktour.com/Organists.html">BallparkTour.com</a>, the Cubs "brought an organ into Wrigley Field as a one-day only gimmick" in 1941.&nbsp; The fans enjoyed it so much, that they made the organ a permanent fixture at the park, and it began to catch on with other teams as well.&nbsp; For some reason, organ music just seems to meld well with a baseball game on a summer's day; it is music that colors the casual atmosphere and matches the pacing of the sport.&nbsp; It's a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>Now, imagine you're at a ballgame.&nbsp; It's a beautiful day and a pleasant sensory experience.&nbsp; All of a sudden, it feels like your tympanic membranes are being murdered with a spork.&nbsp; This is the song that is playing:</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vJ3BlZe8-fc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hopefully the Ricketts decide to go back to solely organ music.&nbsp; It is my sense that a majority of the fans like it that way.&nbsp; And if the players can't find the motivation to hit well without listening to a Nickleback snippet blaring over ancient speakers, they suck.</p><br />
p.s. Sometimes even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fof40yqaW1U">Marlins will soar</a>.</p>
