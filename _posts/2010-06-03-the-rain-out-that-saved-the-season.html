<p>Last night had the makings of a disaster.  I&rsquo;m not sure us Cubs fans could handle another sweep and series loss to the Pirates.  After Tuesday&rsquo;s loss, I&rsquo;m sure most Cubs fans were sensing that if the Cubs were swept again by the Pirates, everything would implode.  The Cubs are currently 1-7 against the Bucs this year.  You probably don&rsquo;t need to be reminded, but consider their payrolls while looking at that record this season.  The Cubs 2010 payroll is $146.8 million while the Pirates payroll is $34.9 million, which is the lowest in baseball.  Let me give you a visual representation of these numbers.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what would have happened if the Cubs lost to the Pirates again last night.  It just felt like something big would happen.  The last time the Cubs got swept by the Pirates, they called up Starlin Castro.  You are hearing a lot more Cubs fans ready for changes in management and the line-ups.  </p>
<p>There are whisperings of Derrek Lee being on the Angels&rsquo; radar after Kendry Morales&rsquo; celebration injury.  There is no heir-apparent to first base in the Cubs system right now.  Though, after Tuesday&rsquo;s game, you have the sense that Cliffy Six Nad (Xavier Nady) might be able to fill the gap for a while.  I love Derrek Lee and would hate to see him leave Chicago.  But if he was going to go somewhere, the corner of Katella and State College (doesn&rsquo;t have the ring of &ldquo;Clark & Addison&rdquo;) would be ok with me.  </p>
<p>But now, the sweep can be completed on Monday, when the game is made-up.  But I don&rsquo;t think the reaction will be as monumental as if they would have lost last night.  Of course, if the Cubs head to Houston and perform poorly against the Astros, a loss on Monday would be pretty devastating.  </p>
<p>We will wait and see.  Zambrano&rsquo;s start is moved to Friday.  It&rsquo;s his first start since April 20th.  So here&rsquo;s what I will do and I suggest you do, too.  Friday&rsquo;s game in Houston starts a new season.  Many of the Cubs starters have gotten quite a bit of rest in the last week.  Zambrano is back and the rotation is set.  The club is relatively healthy.  I&rsquo;m going to attempt to put my negativity aside.  Tomorrow is Day #1.  I&rsquo;d encourage you to join me in this.  It&rsquo;s for our own sanity.  </p>
