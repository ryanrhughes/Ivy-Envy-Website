<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />As we continue preparing for the playoffs, we use this episode to enjoy the big lead the Cubs have built up and the pretty meaningless games they are playing.  We talk about the state of our nerves heading into the post-season.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have passed the 100-win mark and we talk about the historical significance of that accomplishment.  Theo Epstein has signed a 5-year extension, and we discuss that.  Then we dive into listener questions, which take us all over the place.  This is a pretty loose episode and enjoy it because things are going to get tense in the next week!</p>
