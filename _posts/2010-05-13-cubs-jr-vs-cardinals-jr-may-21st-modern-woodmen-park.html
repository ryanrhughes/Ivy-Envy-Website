<p>We are getting a group together to see the Peoria Chiefs (Class A Cubs affiliate) play the Quad Cities River Bandits (Class A Cardinals affiliate) on Friday, May 21st at Modern Woodmen Park in Davenport, IA.</p>
<p>If you haven't had the opportunity to take in a game at Modern Woodmen Park, it sits on the banks of the Mississippi River and it's a great place to see a game.&nbsp; That evening is "Salute to the '85 Bears" night at the ballpark.&nbsp; I don't really know what they will be doing, but it is sure to involve the Super Bowl Shuffle.&nbsp; They will have their Friday night fireworks after the game, so it'll be fun for the whole family.</p>
<p>The best part of minor league baseball is seeing the future of the franchise in an intimate setting.&nbsp; Growing up, I watched Joe Girardi, Mark Grace, Rafael Palmiero and Greg Maddux play for the Chiefs.&nbsp; So it's more than big names coming down for rehab stints.</p>
<p>Email me at corey@ivyenvy.com if you are interested in joining us.&nbsp; I will see how many people we have interested and get with the Bandits to see what kind of group offer they would have for us.</p>
