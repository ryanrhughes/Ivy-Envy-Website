  content: The same guy was there Saturday -- wearing an "L" flag T-shirt as well
    as the goat head. Since it was the national game, he got WAY too much screen time
    when righties came up to bat.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1040" title="cubs-sox 007" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cubs-sox-007-300x224.jpg" alt="cubs-sox 007" width="442" height="329" />Our new asshat of the week can be seen in the upper-right corner of the photo.&nbsp; Yeah, he's the one wearing the goat mask.&nbsp; Apparently it worked out well for him as the Cubs won the game 5-4.&nbsp; His voice could be heard throughout the broadcast, and I heard him calling Soto a "burnout" during one at-bat.&nbsp; The fan next to him also was sporting an "L" flag.&nbsp; It was fun to see that guy look deflated when Gregg actually saved the game for once.&nbsp; More on the game later.</p>
