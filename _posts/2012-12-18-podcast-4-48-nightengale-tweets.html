<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about some of the events in the last week with the Chicago Cubs.  There is yet another "failed deal" between the Cubs and a free agent.  A few weeks ago, we talked about the frequency of these situations and criticize the media more than the Cubs front office.  Late last week, Bob Nightengale tweeted the Cubs had reached an agreement with free-agent pitcher Anibal Sanchez.  The reports were obviously premature and six tweets and an article later, Nightengale ended up with egg on his face.  </p>
<p>There are lots of angles and things to consider with this situation.  What are the repercussions for this reckless reporting?  Would these things happen if we all weren't so hungry for immediate information?  We'd like to hear what you think about this situation.  Leave a comment below or on our Facebook page - <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast</a>.</p>
<p>We then discuss the Cubs' courtship of Anibal Sanchez and why we would have liked to see him sign with the Cubs.  We also talk about why we're ok with the Cubs missing on him, too.</p>
<p>Andy tells us about Chang-yong Lim, the second closer from Asia that the Cubs have signed in the last two weeks.  Kurt introduces us to the well-traveled Sandy Rosario.  </p>
<p>We wrap the show up with some strong Cubs.com Internet Muscles Flexes and Michael walks away with first, second and third place in the weekly photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>Next Tuesday is Christmas, but we won't leave you empty handed.  We will re-post our baseball card episode.  This originally aired three years ago - December 21st, 2009.  Happy holidays to you and yours from Ivy Envy. </p>
