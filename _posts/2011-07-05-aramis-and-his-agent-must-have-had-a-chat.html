  content: I wonder if those numbers at the end of the season would prompt Hendry
    to exercise that option for next year.

  content: During the postgame show last night the poll question was about Aramis
    being a part of the Cubs' future plans. Last night it was 58% yes. I'm in the
    no column. It's a $16MM option. If they don't exercise it they will pay him $2MM.
    That's $14MM to fill some other holes on this team. It's time to clean house.

<p>Aramis' agent, <em>Paul Kinzer:</em> "Rami (I'm sure that's what he calls him), you do realize that you're a free agent after this season, right?"<em></em></p>
<p><em>Ramirez:</em> "Well, yeah. I had to put a stop to all the trade talk. Thanks for adding that clause. I don't mind losing for another half season and moving is such a pain."<em></em></p>
<p><em>Kinzer:</em> "Ok, but we...I'm mean you, aren't going to get PAID with these kind of numbers."<em></em></p>
<p><em>Ramirez:</em> "What do you mean, Carlos got ten mill. and he only hit .196 last year. Besides, I have a back up plan if this baseball thing doesn't work out. Tyson has pigeons, I have cocks."<em></em></p>
<p><em>Kinzer:</em> "NO, NO, NO. We've covered this. Cockfighting is not a viable profession. 15 million dollars is like 570 million Dominican pesos. That's way too much to ask from your cocks. Just get to work and get those numbers up."</p>
<p>While Ramirez is certainly not afraid of spending more time at the cockfighting ring he must have been motivated by the the potential dent in his paycheck. He's been on an absolute tear lately. He's hit half of his twelve home runs in the last eight games while maintaining a near .400 average over that stretch. One of those home runs was the 300th of his career and one a game-tying shot vs. the Giants in the ninth that allowed the Cubs to take the victory in extra innings. He also picked up a walk off, pinch hit single for another win over the Giants in Wednesday's game.</p>
<p>The hot streak earned A-Ram National League Player of the Week and, if he keeps this up, a potentially huge paycheck. I've been wondering when this Ramirez would show up. I'm guessing he'll end the season around the 30 home run, 100 RBI mark and .300 average plus or minus a few points. He's lucky he plays in a league that will severely overpay for power. His recent performance has raised the reactionary talk about resigning him, but I'm on the side that hopes the Cubs aren't the ones doing the overpaying.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm writing this on Tuesday as the Cubs play the Nationals. Ramirez just hit a two-run shot in the 6th to bring his total to 13 and I don't feel like re-writing this.</p>
