Pitchers and catchers report later this week and that officially begins a new Cubs season and a new season of our podcast. </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about the important Cubs dates in the next month, from pitchers and catchers reporting to Opening Day in Anaheim and everything in-between. </p>
<p>There's lots of Spring Training talk in this episode, too.  One of the listener questions is tips on getting the most out of Spring Training and we share a few tips.  We have several other questions from listeners on this episode. </p>
