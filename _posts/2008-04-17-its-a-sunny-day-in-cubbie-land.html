<p>*&nbsp; The Cubs have a .643 winning percentage.&nbsp; If they were in any division in the American League, they would be in first place.&nbsp; We destroyed the Reds last night and have the opportunity to sweep them today.&nbsp; This weekend, we face the Pirates.&nbsp; A team that we just swept at their place last week.&nbsp; If we can just get a good outing from Lilly (he needs it) and keep the bats alive, I'm thinking we'll be in good shape.&nbsp;<a id="more"></a><a id="more-20"></a></p>
<p>*&nbsp; Is it just me, or has it been a lot of fun to watch Dusty manage the Reds?&nbsp; Keep up the good work!</p>
<p>* Who needs Soriano?&nbsp; It doesn't feel right to say that it's probably a good thing that a team's highest paid player is on the DL.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I feel that way and I'm guessing there's a lot of Cubs fans that feel the same way</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Anytime that the Cardinals pitching staff wants to return to their actual skill level, that would be nice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Congrats to Paul, the only Ivy Envy writer that has not registered yet.&nbsp; He is the new dad to a baby boy named Cooper that was born last night.</p>
