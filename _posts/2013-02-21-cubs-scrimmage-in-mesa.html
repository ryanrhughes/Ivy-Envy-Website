<p>After what actually seemed like a pretty short off-season, (fake) Cubs baseball is back!  The Cubs had a intra-squad scrimmage at Hohokam Stadium on Thursday.  Here's how the team was split up:</p>
<p><u><strong>White Team</strong></u><br />
DeJesus CF<br />
Castro SS<br />
Rizzo 1B<br />
Soriano LF<br />
Schierholtz RF<br />
Navarro C<br />
Stewart 3B<br />
Barney 2B<br />
Hairston DH</p>
<p><u><strong>Blue Team</strong></u><br />
Valbuena 2B<br />
Sappelt CF<br />
Castillo C<br />
Nelson 1B<br />
Soler LF<br />
Baez SS<br />
Lake 3B<br />
Jackson RF<br />
Bogusevic DH</p>
<p>The White team bested the Blue team, 7-3.  Starlin Castro went 3-3 in the game, but the highlight of the game was a HR hit by <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/organization-top-10-prospects/2013/2614527.html" target="_blank">#3 Prospect</a> Jorge Soler.  We are having trouble embedding videos on our site.  Do yourself a favor and <a href="http://youtu.be/ImPG42xf6wY" target="_blank">go check out the video</a>. </p>
<p>It is encouraging the see one of the highly-touted prospects perform well.  But what do we really learn from that hit?  Soler can tattoo Nick Struck-caliber pitching.  </p>
<p>The Cubs will have another scrimmage at Hohokam tomorrow and then open Spring Training games on Saturday vs. the Angels.  </p>
