  content: Hey guys ... update on MLB.TV ... I called to find out if the MLB Audio
    app is included with the "Single" team MLB.TV package.&nbsp; They told me that
    it was included but only for the team you purchased.&nbsp; I also emailed the
    question just to make double sure and was told the same thing.&nbsp; Keep up the
    good work, GO CUBS!

On this episode, we talk about some of the storylines coming out of Mesa so far this Spring Training.  The position players haven't officially reported yet, although most of them are there, and there's already the typical Spring Training storylines.  Arrieta will avoid running out of gas late in the season, Kris Bryant's swing isn't as steep and Joe Maddon intends to keep the players' heads in the right place.  </p>
