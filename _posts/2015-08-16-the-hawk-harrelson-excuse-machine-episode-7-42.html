<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>It was yet another exciting week in Cubs baseball.  The Cubs only lost one game, today's game against the White Sox.  We give a lot of respect to Sale, who pitched a spectacular game, but don't have many other nice things to say about the White Sox, especially Hawk Harrelson.  </p>
<p>We look at the hot-streak the Cubs have been on since the Phillies series and look at a few team and player stats that have helped facilitate the winning streak.  Corey talks about a benefit of Joe Maddon managing this team like they're in the playoffs...and it's not all about just getting wins.  </p>
<p>Somehow, in the midst of this stretch of incredible Cubs baseball, Kurt finds a negative scary stat.  We also share a few internet muscle flexes, one of which calls for the dismissal of Joe Maddon.  </p>
