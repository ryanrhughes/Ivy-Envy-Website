<p>We recognized the fact that the 2009 season has been very frustrating for Cubs fans and we felt everyone deserved the opportunity to take out their aggression.&nbsp; Twenty has a punching bag game that registers the strength of your punches.&nbsp; Everyone was given the opportunity to choose one of five Cubs personalities and we taped the faces of those people to the punching bag.&nbsp; Listen to the podcast for the results, but here are some videos.</p>
