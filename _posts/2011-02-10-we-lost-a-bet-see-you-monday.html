    winning the division even when no one picked them to and despite the fact that
    they got knocked out in the first round. \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Last year, we rounded up some bloggers for other teams in the NL Central for our division preview episode on the podcast.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know any bloggers for other teams, so I just started browsing baseball blogs.&nbsp; There was one site that caught my eye purely because of the name.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo&rsquo;s Goggles</a> is a Cincinnati Reds blog run by Brian Welch.&nbsp; Brian is a Reds fan that lives in Chicago.&nbsp; It must be tough to live in the belly of the beast of the team you dislike the most.</p>
<p>Entering the 2010 season, we made a little wager with Chris.&nbsp; The winner of the bet would be determined by whose team won the head-to-head record.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember what the final tally was, but I&rsquo;ll tell you that it wasn&rsquo;t close&hellip;.and the Cubs didn&rsquo;t win.&nbsp; I thought we had a chance to win the bet.&nbsp; I thought the Cubs would be better than they were.&nbsp; I looked at a pitching rotation that included Aaron Harang and Bronson Arroyo and though, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win this bet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Plus, I didn&rsquo;t know much about this fellow named Joey Votto.</p>
<p>The wager was this:&nbsp; The loser of the bet has to re-direct their site to the winner&rsquo;s site for 3 days.&nbsp; So Friday &ndash; Sunday, if you go to <a href="http://www.ivyenvy.com/">www.ivyenvy.com</a>, you will see a &ldquo;C&rdquo; with a slightly different shape and a whole lot of red.</p>

<p>I should have paid up on this bet in November or December, when there was very little going on.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m a procrastinator and now I&rsquo;m trying to squeeze it in right before pitchers and catchers report to Spring Training.</p>
<p>So, farewell for a few days&hellip;. Go Cubs!</p>
