<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the Joe Maddon hiring.  When we recorded our last regular episode, we would have never guessed the Cubs would have a new manager right now.  A few weeks after announcing that Ricky Renteria would be returning for 2015, the Cubs front office was faced with a tough decision when Joe Maddon was suddenly available.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about the one-year Ricky Renteria era.  What did he do well and what did he do poorly?  We give our thoughts on the Joe Maddon press conference.  It didn't take long for a lot of Cubs fans to become infatuated with Maddon during that press conference.  Andy talks about his history as a manager, and lists a few other reasons that the Cubs should be really interesting under Maddon.</p>
<p>Kurt talks about what the Maddon hiring means for the Cubs in this off-season and beyond.  The internet muscle flexers were out in force after the hiring, so we read some of those.  </p>
