<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 401<sup>st</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  We start this episode off by talking about whether or not Cubs fans should be concerned about the Cubs recent habit of losing games and series.  </p>
<p>We dive into the Giants series like Jason Heyward dives into a wall, making an incredible (and incredibly scary) catch.  We talk about Heyward's injury and the relief that all Cubs fans felt when the Cubs announced he would only be out 3-5 days.  </p>
<p>In discussing the series, we also talk about Lester, Soler, Baez, and others.  Andy previews the Cardinals series. Kurt has a scary stat of the week and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
