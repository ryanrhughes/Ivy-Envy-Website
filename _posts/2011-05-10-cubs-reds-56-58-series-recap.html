<p>The Cubs continued to set sail on their failboat toward their destination of total offensive ineptitude.&nbsp; They&nbsp; left eight on base and were 2-12 with runners in scoring position.&nbsp; Garza didn't have that great of an outing as he gave up five earned runs.&nbsp; The biggest blow was Jay Bruce's three-run homer in the fourth.&nbsp; The good news is&nbsp;Garza got his first big-league hit.&nbsp; Sweet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">You're welcome.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This game was nothing to scream about since the Cubs offense was as anemic as ever for most of the game.&nbsp; It drives me crazy to see Bronson Arroyo shut down the Cubs.&nbsp; The game was highly entertaining in the ninth inning, however.&nbsp; The Cubs won the game on a single by Fukudome.&nbsp; Carlos Pena had tied the game earlier in the inning on a solo homer.&nbsp; His bat has begun to warm up.&nbsp; I'm not saying it's blazing hot, but at least it's tepid.</p><br />

<p>I actually got to watch this turd.&nbsp; I figured the Cubs would have a great chance to touch up Cueto with it being his first start of the season.&nbsp; I thought for sure he would be rusty.&nbsp; Not the case.&nbsp; Cueto pitched six innings of shutout baseball.&nbsp; The Cubs also failed to get to the Reds bullpen, totally wasting Ryan Dempster's quality start.</p>
<p><strong>First Breath After Coma</strong></p>
<p>Carlos Pena seems to be getting on track somewhat at the plate.&nbsp; He drew three walks on Friday and had a three-hit game on Saturday.&nbsp; He also hit his first homer at Wrigley.&nbsp; We will talk about Pena on the next podcast and discuss our thoughts on whether he will continue to deliver for the Cubs.</p>
<p><strong>Uh-oh?</strong></p>
<p>Starlin Castro is mired in his first slump of the season.&nbsp; He is 7-51 in the last 12 games, and his cold hitting is coming right on the heels of being featured on the cover of <em>Sports Illustrated</em>.&nbsp; Castro will also be an upcoming podcast topic.</p>
<p><strong>Up Next</strong></p>
<p>The Cardinals come to Chicago for a three-game series.&nbsp; Though Pujols hasn't been hitting very well, Holliday and Berkman have been tearing it up.&nbsp; The Cubs pitchers will have to shut these tools down if the Cubs want to beat the Cards.&nbsp; Theriot also will be playing at Wrigley for the first time since his comment about being on the "right side of the rivalry."&nbsp; Enjoy the boos and your terrible soul patch.</p>
