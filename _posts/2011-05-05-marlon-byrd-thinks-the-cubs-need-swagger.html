    streak make some noise - let's be honest, nobody in the NL Central is really that
    good...\r\n\r\nDownside: You are also right about being a \"team in transistion,'
    but the question is transition to what?"

    you try to light a fire under somebody's ass, it causes their intestines to blow
    up.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "And plus, \"swagger\" is kind of a short term solution to a long term
    problem, and although I realize we probably won't make the postseason this year,
    I don't think we need to be thinking ahead to 2013 just yet.  \r\n\r\nBut I still
    love you.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "You raise another good question - just what is Mike Quade? At first, he
    was the interim, whom the Cubs announced would not be considered for the job permanently.
    Then all of a sudden, he's the guy, but only for a two-year deal.\r\n\r\nWhat
    am I missing on this? Sandberg seemed like the perfect guy for the gig, now he's
    managing the farm in the Phillies organization. What happened?"

  content: "Ryan - I see \"swagger\" as confidence, not fire.  I think it's the type
    of confidence that comes with winning and some success.  It's what allows win-streaks
    to stay alive.  \r\n\r\nI suppose the only reason I look ahead to 2013 is because
    of how different this team could look in a few years.  \r\n\r\nJW - I think there's
    a very good chance that Hendry and the ownership did not want to feel like that
    HAD to hire Sandberg.  I also think that if the Cubs would have hired Sandberg,
    they probably would find themselves in the position (eventually) of having to
    fire him as a manager.  How difficult would it be to fire the guy that everyone
    in our generation probably sees as their \"Mr. Cub\"?"

<p>There's no doubt that we are seeing the Cubs in a state of transition.  Sure, Soriano might be around for a few more years, but there are some major pieces to the Cubs puzzle that have been around for years that won't be on this team in the somewhat near future.</p>
<p>So what is this Cubs team?  Nobody really knows.  The identity of this team has not been formed.  With Mike Quade's short two-year contract, you can't help but think he is filling a gap.  Quade is a solid system guy without a huge personality.  Even though his contract is only two years, this team will look quite a bit different at the beginning of the 2013 season as compared to when he took over in August of 2010.</p>
<p>We're seeing a team that is playing decent, but seems to be struggling.  <a href="http://marlonbyrd.mlblogs.com/2011/05/04/54-swagger/" target="_blank">Marlon Byrd wrote in his blog</a> that what this Cubs team is lacking is swagger. &nbsp;Byrd is probably right. &nbsp;This is a team of highly-paid veterans that honestly don't feel the need to play with urgency. &nbsp;They are getting paid. &nbsp;They have spent the last two years on a team that has not produced and that hasn't influenced their paychecks, or really, their lives.</p>
<p>Then you have the young players. &nbsp;They haven't experienced anything to give them swagger. &nbsp;Swagger is not a trait that you just create. &nbsp;It is a form of confidence that develops through winning and success. &nbsp;Byrd has this swagger and I think he's a good guy to have in the clubhouse. &nbsp;He is a guy that can put his arm around a guy like Barney and assure him that his success this year is not a fluke and he can instill some of that confidence in the young players.</p>
<p>I think this is a .500 club, but I think if they can get on a hot streak, things could really start rolling with this group.</p>
