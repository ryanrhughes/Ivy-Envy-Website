  content: The Cubs can play as many day games as they want.....from mid-June until
    mid-August.  I am lucky enough to get two months off every summer.  But until
    mid-June, I hate day games.  We don't get a good AM radio signal in our office,
    so I have to resort to watching little graphics on MLB.com.

<p>No, not that kind. Days like today make me appreciate the fact that the Cubs play so many day games. I'm at work. I am working. Not this very second, but It's been a pretty productive today. I just got back from lunch, closed my door and turned on my radio. Listening to baseball on a crackly AM radio on a warm Spring day is a great thing. The game started at 1:20, just after lunch, and should carry me through most of my afternoon. Pat relayed the uniform information down to sock color and Ron is still trying to figure how to score a game on his card. What a great Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Cubs have been steadily reducing the number of day games at Wrigley. I can only assume due to the pressures of prime time television and the revenue that comes with it. I still enjoy the day games and hope they stick around even if their numbers are reduced. What do you think?</p>
