<p>There is a phrase that I used quite a bit last year and I'm about to use it for the first time of the season.&nbsp; This is a phrase that Cubs fans don't get to use often because it seems we rarely have a team worthy of it.&nbsp; I haven't heard many baseball fans use it, but I'm sure they do.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-51"></a></p>
<p>This week, the Cubs play the Brewers and the Cardinals.&nbsp; The two teams closest to them in the division right now.&nbsp; I don't think the Cardinals will be there in September, but it's baseball and crazier things have happened.&nbsp; I do think the Brewers will be in contention throughout the season.&nbsp; So..."This next week will show us alot about where the team is right now".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure you've heard different wordings "This next series/week will be the test" or "This next series/weak will give us a good measurement"...it's all the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The great thing is, I will probably say this at least a dozen times this season.&nbsp; Whether I'm referring to a game, series or stretch of series, I will undoubtedly judge this team based on those measurements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also say that "this game" or "this play" will turn the tide of the season one direction or the other.&nbsp; As fans, it seems that we give momentum such a high value.&nbsp; I assume professional athletes do not view games in this way.&nbsp; Let's hope that Soto doesn't believe in momentum and avoids striking out for the 9th time in a row tonight.&nbsp;</p>
