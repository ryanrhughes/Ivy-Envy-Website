<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>Here we are, Cubs fans.  For the first time in our 7 years and 354 episodes of podcasting on the Chicago Cubs, we have a post-season game to talk about.  </p>
<p>We dissect this Cubs/Pirates Wild Card game and look at the teams' offenses and how the starting pitchers have fared against the opposing teams so far this season.  We make our predictions and play the predictions that listeners called in.</p>
<p>Before we do that though, we bring on Katie Day, the creator of what many Cubs fans consider to the anthem of this Cubs team's playoff push, "By the Lakeside".  </p>
