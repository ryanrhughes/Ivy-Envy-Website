I think you'll enjoy this interview with Randy Wehofer, the play-by-play voice of the Iowa Cubs.  </p>
<p>Because of his role as a broadcaster, he has had the opportunity on a daily basis to see what is widely considered the best team in the best minor league system in all of baseball.  </p>
<p>This conversation was recorded before Javier Baez was promoted to the Cubs, so we spend quite a bit of time talking about him, as well as Kris Bryant and Jorge Soler.  Randy also talks about Manny Ramirez, his role with the team and his influence on younger players.  </p>
