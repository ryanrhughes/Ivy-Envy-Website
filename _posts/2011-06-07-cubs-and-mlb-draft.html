  content: That video production is hilarious. Black and yellow, black and yellow.
    Can't wait to see him hit in Peoria.

  content: Yeah, that's why I gave people the times to go to, so they don't have to
    suffer through that production more than necessary.

  content: "For the record, every player looks small at that age, but Jacksonville
    is a tough place to grow up, maybe even tougher than Miami.  There's a lot of
    crime and such. I'm looking for some great things to come from this kid.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "And does anybody else think that it's weird that the Cubs would be interested
    in Shawn Dunston's son?  I mean, they didn't hire Sandberg to be the manager so
    why wouldn't they want to forget about anything associated with that era.\r\n\r\nBut
    then when you think about it...it is an eleventh round pick...\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The second day of the 2011 MLB First-Year Player Draft is finished. &nbsp;If you missed it yesterday, the Cubs had the 9th overall pick and chose Javier Baez, a 18 year-old from Jacksonville, Florida. &nbsp;</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/06/Javier-Baez.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/06/Javier-Baez.jpg" alt="" title="Javier Baez" width="250" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5405" /></a></center></p>
<p>Baez played shortstop in high school, but would be a candidate to move to 3rd base because of his limited range.   If you have to take high school statistics with a grain of salt because of the level of competition, you might want to take these stats with a 20 lb bag of ice-melt. &nbsp;In his Senior year at Arlington Country Day School, Baez hit .771 with 22 homeruns, 20 doubles and six triples. &nbsp;He also had 28 stolen basis and 32 walks, while striking out just three times.</p>
<p>In the 2nd round, the Cubs picked another high-schooler from Florida, Daniel Vogelbach. &nbsp;Vogelbach is power hitting first basemen that is six-feet tall and 250 pounds. &nbsp;If that description reminds you of Prince Fielder, wait until you watch this video. &nbsp;Watch him run at the 1:12 mark and then hit, starting at the 3:50 mark.  Also, check out his 508-foot shot at the 6:41 mark.  </p>

<p>In the last two days, the Cubs have drafted 30 players. &nbsp;You can find the entire list <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/events/draft/y2011/drafttracker.jsp?p=0&amp;s=30&amp;sc=pick_number&amp;so=ascending&amp;st=number&amp;ft=TM&amp;fv=chc" target="_blank">here</a>. &nbsp;If you browse through the list, there will be a few names that you recognize. &nbsp;With their 7th pick (219th overall), the Cubs drafted Trevor Gretzky, son of Wayne Gretzky. &nbsp;Gretzky is drafted straight out of Oaks Christian High School in California. &nbsp;I had heard of Trevor before, from the media attention surrounding his nationally ranked football team. &nbsp;Gretzky was teammates with fellow celebrity-kids Nick Montana (Joe) and Trey &nbsp;Smith (Will).</p>
<p>Another name that will be very familiar to Cubs fans is Shawon Dunston Jr, who was the Cubs' 11th pick (339th overall). &nbsp;Dunston is also being drafted straight out of high school. &nbsp;It sounds that Dunston plays a lot like his dad did -- with lots of energy. &nbsp;He supposedly once scored from 2nd base on a dropped 3rd strike.</p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part. &nbsp;Just because a player is drafted does not mean that the player has to sign with the organization. &nbsp;Players that are finishing up high school have usually committed to a college and can choose to honor that commitment and leave a pro contract on the table. &nbsp;Dunston has committed to play baseball at Vanderbilt, so he may think he could improve his draft stock with a season or two in college. &nbsp;It will be interesting to see which players end up signing with the Cubs and start working their way into the farm system. &nbsp;I definitely look forward to seeing some of these guys in Peoria at some point.</p>
