<p>This bullpen is not good enough.  It will plague the team all season.  Hendry should recognize that now and make some drastic changes.  Spend money, deal some guys, do what it takes.</p>
<p>Today's display was disgusting and although I didn't watch all of the post-game with Lou, I was amazed at how much he defended and made excuses for Gregg.  Of course, I understand how things work and it wouldn't surprise me if things weren't a little different in his office when cameras weren't around.  If Lou was half as mad as I was storming around my house, heads will roll.&nbsp; I should be happy that the Cubs beat Roy Oswalt, but as far as I'm concerned, that game was a loss.  But Bobby Scales should hold his head high.  I believe he's earned a place in every Cubs fan's heart.</p>
<p>I'm not sold on the idea that Gregg will cut it.  Florida fans sure seemed awful happy to get rid of him.</p>
<p>Easy win for Marshall and tough no-decision for Wells.<br />
The only thing shorter than Marshall's 3-pitch win today was <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090516&amp;content_id=4770810&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb">John Lackey's 2 pitch season debut</a> for the Angels.</p>
