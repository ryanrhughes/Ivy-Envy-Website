    Ryan Flaherty is playing short, that's got to be an experience to have Aramis
    Ramirez in the field right next to you."

<p><strong>12:17:00 PM</strong>: There is an incredibly long line down to the home dugout for autograph seekers</p>
<p><strong>12:46:03 PM</strong>: A-ram and johnson are out warming up with the team-looks like johnson will be leading off. #Cubs</p>
<p><strong>1:02:06 PM</strong>: For whatever reason, Rebel and Brenly didn't receive the same response Ramirez did during pregame intro.</p>
<p><strong>1:04:29 PM</strong>: Reed catches a pop fly in cf for first out of the game.</p>
<p><strong>1:07:23 PM</strong>: Reed to the plate now to lead off</p>
<p><strong>1:09:51 PM</strong>: Base hit up the middle for Reed! #Cubs</p>
<p><strong>1:13:45 PM</strong>: Ramirez 1st AB-base hit to left-Reed at 2nd</p>
<p><strong>1:16:12 PM</strong>: Rebel doubles in Reed, Ramirez to third</p>
<p><strong>1:18:01 PM</strong>: Reed really hustled around third and slid into home-he appears to be ready for big league action</p>
<p><strong>1:20:23 PM</strong>: They are now playing who let the dogs out.  Thanks o'brien field</p>
<p><strong>1:21:50 PM</strong>: I have a great view of Michael Brenly right now that Corey would enjoy</p>
<p><strong>1:24:30 PM</strong>: Chiefs have the Spud Webb of baseball at 2nd-Josh Harrison</p>
<p><strong>1:25:38 PM</strong>: Ramirez makes a routine grounder to third look routine to end the top of the 2nd. #Cubs</p>
<p><strong>1:30:36 PM</strong>: Reed 2nd AB-flyout to center on a 69-mph pitch.</p>
<p><strong>1:46:52 PM</strong>: A-ram's 2nd ab-draws a walk.  The pitcher appeared to be nibbling, and ramirez had a good eye.</p>
<p><strong>1:54:13 PM</strong>: There is a lady with a cardinals tattoo selling raffle tickets to win an autographed ramirez &amp; johnson baseball bats</p>
<p><strong>2:13:00 PM</strong>: Top 5- Reed hits a very weak tapper to 2nd for an out</p>
<p><strong>2:18:58 PM</strong>: Ramirez 3rd ab-hits a foul ball near me, flies out to deep right field.  His bat speed looks good, but the pitchers arent overpowering #cubs</p>
<p><strong>2:22:46 PM</strong>: Flaherty replaces Ramirez in the top of the fifth.  Johnson is still in.</p>
<p><strong>2:24:37 PM</strong>: A-ram's arm fell off, revealing a twisted mass of cybernetic wires.  J/k he's fine.</p>
<p><strong>2:54:14 PM</strong>: Bot 7- Johnson pops out to third- amazing how fast he takes off on a pop fly- he has been halfway to 2nd when both of his flies were caught</p>
<p><strong>2:58:53 PM</strong>: Johnson lifted in the eighth for macias.  Only 2 hits between johnson and ramirez. #Cubs</p>
<p><strong>3:01:40 PM</strong>: Along with his walk, Ramirez made solid contact with the ball twice.  Reed's best contact was the hard hit grounder base hit #cubs</p>
<p><strong>3:07:57 PM</strong>: A Peoria Chiefs shirt just fell into my lap.  I was the only one sitting down and not going nuts.</p>
<p><strong>3:24:06 PM</strong>: I've always enjoyed the dizzy bat race in between innings at minor league games.  One kid just about hurled today.</p>
<p><strong>3:48:58 PM</strong>: Chiefs lose to the Snappers 2-4.  Young Brenly went 3-4 with a double.</p>
<p><strong>3:50:17 PM</strong>: Apparently Vitters was called up to Daytona last week?  I was a little slow on that one.</p>
