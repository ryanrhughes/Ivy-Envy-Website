On this episode, we talk about the Cubs/Pirates series.  We recorded this episode during the final game of the series.  The Cubs ended up winning the game and sweeping the series.  </p>
<p>The Cubs front office gave us another cookie this week with the promotion of Willson Contreras.  We talk about Contreras, his minor league career to this point, and how Contreras fits into this team from this point forward.  </p>
<p>Kurt shares a Jon Lester scary stat and we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
