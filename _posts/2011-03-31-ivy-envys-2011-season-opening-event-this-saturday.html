<p>We are kicking off the 2011 Cubs season with a live podcast recording/game-watch/bags tournament at Twenty Sports Grille and Nightclub in downtown Moline.  We'll get things started at 11am.  Come on down and watch us fumble our way through a podcast recording.  The Cubs play the Pirates at noon and we'll start the bags tournament after the podcast.  It will be a doubles tournament, so bring a partner.  The winning team will receive gift certificates to Twenty.  </p>
<p>We also have stuff to give away.  We will be drawing names for a Hall of Famer, Fergie Jenkins autograph, a Majestic therma-base Cubs jacket that retails for $120, tickets for Peoria Chiefs/QC River Bandits games and much more.  </p>
<p>So come on down and hang out with other Quad Cities Cubs fans.  Twenty has great food, twenty different beers on tap and it's a spectacular place to watch baseball.  </p>
