<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt continue plowing through the off-season with this episode. We are able to speculate on Tanaka with one last episode. By the next episode, Tanaka will have chosen a signed with a Major League Baseball team. We discuss the latest rumors which include teams, money figures and Japanese populations in those particular cities.</p>

<p>We read some iTunes reviews. Thanks to everyone that left us an iTunes review this week. You're all too kind. If you have not yet left us a review, we would appreciate your review. It helps us in iTunes and we will read your review on the show.</p>
<p>We take a few minutes to summarize our thoughts on <a href="http://twitter.com/clarkthecub" target="_blank">Clark the Cub</a>. &nbsp;If you have not heard our bonus episode on the unveiling of the new Cubs mascot, check out <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-44-six-year-olds-thoughts-clark-cub/" target="_blank">Episode 5.44</a>. &nbsp;That is a short episode that contains an interview with someone in the targeted demographic for the mascot, Corey's six-year old daughter.</p>
<p>Cubs Convention 2014 has come and gone. &nbsp;We did not attend the convention, but through the magic of Twitter, we were able to track what was going on...and now we can comment on the main issues that were discussed.</p>
<p>The Cubs will be wearing throwback uniforms at Wrigley Field to celebrate the 100th birthday of the ballpark. &nbsp;The front office gives an update with the renovation plans. &nbsp;This includes news about the time-frame of when the renovations will be completed, as well as some explanation as to what the hang ups are, as well as the Ricketts family television viewing preferences. &nbsp;Speaking of television, the tv and radio broadcasts also came up at Cubs Convention. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in the last week, we learned details on MLB's new replay policy.</p>

<p>You will want to hear this interview if you're into any of the following: &nbsp;meat, beer, grilling, being a guy or people using their talents to be super creative with the things they are passionate about.</p>
