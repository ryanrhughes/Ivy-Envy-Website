<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the dismissal of Dale Sveum and what led to the Cubs deciding to move in a different direction.  The move feels to have been made a year too early, but we look at why the Cubs wanted to part ways now, rather than after the end Sveum's contract with the organization.  We look ahead at a few of the candidates and talk about who we'd like to see take the reins and what characteristics we'd like that person to have.  </p>
