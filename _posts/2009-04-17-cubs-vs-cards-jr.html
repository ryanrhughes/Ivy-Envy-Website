<p>Last night Corey and I went to the Peoria Chiefs vs. Quad City River Bandits game. As the Cubs face the Cardinals in the start of a four game series their single A midwest league&nbsp;affiliates also squared off. Having the Bandits in the Quad Cities with a beautiful ballpark on the river has been a huge plus for local baseball fans. But being a Cubs fan disqualifies me from rooting for the Bandits. Their future stars slide through the QC on their way up or out. In 2006 <a title="Colby Rasmus" href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=458675" target="_blank">Colby Rasmus</a>, the Cards current backup outfielder, was on the roster. Rick Ankiel made a stop in 2005. Oddly enough many of the Cardinals stars (Pujols, Molina and Duncan) played for the Peoria Chiefs when they were a Cardinals affiliate from 96-04.</p>
<p>We were there to check out the Cubs' rising stars Josh Vitters, Ryan Flaherty and the son of Bob, Michael Brenly. It didn't hurt that it was "Thirsty Thursday" and the beers were only $2. The only bad thing is that we didn't figure out that the good beer was the same price as the cheap domestic crap until the 7th inning.</p>
<p><a title="Baseball America Top Ten" href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/organization-top-10-prospects/2009/267407.html" target="_blank">Baseball America</a> lists Vitters as the Cubs' #1 prospect ahead of Samardzija at 2 and Andrew Cashner at 3. Flaherty comes in at 8. Vitters was the third overall pick in 2007 out of&nbsp;Cypress High School (Anaheim, Calif.). His <a title="Vitters-Chiefs" href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?n=Josh%20Vitters&amp;pos=3B&amp;sid=t443&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=519388" target="_blank">Chiefs profile</a>&nbsp;calls him "the most polished high school hitter in the 2007 draft pool". He signed with 4th largest signing bonus at $3.25 million (1-3 are Prior, Fukudome and the elder Patterson). He'll celebrate his 20th birthday in August.&nbsp;<a title="Ryan Flaherty" href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?n=Ryan%20Flaherty&amp;pos=SS&amp;sid=t443&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=475247" target="_blank">Flaherty</a>&nbsp;was one of the Cubs' 2008 first round picks (41st overall).</p>
<p>Both are listed at 6' 3", 200 lbs, but Flaherty's seems to be a much more intimidating physical presence at the plate (More on <a title="Brenly" href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=574#more-574" target="_self">Brenly's physical presence</a> from Corey). Vitters is&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;small given his power and ability to drive the ball. He was drafted for his hitting and it appeared that's what he was there to do. In his first two at bats he saw three pitches driving two balls hard to center field both times. The first right at the center fielder and the second for a hit. He ended his night 2-5 with one K. It's hard to say if he will always be so aggressive or if he's been instructed to swing away and work on driving the ball. He made contact with anything near the strike zone and his strikeout came when he chased a few out of the zone. Flaherty went 1 for 5 with a hit, three ground outs and a K. With my limited viewing it looks like both have a lot of promise with the bat. Fielding was more difficult to analyze, but Vitters doesn't seem to be a major league caliber third baseman yet. During a bathroom brake Corey filled me in on his ball between the legs play a-la me in little league. Coach says keep your glove down...stay in front of it. Granted, single A games are full of errors and base running mistakes and this one had its fair share. It seems to be a general rule, and a good one, that teams draft good arms, speed and bats and worry about the fielding later.</p>
<p>Prospects are a hard thing to evaluate as a casual fan. Sure, both looked pretty good to me, but will they both be with the organization long enough to see Chicago? We'll see. As the #1 and #8 prospects I can't see the Cubs letting go of Vitters or Flaherty without great value in return. Vitters was the main bargaining tool in the possible off season deal for Jake Peavy. Peavy has a Cy Young. They're not guys you look to deal, but we'll see if that tone changes in July if the Cubs are in a pennant race and have some holes to fill.</p>
<p>By the way...the Chiefs losing pitcher: CHRIS CARPENTER!</p>
