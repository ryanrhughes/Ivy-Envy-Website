<p>The Cubs scored 9 runs on Monday night.&nbsp; Come on, you knew the offense was going to sputter and score no more than 1 run on Tuesday night.&nbsp; Historically, it's a sure-thing for the Cubs.&nbsp; If the Cubs rack up tons of hits and runs, it's guaranteed the bats will be silent the next night.&nbsp; We had a few big margin wins this season and the Cubs didn't&nbsp;suffer what I will refer to as "The Large Magin Hangover".&nbsp; The fact they had continued to score and pile up wins <a id="more"></a><a id="more-115"></a>was more evidence to me that maybe this team IS special.&nbsp; Maybe it IS destiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, the Cubs tossed aside this new brand of baseball.&nbsp; They are now officially a real Chicago Cubs team.&nbsp; After looking like a fool all spring by discussing the latest Cubs big margin win at my work and then predicting a shutout or being held to one run, I now feel confident that this team is still the Cubs and I am probably safe with that prediction.</p>
