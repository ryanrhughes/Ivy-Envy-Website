  content: Being bad and not working hard are 2 different things, and don't necessarily
    go hand in hand with each other. All reports are that Soriano is a hard worker
    and a great teammate. You don't have to be vocal to be a leader, that is all he
    is saying. Soriano is an aging veteran, with decreasing skills and a wildly outrageous
    contract. None of that is his fault, it happens. &nbsp;No one would have been
    able to live up to the contract he got. &nbsp;What was he supposed to do, turn
    down the money? We are stuck with Soriano, and fans ripping him all the time is
    not helping. Deal with it.&nbsp;

  content: If Soriano works so hard in preparation, why is he so bad during the games?
    &nbsp;I don't see how lackadaisical play in the field and watching deep fly-outs
    is "being bad" rather than "not working hard". &nbsp;When you make a mistake and
    react by grinning, I have a hard time believing you have a burning desire to win.

  content: 'He''s bad during games because he is an aging veteran. His legs are gone.
    And his offensive numbers are not really terrible. They look worse because his
    contract. He does do some frustrating things, but multiple coaches and players
    have said he is a great teammate and a hard worker. I''d like to believe they
    know better than us. '

    I think it's possible that the Cubs are glossing over his lack of effort right now in an attempt to make him move-able at some point this year. &nbsp;Unlike the Cubs under Jim Hendry, I don't think we'll see the Cubs running down players trade values. &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    How in the hell can Dale Sveum talk about the expectations for effort and then say "Yeah, standing and watching a fly-ball is a difficult thing to break." &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    Good discussion though. &nbsp;I love seeing an exchange of opinions. &nbsp;

  content: Being a great teammate is one thing but putting the skills out on the baseball
    field is another. &nbsp;If he is aging then he needs to work with the trainers
    to get his body to where it needs to be at such an old age. It is very clear to
    me, and other fans, that he is very lazy on the field and when he is batting.
    He strikes out more than anyone I can remember and he runs after fly balls like
    they are going to be in the air for hours. If we are paying him so much money
    to be great, then he needs to put in the effort to make sure he is doing so.&nbsp;

  content: Actually, that isn't the funniest part of the quote to me at all.&nbsp;
    The funniest part of the quote to me is by far the first line.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I
    don't like to be the leader"&nbsp;&nbsp; Although at surface value there isn't
    much there to make you laugh, there is hidden entertainment value because just
    the fact that he thinks for some reason he needs to clarify that is hilarious.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We've been covering this team for what...six hundred games at this point and that
    guy has the audacity to think that for some weird reason we just haven't noticed?&nbsp;
    In his defense based on his grammar I'm not even sure that he knows what he's
    talking about either.&nbsp;

<p>If you read our blog regularly, you could probably accuse me (accurately) of perseverating.  With the new changes in the organization and the clear and concise change in focus with the Cubs, the one person that stands out as potentially not fitting with that change is Alfonso Soriano.  </p>
<p>Last wee, I posted that signs may indicate that <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6709" target="_blank">we won't see Soriano held to the same standards</a> as the other players when it comes to things as simple as not standing and watching a warning-track shot.  Well, to start your week off on the right foot, I'd like to share this <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/baseball-chicago-cubs/news/Cubs-set-out-to-create-a-new-identity?blockID=663208&feedID=619" target="_blank">Soriano quote</a> with you.  If you've seen Soriano play one game, you'll find the humor in it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t like to be the leader.  My teammates can see how I play hard and how I work. I think they can take that to the field. I don&rsquo;t like to talk much. Just work hard and try to be better every day and try to win. That&rsquo;s what I can take to the young guys here.&rdquo; - Alfonso Soriano</blockquote></p>
<p>Of course the part that made you chuckle is that Soriano sees himself as a hard worker, trying to improve his game on a daily basis.  The sad part is that a player entering his 14th MLB season, and his sixth season with the Cubs, that will earn nearly $20 million this year, does not see himself as a leader and doesn't want the added responsibility of being a leader to the youngsters of the organization.  Then again, perhaps we don't want him influencing the future of the organization.  </p>
