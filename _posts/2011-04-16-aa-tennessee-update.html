<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/04/Tennessee-Smokies.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5014" title="Tennessee Smokies" src="/uploads/2011/04/Tennessee-Smokies.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="190" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Chattanooga Lookouts&nbsp;and the rest of the Southern League had better look out because here come the Smokies!&nbsp;The Smokies are 5-2 heading into today's double header versus the Montgomery Biscuits.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/04/montgomery-biscuits-logo.gif"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5017" title="montgomery-biscuits-logo" src="/uploads/2011/04/montgomery-biscuits-logo-300x114.gif" alt="" width="300" height="114" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>This team exists.</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Smokies' roster is&nbsp;loaded with future big league players, and they are playing well together at the moment.&nbsp; Allow me to introduce--</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/04/Kevin-Mattison.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5016" title="Kevin Mattison" src="/uploads/2011/04/Kevin-Mattison.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="135" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kevin Mattison </strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, Kevin Mattison plays for the Jacksonville Suns, a division opponent.&nbsp; But the Smokies' roster features some talented players, such as Brett Jackson, Ryan Flaherty, Josh Vitters, Rebel Ridling, Jim Aducci, DJ LeMahieu, Steve Clevenger, Rafael Dolis, and Kyle Smit.&nbsp; We will no doubt see some of these guys in September, if not sooner.&nbsp; In fact, Corey wrote a post not too long ago about how some ridiculous fans were<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4885" target="_blank"> already clamoring to see Brett Jackson </a>in center field.&nbsp; What is crazy is that if you go to the Smokies' batting statistics page, <a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=t_ibp&amp;cid=553&amp;stn=true&amp;sid=t553" target="_blank">pretty much everyone is hitting over .300</a>.&nbsp; Of course, the numbers don't mean a whole lot this early in the season, but I think it is reasonable to say that this will be a strong offensive team.&nbsp; The team's potential weakness appears to be pitching if anything.&nbsp; However, the Smokies have an all-around strong roster and should be a contender to win the Southern League's North Division.&nbsp; It will be interesting to keep an eye on Vitters, Flaherty, Jackson, and company this season to see if they can keep the torrid offense going.</p></p>
