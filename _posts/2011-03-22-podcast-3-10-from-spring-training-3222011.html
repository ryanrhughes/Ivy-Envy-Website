<p>We took a tour of Chase Field and describe what the tour entails.  The Cubs traveled to Camelback Ranch to play the Dodgers.  We found it quite easy to be distracted by the absolutely gorgeous weather that the Valley of the Sun had today.  Also, in discussing our experience at Camelback Ranch, we realize that we enjoy people watching and analyzing about as much as watching baseball.  At the end of the episode, we tell you about an interview that we have coming up on tomorrow's episode.</p>
