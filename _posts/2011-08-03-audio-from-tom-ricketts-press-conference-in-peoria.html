<p>This afternoon, I had the privilege of participating in a press conference with Tom Ricketts, hosted by the Peoria Chiefs at O'Brien Field.  I'd like to thank Nathan Baliva and the rest of the staff at Peoria for continuing their acceptance of bloggers as members of the media.  </p>
<p>I plan to do a more in-depth post of the entire afternoon in the next few days, but I'd like to post the audio from the Tom Ricketts press conference.  The audio won't be great, but you should be able to hear everything.  </p>
