<p>We hosted our first event of 2010 on Monday at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline.&nbsp; We will be doing monthly events down there this season, and we kicked off the season with a live podcast recording.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d like to thank everyone that came down to watch the Cubs play the Nationals with us.&nbsp; I know it&rsquo;s difficult to get excited about a baseball team in April, especially when that team is playing below .500 baseball.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/ivyenvytwenty200-003.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2549" title="ivyenvytwenty200 003" src="/uploads/2010/04/ivyenvytwenty200-003-1024x767.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a></center></p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone that won prizes.&nbsp; Budweiser was on hand to do some games and give prizes away.&nbsp; <a href="www.sweetcheeksdiapercakeco.com" target="_blank">Sweet Cheeks Diaper Cake Company</a> had a Cubs cake on display and gave away a gift certificate.&nbsp; Jana S. won the Sweet Cheeks gift certificate, Dave R. won the Cubs umbrella, Christian S. won a Fukudome t-shirt and Tim won 4 tickets to any Peoria Chiefs game.&nbsp; We also gave away two sets of Cubs tickets for the upcoming series at Wrigley with Arizona.&nbsp; These were won by Sarah C. and Brian.&nbsp; Though Brian was sitting behind a mic for the evening, he was a guest and eligible to win the tickets, so accusations of tampering are unwarranted.</p>
<p>We were unexpectedly joined by about 75 French Canadians and their enthusiasm for Montreal playoff hockey really puts our early-season Cubs enthusiasm to shame.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if the Cubs make the playoffs this season, I guarantee that in October, Twenty will be louder and less Frenchy.</p>

Thanks again to everyone that came out.&nbsp; We owe a big thank you to our sponsors for their involvement with this event.&nbsp; Our next event at Twenty is on May 11<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; This will be a game-watch and we won&rsquo;t be recording a podcast.&nbsp; The Cubs are hosting the Florida Marlins that evening.&nbsp; Mark it on your calendar and we&rsquo;ll see you there.</p>
