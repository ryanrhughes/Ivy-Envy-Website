  content: I'm not sure about Harden, but Neil Cotts deserves some discussion. He
    came in the 8th inning and did strike a guy out after struggling to throw strikes.
    Then gave up a hit and walked the next guy on 4 pitches forcing Lou to bring in
    Marmol with a 5 run lead. Marmol saved him again. The guy can't throw strikes.

<p>If you listen to our podcast regularly, you're probably wondering where episode #5 is.  I was about to finish off the editing yesterday and upload it to the site and my external hard-drive fell of my desk.  It's not functional now and I'm hoping my 400-some cd's and 8 years of pictures can be salvaged.  </p>
<p>So I had to start over from scratch with the podcast and I hope to get it uploaded tonight.  </p>
<p>I spent most of the game last night in panic over this hard-drive, and ignored most of the Cubs game.  I didn't even have the volume up so I'm not sure if it was discussed on the tv or radio broadcasts, but am I crazy in thinking that if Harden wasn't due to come up in the bottom of the 6th, he would have been able to go out and pitch the 7th?</p>
