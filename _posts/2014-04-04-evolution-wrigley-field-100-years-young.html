Different decade promotions and jerseys scatter the Cubs schedule throughout the summer at the friendly confines.</p>
<p>I thought it would be cool, since it is the day of the home opener and the 100th year of baseball at Clark and Addison, to go through the history of Wrigley Field. I'll mark up some of the most memorable moments at Wrigley, the renovations, the different &nbsp;teams that played there, and all the other &nbsp;quirky pieces of information that we have come to know and love throughout the last century.</p>
<p>Lets begin in 1914. And contrary to popular belief, the Cubs weren't the original team that played at Wrigley. &nbsp;When it was built in the spring of 1914, which construction only lasted a little over 6 weeks, it was home to the Federal League's Chicago Whales. At the time, the name of the park was Weeghman park, and that was the name from 1914 to 1920. The Cubs moved in before the 1916 season and have been there ever since. The name change to Cubs Park in 1920, but has been Wrigley Field since 1926.</p>
<p>Wrigley has been renovated a few time throughout the ballpark's history. The first of which was an upper deck added to the park in 1927. One of the most famous portions of Wrigley was put up as the Cubs team president's son, Bill Veeck, put ivy on the outfield walls in 1937. Also in 1937, Veeck installed the famous scoreboard in center and the bleachers. Three years early, the marquee out in front of Wrigley was built and was painted blue until the 1960's when it was repainted to the familiar red. Another huge portion of renovating that Wrigley did was in 1988, where the Cubs became the last team to install lights in major league baseball.</p>
<p>A few different teams have called the friendly confines home. The Cubs, as mentioned before, have been called Wrigley home since 1916. Also as I mentioned before, the Chicago Whales played at Wrigley from 1914-15. Three NFL teams have played there, including the Chicago Tigers (1920), Chicago Cardinals (1931-39), and most famously the Chicago Bears from 1921 to 1970. Also, as a part of the North American Soccer League, the Chicago Sting had a stint where they called Wrigley home from 1977-1982 and again in 1984.</p>
<p>Wrigley Field has hosted World Series games in 1929, 1932, 1935, 1938, and 1945, playoff games in 1984, 1989, 1998, 2003, 2007, and 2008, but has never witnessed a Cubs championship as the Cubs won their two World Series championships before they moved to Wrigley. Other events that has taken place at Wrigley, besides baseball, are football games, soccer matches (both stated above), the 2009 Winter Classic hockey game, and a number of concerts including Pearl Jam and country singers Jason Aldean and Blake Shelton most recently.</p>
<p>Being built in 1914, Wrigley Field is the second oldest ballpark in the Major Leagues, as Fenway Park in Boston, built in 1912, is the oldest. The manual scoreboard, the marquee, and the ivy on the walls make Wrigley a great tourist destination and a great place to watch a ball game. It will be forever my favorite ballpark (bias included) and is my favorite place to be during the summer.</p>
