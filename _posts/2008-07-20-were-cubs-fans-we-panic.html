    Well, we started the season losing two straight before winning to avaid the sweep, and we ended the month with the most wins in April in team history.

    Go Cubs!

<p>Things haven't been so great since the All-Star Break.&nbsp; The Cubs have lost three games in a row and are in danger of being swept by the Astros.&nbsp; Usually when Zambrano takes the hill, he is the losing streak-buster.&nbsp; But when the only run the team scores is your own solo homerun, it's tough to the win.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't comment much on the last two games.&nbsp; Both nights, we have had friends that we haven't seen in a while over to our outdoor bar.&nbsp; The game has been on, but I haven't paid attention to these last two games as closely as I normally do.&nbsp; All I know is that <a id="more"></a><a id="more-136"></a>we are two games into the "second half" and our lead has been cut in half by two teams that, in my opinion, on paper do not appear to be as strong as the North Siders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to not panic.&nbsp; There is still a lot of baseball to be played.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that <a href="http://ivyenvy.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/where-the-cubs-stand-right-now/">1977 collapse</a>&nbsp;seems entirely possible for this year.&nbsp; That 92% chance of getting into the playoffs is <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/statistics/ps_odds.php">down to 85%</a> and only a Cubs fan could say "Those odds scare me".</p>
<p>But as for today, the Cubs need Ryan Dempster (10-4) to get his first win on the road for the season.&nbsp; My "W" Flag has not been flown in over a week and it's starting to collect dust.</p>
