<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt wrap up the off-season in this Chicago Cubs off-season.  We will have two bonus episodes for you before the next regular episode.  </p>
<p>* Friday, we'll be posting a discussion with Joe Martin.  Joe was part of a press event with the Cubs front office on their new Spring Training facilities in Mesa.  </p>
<p>* Monday is Opening Day and that morning, we'll post our 2013 predictions episode.  Every year we make some over/under guesses and then forget to go back and look at them at the end of the year.  We'll continue that in 2013.  </p>
<p>Our regular season episodes will be recorded and broadcast live on Sunday evenings at 8:30pm Central.  You can watch live and participate in the chat by going to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/live</a>.  </p>
<p>Also, for all of the information on our 200th episode party, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/200" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/200</a>.  We're throwing a big party and you're invited.</p>
<p>On this episode, we have to (of course) talk about Scott Baker and Ian Stewart.  Are you as fascinated with the Ian Stewart situation as Corey?  Probably not.  We also take questions from listeners:</p>
<p>* Is the general populace of Chicago Cubs fans the worst fans?<br />
* Which fantasy baseball format is better?<br />
* Considering Samardzija is a high point, who should the Cubs take in the NFL draft?<br />
* Should the Chicago Cubs World Series parade be downtown or in Wrigleyville?<br />
* How intensely/violent would fans react to a Cubs World Series?<br />
* What will the Chicago Cubs do with Marmol?</p>
<p>Then we talk a little about the idea of the Cubs moving to Rosemont.  We'd love to hear your opinions on this possibility.  Leave a comment on this post and tell us what you think.  </p>
<p>Corey reads some posts from the Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/facebookcubs" target="_blank">@FacebookCubs</a>.  Andy reads an internet muscle flex and Kurt calls out a big dog on the Cubs.com commenting areas.  Then we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  </p>
<p>As we get ready to kick off the regular season, we'd really appreciate it if you took a few seconds to give us a rating and review on iTunes.  <center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/itunes"><img data-id="8150"  src="/uploads/2013/01/ivyenvyitunes1-300x247.jpg" alt="ivyenvyitunes1" width="300" height="247" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8150" /></a></center></p>
