    the rotation. As we talked about on this week&#8217;s episode of the podcast,

<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the last week in Chicago Cubs Spring Training, specifically the Cubs games that have been televised in the last week.  What's up with James McDonald?  It's going to be tough seeing him step into the starting rotation when he can't seem to the plate.  Tsuyoshi Wada wasn't any easier to watch in Saturday's game.  Anthony Rizzo is quietly bouncing back from his 2013 performance.  We talk about the role Rizzo may play in the future compared to the role he's played these last few years.  </p>

This brings up the inevitable infield discussion with Emilio Bonafacio.  If Mike Olt wins the 3rd base job, what does that mean for Valbuena and Murphy and how does it impact the Bonafacio/Darwin Barney situation.  And really...what is going to happen to Darwin Barney?  Remember Starlin Castro?  Well, Kurt tells us what is going on with that 7-10 day injury that was now two weeks ago.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener questions on Mike Olt, pie, a possible snowed out Opening Day, Junior Lake, Travis Wood and Shawon Dunston Jr. </p>
<p>Corey talks about a real-life muscle flex and we read an internet muscle flex, submitted by Tim.  We read through the photo caption contests and choose Matt as the winner.  </p>
