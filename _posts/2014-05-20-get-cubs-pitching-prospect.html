<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Skulina.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9949" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Skulina-300x168.jpg" alt="Skulina" width="300" height="168" /></a>Saturday night in Kane County, 6&rsquo;5&rsquo;&rsquo; righty Tyler Skulina, combined with Nathan Dorris on a no-hitter, the 8<sup>th</sup> in Cougar history.</p>
<p>Skulina was the Cubs 4<sup>th</sup> round selection in the 2013 draft and was considered a coup for Chicago based on his 2<sup>nd</sup> round projection and middle-of-the-rotation potential.</p>
<p>The skills that back Skulina&rsquo;s substantial ceiling were on full display this weekend against the Quad Cities River Bandits (Astros). The big right-hander went 7.1 innings and fanned five while walking two batters. This was the first time Skulina had eclipsed the 6-inning mark as a professional.</p>
<p>With a solid three-pitch mix and college experience, Skulina could be a fast mover in the Cubs system, though he does have work to do as he climbs the ranks to Wrigley. While his 91-94 mph fastball will play at any level, but according to Baseball Prospectus, Skulina needs to continue developing his off-speed pitches as his arm speed is noticeably slower on change-ups than heaters&nbsp;and his slider can get &lsquo;slurvy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Eight starts into his 2014 campaign at Low-A, Skulina boasts a 3.19 ERA and 1.08 WHIP, though he has just 32 strikeouts in 42 frames.</p>
<p>Daytona may not be far off for Skulina and he&rsquo;ll have a friendly face waiting for him when he gets there; his no-hit partner, Nathan Dorris was promoted to High-A on Sunday.</p>
