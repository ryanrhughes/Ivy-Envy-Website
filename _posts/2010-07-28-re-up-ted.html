  content: "I think the Cubs strategy is going to be to \"go young\" and they do have
    some talent in the minors with pitchers.  Cashner should be a starter right now.
    \ So Lilly will probably be the first of veteran pitchers to start being tossed
    to the side.  \r\n\r\nThat said, Lilly and Dempster are great veteran guys to
    build around.  I still don't know how I feel about Randy Wells.  Silva....milk
    him for everything this season and ditch him in the offseason maybe?  He might
    have some value.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'd like to see in 2011:\r\n\r\nDempster
    (R)\r\nLilly (L)\r\nWells (R)\r\nMarshall (L)\r\nCashner (R)\r\n\r\nBut what do
    I know?\r\n\r\nI think that when Lilly ends up with a team, you have to let him
    go.  This is especially the case if he goes to a team like the Yankees.  If he
    goes to a team you don't mind, follow him like we followed Matt Murton.  Check
    in on him, but realize he's no longer a Cub."

  content: You make some good points... I would love to see Lilly be the veteran guy
    they build around.  I like the rotation you came up with, but I think Marshall
    should continue being a reliever.

<p style="text-align: left;">So the Cubs "win one for Ted" campaign failed miserably last night, and sadly enough, the game was probably Lilly's last as a Cub as he "<a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/07/werth-willingham-cantu-theriot.html" target="_blank">appears certain to be traded</a>."&nbsp; My opinion is that the Cubs need to re-up Lilly and look to unload payroll elsewhere.&nbsp; The problem is that Lilly is going to be the easiest contract to unload out of all of them.&nbsp; According to the Ted Lilly Fan Club, now that Dan Haren has been traded, Ted is the "<a href="http://tedlillyfanclub.blogspot.com/2010/07/with-haren-traded-to-angels-ted-lilly.html" target="_blank">Belle of the Ball</a>."&nbsp; So there is some demand for him, and most of the other players that the Cubs could potentially move have complications like full no-trade clauses (Lilly has a partial no-trade clause), money that the Cubs will have to eat, crumby seasons, etc.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Anyway, Ted Lilly could be part of the solution for this team going forward.&nbsp; He has been foundational to the success the team has had since 2007, posting "<a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100727&amp;content_id=12680830&amp;notebook_id=12681414&amp;vkey=notebook_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">a 47-34 record and a 3.73 ERA</a>."&nbsp; There has been a lot of talk about how Lilly has received "the least amount of run support in the Majors, as the Cubs have averaged 2.43 runs per start" (Muskat).&nbsp; That abysmal number is the reason for the 3-8 record this season.&nbsp; If the Cubs support Lilly with some offensive production, seasons like 2007 and 2008 happen, where he went 15-8 and 17-9 respectively.&nbsp; Though he has lost some velocity on his fastball, pure speed is not what makes Ted Lilly an effective pitcher.&nbsp; His effectiveness is due to the difference in speed between his fastball and his ridiculous curve/change-up, as well as his ability to locate his pitches.&nbsp; I think he is good for another three-year contract.&nbsp; With just over three days before the trade deadline, we don't have too much time to wait to see what happens.&nbsp; What do you do if your favorite player gets traded away from your favorite team?</p></p>
