    This one I'm sort of on the fence about.&nbsp; When you play 162 games a year, it's easy to get stressed out when you get maybe one day off in a month's time.&nbsp; There are a couple of arguments in both directions.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    Unless I'm missing something, we love to drink here at IvyEnvy.&nbsp; But you can't drink all of the time.&nbsp; The one angle I hear a lot is "Well, they make millions of dollars and they have all offseason to drink" which to me doesn't make any sense.&nbsp; If they just bottle all of their stress up the whole season long (excuse the pun) then by the time we miss the playoffs they'll just party from October to March, and then they'll be in worse physical shape.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    It's excess in moderation, much like anything else.&nbsp; Here again, this is the case for a 140 or even a 130 game season - if these guys got a day off now and then, then maybe's we'd be able to see better baseball.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    I think it's people's business what they are going to do in their off time, and technically when the press stuff is done after the game, they're off until they have to be at the park the next day.&nbsp; As a fan I do think we deserve a little bit better when it comes to production, but at the same time we have to respect their free time as well.

  content: And I do get that this is due much in part to the whole Red Sox tanking
    it in September 2011 thing.&nbsp; But you have to remember:&nbsp; That wasn't
    necessarily the nightlife...that was stuff that was going on in the clubhouse.&nbsp;
    Plus, I'm sure the players' union wouldn't be too thrilled if there was a guy
    assigned to watching every MLB player from the time he left the park to the time
    he showed up at the next game.&nbsp; Trust me, the union reps would throw a fit.&nbsp;

  content: I think it wouldn't be as big of a deal if the Cubs didn't play so many
    afternoon games.&nbsp; I don't know the specifics of a typical game-day ritual,
    but I would assume players would start arriving at the park around 9am.&nbsp;
    If they played more night games and the players didn't start arriving until 2pm
    or so, then it might not have that big of an effect.&nbsp;

  content: I would imagine this also wouldn't be as big of an issue if they Cubs weren't
    a complete mess.&nbsp; This is the time for a complete organizational overhaul
    and with the number of youngsters heading up, they might as well stress from the
    get-go, that they are there and getting paid to win ball games, not focus on the
    tail in the bars at night.&nbsp; I think it'll be more of an "expectation" than
    a rule.&nbsp;

    Right, but people of all ages and skill levels experience stress.&nbsp; And beer is such a part of the baseball culture it's hard to put it down when it comes to that.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    I know the Yankees have similar rules.&nbsp; With us it is different because we have a history of such poor results.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    As for the afternoon games, that's a good point and I didn't really think of that.&nbsp; I've heard some Mark Grace stories in my day that involved him not going to bed...just staying up all night and then headed to the park in the morning.&nbsp; And here again if there wasn't 162 games in a season, maybe this wouldn't happen.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    I do get that we're talking about guys with multimillion dollar contracts here, but like I said all types of people have to deal with stress.&nbsp; Imagine if your boss told you you had to work everyday for the next four weeks, what would you tell him?

    I think that the Red Sox situation set aside, with baseball if you did some sort of scientific study that compares the success of teams to their chemical intake, you'd likely find that it would be the same as the successful teams that had siginificantly stricter rules.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    I'm not defending the behavior, but it is what it is.

  content: This rule makes sense BECAUSE of the day games at Wrigley. I think having
    so many day games should be a part of the home field advantage. When other teams
    come to Chicago, they should be the ones hurting when they have to get up early
    and play, not the Cubs. In a perfect world, the players would understand this
    and police themselves. The rest of the world learns to not party every night when
    they have day jobs, so why can't the Cubs? This isn't a perfect world, and many
    of these guys are young, so it is a good idea to put the rules out there right
    away. There should be consequences if these guys go out until the wee hours and
    don't perform well the next day. For years, Chicago has been known as a party
    town for ballplayers because of the day games allowing them to go out at night,
    and that is a failure of the organization to not try and change that perception
    earlier. They won't even need to hire anybody to follow the guys, because this
    is the era of twitter and cellphone cameras, so anyone who sees these guys can
    rat them out. And they will. I think this is a step in the right direction to
    make this team a serious contender in the future.&nbsp;

<p>Cubs fans learned of another aspect of the change in culture with the organization that will be implemented this year.  Theo Epstein plans to reign in players in regards to their night-life.  In fact, he went so far as to call the organization's attitude towards the late-night hours up to this point, as a failure.  </p>
<p>Epstein attributes this lifestyle as a contributing factor in some of the failed Northside careers and a hinderance to the organization in it's quest for a World Series title.  With bars in the Wrigleyville area open until 4am, it's easy to see how that could impact someone playing a day game.  Not only does it negatively impact the play on the field, but as we've seen in this last off-season with Starlin Castro, there are other consequences.  </p>
<p>With a club that has some talented youth on the team, and a lot more of it to come in the next few years, this is a good time to implement policies like this.  In the past, players have ruled the Wrigley roost, but times have changed. </p>
<p>I love this clear organizational shift.  The emphasis being put on winning and getting to the point where winning can consistently happen is refreshing and should be encouraging to every Cubs fan.  I think we'll hear some criticisms of Ricketts/Epstein this year with a 2012 team that is most likely going to not only lose quite a few games, but also experience some growing pains as the youngsters start making their way up.  This is another piece of the foundation of the organization.  A foundation that has not existed and needs to be built if the Cubs want to sustain anything.  </p>
