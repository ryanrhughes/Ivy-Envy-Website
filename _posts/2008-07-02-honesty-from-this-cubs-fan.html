<p>I posted the following in my personal blog on Opening Day.&nbsp; I had been waiting for the right time to put it on Ivy Envy, but that time didn't present itself, mainly because the Cubs are sitting 16 games over .500.&nbsp; But things have looked shaky lately, so here it is...Honestly from&nbsp;this Cubs fan.</p>
<p>______________________</p>
<p>The temperature struggles to hit 40 degrees and a blanket of cold rain smothers the Midwest. It must be opening day for Major League Baseball. I am a Cubs fan.&nbsp; I root for the team that has now gone 100 years without winning the World Series.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the type of Cubs fan that is optimistic about an upcoming season, but before the ivy has turned green and the first pitch has even been thrown out, I have already prepared myself for a disastrous outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen teams fall apart. I&rsquo;ve seen teams under-achieve in monumental ways. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-117"></a>I&rsquo;ve also seen teams over-achieve, only to have my hopes dashed in scenarios that are of biblical proportion. It&rsquo;s all character building and probably makes up a good portion of who I am today.</p>
<p>For some reason, when I was 6 or 7 years old, I looked at the unforgiving pain inflicted upon family members and friends by the Loveable Losers from the North Side and decided I wanted to continue that pain for another generation. I will encourage my children to embrace this history, too. It is their duty.</p>
<p>I am now 30 years old and they appear to be no closer to a World Series ring now than they were 30 years ago. It used to seem like a ridiculous notion that I would not see the Cubs win a World Series in my lifetime. It is becoming a reality.</p>
<p>But there is safety in losing. Since this losing, and usually it&rsquo;s in a painful manner, has become part of who I am, it almost feels unnatural when the Cubs win. I thought they had a chance to make it to the World Series last year, and while I was excited to see my team have a chance to win it all, it just didn&rsquo;t feel right. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I want to see the Cubs win. I just feel a little bit safer when they lose. It&rsquo;s almost like the universe is in sync when the Cubs lose.</p>
<p>If they won, people who used to make fun of the Cubs, and me for following them, would wear cubbie blue and celebrate a championship. These are the people that jump on any bandwagon, and a historic bandwagon would be the ultimate. I don&rsquo;t want to see those people wear Cubs hats or even talk about the Cubs in a positive manner. These are my Cubs. We lose and that makes us the ultimate non-fairweather fans. We are optimists that love our team. We root for them to win, but at least in my case, I feel safe with each loss, as long as that loss is painful.</p>
