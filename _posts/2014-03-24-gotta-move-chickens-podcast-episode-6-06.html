  content: Not freaking out or anything.  It doesn't show up in Pocket Casts.  Just
    an FYI.  If there's normally a delay, just ignore me.

  content: Yeah, there will be a slight delay.  There's a long explanation that involves
    pinging and iTunes, blah blah blah.

    hiking trail just outside Seattle.

  content: "[&#8230;] Jason Parks from Baseball Prospectus has compared Baez to Miguel
    Cabrera and Kurt mentioned that in this week&#8217;s episode of our podcast. Being
    the power-hitter he is, I would expect Baez to continue to bulk [&#8230;]"

<p>I want to apologize for delayed release and the drop in sound quality with this episode.  The audio file was corrupt and I had to rip the audio from our live broadcast.  </p>
<p>Next week we will record our 2014 Season Predictions episode, so on this episode, we start wrapping up Cubs 2014 Spring Training.  We start things off by identifying the biggest surprises and biggest disappointments this Spring.  One of the main story-lines that has developed this spring is Mike Olt.  We talk about his offense, his defense, whether he should break camp with the Cubs, and if he does, how that will effect the roster and the infield.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WINNER-4.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/WINNER-4-300x300.png" alt="WINNER (4)" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9279" /></a>Javier Baez has been sent down the minor league camp.  We talk about where he fits defensively with the Cubs.  Corey makes the case for Baez playing second base and Kurt compares Baez to Miguel Cabrera.  </p>
<p>Arrieta's fifth spot in the rotation has not yet been filled and we look at Chris Rusin and Carlos Villanueva and consider why each pitcher should be given that spot in the rotation.  This leads into a discussion on the bullpen.  With the departure of Blake Parker from the major league roster, we look at what the bullpen will look like in a week when the Cubs open up the 2014 season in Pittsburgh.  </p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions, crown an Asshat of the Week, read an Internet Muscle Flex and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>On this episode, I talked about our Patreon campaign.  You can check it out by going to:  <a href="http://patreon.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">http://patreon.com/ivyenvy</a></p>
