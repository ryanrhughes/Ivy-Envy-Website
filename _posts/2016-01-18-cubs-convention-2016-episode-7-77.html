The event took place this last weekend in Chicago and Corey was there and he shares his experience from #CrazyHatLady to the Business Operations meeting, to a kid screaming how much he hates the Cardinals at Theo, Jed and the rest of the room to Cubs Bingo.  We talk about it all. </p>
<p>Jake Arrieta and the Cubs have exchanged numbers and now have the task of coming to an agreement or going to arbitration. We'll talk about how far apart the two parties are and how we think this will play out.  </p>
