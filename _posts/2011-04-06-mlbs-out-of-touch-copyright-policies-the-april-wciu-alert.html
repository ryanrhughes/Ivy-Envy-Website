    WCIU game let's do a listening party in the back yard. Pat and Keith on WGN radio!"

  content: I can't stand WCIU. I even asked the Cubs front office about it at the
    Cubs Convention last year. They fed me some line like those games are reserved
    for ESPN. That doesn't answer the question why not all of those are actually on
    ESPN. Some are, but sometimes the stupid blackouts screw up and the game is blacked
    out on ESPN. Craig Kenney explained it to me, but the process of making sure the
    game isn't blacked out is pretty convoluted.

  content: "What drives me crazy is the fact that there should be no such thing as
    a blackout if I'm a subscriber to MLB Extra Innings. You've got my money, now
    show me the games. \r\n\r\nI also hate those \"exclusive\" agreements. Again,
    I'm paying the freight here. Don't take my money and then tell me I am forced
    to watch the goddamn Yankees every Saturday afternoon because of Fox."

    and eventually stop watching games?  Just think if we were a Cardinals/Brewers/Royals/Twins
    fan in the Quad Cities.  You buy MLB.TV and every one of your games is blacked
    out because you are within 6 hours of the city? \r\n\r\nRidiculous."

    the games that start after 6pm are broadcast, but all the afternoon games are
    controlled by FOX.

  content: It's all about money. The MLB makes the exclusive agreements and we pay.
    I hate the notion that the leagues have (all of them) that the games are interchangeable.
    That I would want to watch a baseball game just because it's a baseball game when
    the game I really want to watch is blacked out. This and the dumb 6 team blackout
    area we live in when we don't live closer than 160 miles to any one team are the
    reasons I've avoided signing up for MLB TV for many years. I had the basketball
    package about 10 years ago when MJ came back and played for the Wizards. They
    had it right. Every game was on and no blackouts other than when the Bulls were
    Comcast (I think it was FSN then). The Bulls games that were on WGN (whether Chicago
    or Nationwide) were not blackout out.

  content: "The NFL has similar blackout policies but we are not subject to them in
    the Quad Cities.  It happens in areas like Buffalo or Jacksonville where they
    are having a problem selling tickets to begin with.  \r\n\r\nIt is totally ridiculous
    for them to keep doing this especially when you do pay money for a premium service
    as John mentioned earlier.  It's OUR money.  \r\n\r\nI'm really hoping that once
    Selig is gone a lot of the old money that's controlling baseball will be forced
    to accept how the media has changed.  I think people ARE willing to pay for a
    premium service, but you have to guarantee that people can see absolutely everything.
    \ \r\n\r\nTo Corey's point, as to whether or not people will stop watching, maybe
    the length of the season is the problem here.  Think about it...There's 162 baseball
    games a year, it's a lot easier for the execs to accept and for the fans to stomach
    if they only miss about eight or nine games...It's all a matter of percentages.
    \ In the same scenario, if you blacked out 6 NFL games during a season, there
    would be thousands of people with torches at the cable company because there's
    only 16 games a year.  (at least for now)  But no, I don't think people are going
    to stop watching, but maybe a petition is right, and so is Scott.  \r\n\r\nExcellent
    discussion thread.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The life of a Cubs fan is filled with a lot of frustrations.  This is not a new theme.  Generations of Cubs fans before have experienced the same frustrations.  My biggest frustration with the Cubs doesn't even have to do with the team on the field.  It has to do with the out-of-touch, money grubbing big-wigs with Major League Baseball.  The Cubs hand over the broadcast of their games to WCIU 8 times in 2011.  If you're in Chicago, you're probably thinking it's no big deal.  Well, for any Cubs fan in the Midwest that doesn't live in Chicago-land, it's a big deal.  It is impossible to tune into these games.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I thought I had figured out a solution to this problem.  I subscribed to MLB Extra Innings through Direct TV.  The first WCIU broadcast was scheduled and I invited fellow Cubs fans over to the backyard to watch game.  MLB considers us to be part of the Chicago broadcast region and blacked out this game.  During that summer, if a Cubs game was on WCIU, the best I could do was pull up the Game Channel or whatever they call the station that has all the games in small screens on the same channel.  If I highlighted the visitor's feed, I could hear the other team's broadcast....on a screen about 1"x1".</p>
<p>Major League Baseball is so behind the times with copyrighting issues.  Try to find a baseball highlight on Youtube.  They are pulled down instantly.  Why?  You would think that baseball would realize this is free advertising of their brand.  Why not allow people to look up the best plays in the history of the game?  It makes no sense to me.  I was talking with Scott Morschhauser, our official source of everything Pittsburgh Pirates at our game-watch yesterday and he said that he e-mails MLB frequently and consistently tells them his theory and I think he's dead right.  He said, "With the younger generations, you have to give them what they want, when they want it, on the device they want it on."  He said he subscribes to the MLB.TV package, but is unable to watch the games on his computer when the Pirates play the Cubs.  He said, "If it's an advertising issue, then show me WGN's feed with their ads."</p>
<p>I just don't understand why baseball continues to screw the fan over with all these little cracks for us to fall into.  Thursday was Opening Day for the Cardinals and I got home from work and flipped on the tv to see how the Cardinals were doing.  ESPN and MLB had the game blacked out.  Here in the Quad Cities, we are 5 hours from St. Louis.  We aren't anywhere near the St. Louis broadcast area.  If I was a Cardinals fan in the Quad Cities, I would have been pretty steamed that someone in Montana could watch their first game of the season, but I couldn't because I'm just a little too close (but not really) to St. Louis.  Ok...I'll stop showing empathy for Cardinals fans now.</p>
<p>So for those of us in the Quad Cities, we will be unable to watch 5% of the total games this year.  Eight games are on WCIU with two of those in April.  At least the first game of the year isn't on WCIU, like last year.  However, the last game of the season is on WCIU.  So imagine the Cubs are in the battle for the division and it comes down to the last game.  If you live in the Midwest, but not in Chicago, you're not watching that game.  You're not even going to a sports bar to watch that game because they won't be able to get it with their MLB Extra Innings package.</p>
<p>April 15th is tax day and a Friday.  You'll turn your taxes in feel relief in that they are done...and it's Friday!  The work week is done.  Crack open a cold one and sit back and watch the Cubs take on the Rockies out in Denver.  Nope, think again.  You'll flip to WGN, then CSN.  Then you'll think "Oh, it's on CSN+.  Where is that stupid channel again?"  Nope, not there.  "Hmm, must be on ESPN for some reason. Nope? Well, it's got to be on the MLB Network.  Good thing I have Direct TV and not Mediacom."  It's not there.  You're out of luck.  It's on WCIU.</p>
<p>Like I said, we won't be able to watch total of 8 games, which is 5% of the season.  For some reason, half of these WCIU games are games in which the Cubs play the Reds.  Because of WCIU, I will not be able to watch nearly 30% of the Cubs vs. Reds games this year.  That's why I didn't challenge Brian over at <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo's Goggles</a> to a bet this year.  I need to see a game to know the results I read are accurate.</p>
<p>So let me give you advanced notice, the two April WCIU games are 4/15 vs the Reds and 4/18 vs. the Padres.  I know it won't do any good, but write letters to the Cubs and/or MLB.  Use the exact quote that Scott uses in his letters.  Maybe if they read it enough, they'll start understanding that this stuff is not only a big deal to the fans, but the livelihood of their product could depend on it.</p>
