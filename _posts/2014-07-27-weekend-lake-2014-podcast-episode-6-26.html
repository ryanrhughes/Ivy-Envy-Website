This weekend was our now annual party, the Ivy Envy Weekend at the Lake.  Although the Cubs lost to the Cardinals on Saturday, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves (and the $5 pitchers of Old Style) at Duffy's.  </p>
<p>The Darwin Barney era is over and we reflect on "the grizzled Cub veteran".  We believe most Cubs fans view Barney the same we do.  Although there is a group of Cubs fans that apparently feel like the Cubs have just let Lou Brock go...no really, you'll hear it in the Internet Muscle Flex segment of the show.  </p>
<p>Jorge Soler was promoted from Double-A Tennessee to Triple-A Iowa.  Hype is starting to build for Soler and we talk about why he is on a different track than the other prospects in the Cubs system.  In the podcast, we reference an article that John from Cubs Den wrote, <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-den/2014/07/jorge-soler-or-javier-baez-who-has-the-higher-ceiling-and-who-would-your-rather-have/" target="_blank">you can check it out here</a>. </p>
<p>Albert Almora was promoted from High-A Daytona to Double-A Tennessee.  We talk a little about Almora, but really use the opportunity to talk about the progress of the prospects.  Within a few years, the Cubs have gone from exciting prospects at the lowest levels of the system to those exciting prospects being at the higher levels of the organization, with no real drop-off from any so far.  </p>
<p>We have a slew of listener questions and Kurt gives us a Junior Lake Scary Stat of the Week.</p>
<p>This week's photo for the caption contest was the most well received, and probably the best there's been in the history of us doing these things.  We got over 50 entries and at the end of it all, decided they are all too good to choose just one.  </p>
