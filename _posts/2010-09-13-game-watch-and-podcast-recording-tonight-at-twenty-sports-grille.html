<p>We will have our last event of this miserable 2010 season tonight at Twenty Sports Grille in downtown Moline.  Come on down and watch the Cubs/Cardinals game with us.  We'll be recording a podcast episode, so bring an opinion and jump on the mic with us.  </p>
<p>Also, courtesy of Twenty and Bud Light, the first 30 people will get one of these.<br />

<p>Twenty is located at 1405 5th Ave in Moline.  They have great food, so come down hungry and thirsty.  </p>
