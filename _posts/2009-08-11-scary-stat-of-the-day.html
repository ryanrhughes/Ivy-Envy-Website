  content: "Yeah last night's game was wierd... I actually had to quit watching it,
    and I usually watch most games to the end no matter what.  Man did Soriano look
    so slow getting to that ball hit by Tulowitski.  That is maddening to watch as
    a fan.  I don't know if the injuries he's had are affecting him, but at this point,
    I want him to say so.  I want to know if there is a physical reason for the lack
    of hustle.  \r\n\r\nI'm surprised Miles has not been released.  I would platoon
    Font and Baker the rest of the year at 2nd if possible."

<p>Aaron Miles has played in 50 games this season.&nbsp; You might think that his .197 average is pretty frightening, but I think Miles' scariest stat is his 4 RBI's this season.&nbsp; For some reason, Lou brought him in last night to pinch hit with the bases loaded.&nbsp; He could have doubled his RBI total with one swing of the bat, but Miles held true to form and hit a soft and lazy liner to Troy "I'll stretch a double hit to Soriano into a triple any day and show you Cubs how a baseball player hustles" Tulowitzki.&nbsp; If you needed to be reminded, it's August.&nbsp; It's nearly the middle of August and Aaron Miles has no homeruns and 4 RBI's.&nbsp; So if Miles played every game this season, at the current rate, he might have 9 or 10 RBI's on the year.</p>
<p>Derosa has 21 HR's and 63 RBI's.&nbsp; I'm just saying....Aaron Miles sucks.</p>
