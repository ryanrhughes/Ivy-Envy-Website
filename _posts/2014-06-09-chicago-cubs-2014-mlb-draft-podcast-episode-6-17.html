<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt recap the first few rounds of the 2014 draft for the Chicago Cubs. We look at Kyle Schwarber, Jake Stinnett and Mark Zagunis and talk about the strategy that the Cubs are employing to sign those players under-slot and then use those savings to offer some of the pitchers they drafted in the following rounds more enticing deals.</p>
<p>We talk about the recent success the Cubs have experienced on the field, winning 5 of their last 6 games. Corey's Scary Stat of the Week involves this little run and when the last time was that we saw something similar. Kurt's Scary Stat involves Mike Olt aka "Olty" and his struggles.</p>
<p>We wrap up the show by reading internet muscle flexes on the draft.</p>
