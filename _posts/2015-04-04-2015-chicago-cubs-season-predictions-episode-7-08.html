    88 wins
    Over on Bryant espn mentions
    Like Andy Apr 20th or the start of the next series on Friday (too many central div games not to call him up
    Bryant over on HR, 38
    Under on bryant billboard dingers, 0
    Baez under 130 games, 108 but also think he could be traded
    Under on Baez stranded runners, if he struggles like that he won't be there.
    Russell call up Aug.6th in SF. Same week they called up Javy, and my bday.
    If anyone hits the jumbotron its Jorge Soler
    1 dinger off scoreboard, it looks like maybe 430ft+ to hit going too be hard
    All stars 5. Lester, Soler, Castro, Rizzo, Arrietta, Bryant if up in April
    Over on players earning saves
    Over on extra inning wins
    Over on pitchers used, possible trades and 5th starter options
    I'm going over on Rondon saves, think we're in trouble if he's not
    Over on iTunes reviews 24
    Under on Arrietta no hitter to 7th, but think he throws one this year
    Over on AA positions played
    Under on Maddon pinch hit with a pitcher
    Under on players on roster
    0 Ejax starts, if he starts its a bad year 3 Ross HR
    Castro under batting avg .280
    Rizzo under 30hrs, seems to be struggling this spring
    Soler leads team with Hr, if Rizzo hits 30 then 3 players with 30hr
    Under Montero WAR, too many catchers
    Over on Lester throws to 1st
    Over on Maddon ejections
    Under on whatever hot feet is
    To add i think they trade for Cole Hamels at trade deadline which moves a SS and makes room for Russell.  Moving Javy or Castro.  They make it to playoffs on wildcard and lose in NL division series
