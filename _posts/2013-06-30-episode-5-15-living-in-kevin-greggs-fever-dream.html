<p>On this episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast, we start things off by reflecting on the the Carlos Marmol era.  We saw some very good years and some very bad years.  How will we remember Marmol?  Ian Stewart is finally released by the Cubs.  The rumors are that the Diamondbacks and possibly other teams are interested in trading for Jeff Samardzija.  We talk about what it would take for us to be ok with a Jeff Samardzija trade.  </p>
<p>Then we get into some questions from listeners.  Should the Cubs send Starlin Castro to Iowa and bring up Junior Lake?  When would the Cubs have received the most in a trade for Carlos Marmol and what is the most the current regime could have gotten for him? What could the Cubs potentially get for Kevin Gregg in a trade?  Who might be in the Cubs starting rotation at the end of the season?</p>
<p>Then Kurt sends Ian Stewart packing with one last scary stat and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
