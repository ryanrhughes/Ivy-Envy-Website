    one. No hindsight needed... my mother could have seen this coming. 10 years, 7
    teams. Who will be stupid enough to be #8?'

  content: '...on the other hand, we have to look for a reason the cubs didn''t perform
    this season. Clearly they had the talent. This blog has often cited the fact that
    DeRosa is no longer a presence in the clubhouse as a detrimental factor to the
    team. Maybe Bradley is right. Maybe guys like Soriano with a "say die as soon
    as it gets tough" attitude have something to do with the fact that a team with
    such immense talent couldn''t come together and do something with a season in
    which there was very little competition in their division. Obviously Bradley has
    some issues, but you have to admit he gave it all on the field.'

  content: "There is an article on Cubs.com (http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090920&content_id=7068578&vkey=news_chc&fext=.jsp&c_id=chc)
    that makes it pretty clear this suspension isn't just about Bradley's recent comments.
    Hendry has also shown in his statements that things have been happening all season
    and apparently been kept under wraps. Bradley's Chicago hatin' comments were the
    last straw. BTW, Derosa made $5.5 million this year and has 21 hr and 71 RBI all
    while adjusting to two new teams. Bradley, $10 million, 12 hr, 40 RBI and the
    Cubs still owe him $20 million.\r\n\r\nBaseball is all about paying for what could
    be. How about paying up for a guy who is a known entity and will do whatever you
    ask of him?\r\n\r\nOh, and why couldn't this happened on Friday so we had something
    to talk about on the podcast?"

  content: I was amazed at how none of the other players seem to have Bradley's back
    in that article you linked, Kurt.  Well, not amazed, but I thought Bradley would
    at least have had one friend in the clubhouse.  He was an island in there.  That
    is crazy that he seemed to make no effort to make any friends.

  content: Ouch.  Not sure what I did to deserve that quiet pot shot.. but I actually
    agree with everything you said, Corey.. I have tried hard to defend him all this
    year, but he's made it absolutely impossible..

<p>Ok, so I'm a little late to this party.&nbsp; I've defended him for the entire season for two reasons.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Milton Bradley has abilities.&nbsp; He's a good baseball player and he could contribute to the Cubs.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Fans are idiots and they were heckling him during Spring Training.&nbsp; We're talking exhibition while he was playing well.</p>
<p>The whole season, I was just thinking that if the fans could get off his back, Bradley would perform and feel at home.&nbsp; That's of course ignoring the elephant in the room.&nbsp; Bradley is a head-case and has, as far as I know, played in every city with a chip on his shoulder.&nbsp; This is no longer the "loveable losers".&nbsp; The days of "Yeah, they aren't that good and they have flaws, but gosh darnit, they're our guys and I'll stand by them" are over.</p>
<p>I can't defend him any longer.&nbsp; I can't defend a guy that criticizes an organization and fans that gave him a $30 million contract for being negative.&nbsp; This is not a principled stand against some evil corporation.&nbsp; This is a game.&nbsp; I can't defend a guy that claims this negativity is why the Cubs haven't won in 100 years.&nbsp; There are lots of fans of teams that are tough on their players.&nbsp; New York and Philadelphia come to mind.&nbsp; Last time I checked, they hadn't gone 100 years without winning.&nbsp; Maybe Tim could give us a Yankees fan's perspective.</p>
<p>Bradley is wasting years of potential by being a general asshat.&nbsp; I'm done defending him.&nbsp; He crossed the line.&nbsp; There are rules, this isn't 'Nam.&nbsp; The Milton Bradley experiment has been a miserable failure and I would imagine we will eat a lot of that contract.&nbsp; And, we have mud on our faces.&nbsp; Either we're the idiots for being hard on a guy that doesn't have terrible numbers, or we're idiots for taking a chance with him.</p>
<p>This really is the perfect ending for this season.&nbsp; It's a fine example of the whole season.&nbsp; What a disaster!&nbsp; It sure feels like Hendry did more than "tinker" with last year's team, huh?</p>
