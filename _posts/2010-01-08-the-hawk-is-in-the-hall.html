<p>We are a little late with this, but we would still like to express our satisfaction that Andre Dawson was elected into the Hall of Fame.&nbsp; I have a weak opposition to the Hall of Fame, which I briefly explain in the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1609">25th episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast</a>.&nbsp; But I'm happy to see Dawson get in.&nbsp; In honor of his induction, I will hang a poster of Dawson that is framed in glass in the backyard pub, which is where the majority of the Ivy Envy Podcasts are recorded.&nbsp; I've had this since 1988 and I am happy to finally give it a proper place to hang.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't care if Dawson goes in as a member of the Expos or the Cubs.&nbsp; We have fond memories of him and I'm sure there are a few people in Montreal that ever knew who Dawson was.&nbsp; I will always remember him in blue pinstripes with a red "C" on his hat.&nbsp; I doubt that Dawson gets in without those six years he spent on the Northside and that's good enough for me.</p>
