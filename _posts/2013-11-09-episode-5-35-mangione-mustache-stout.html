<p>On this episode, we focus on the hiring of the Cubs new manager, Rick Renteria.  Other topics we discuss include the Cubs parting ways with WGN, Keith Moreland parting ways with the Cubs, and your hosts parting ways with smooth upper lips and chins.  </p>
<p>Internet muscle flexes make an appearance, and we turn back the clock to the Chicago White Stockings for our scary stat.  The caption contest features an image of Rick Renteria.</p>
