In the last week the Cubs have signed two veteran pitchers, 38 year old righty Ramon Ortiz and 35 year old lefty Doug Davis. Both will start with the Iowa Cubs. Ortiz has already started one game for the I-Cubs and pitched well in a no decision, striking out 7 in 5 innings. Davis has some work to do on extending his pitch count before he'll join the team.</p>
<p>According to Jim Hendry these moves are "A good type of insurance." He went on to claim that the Cubs would have made these deals even if Cashner and Wells had not been put on the DL. The conspiracy theorist Cubs fan could read into this, but I think Hendry is telling the truth. You can never have too many arms ready. If it turns the Cashner and/or Wells prognosis is worse than expected maybe we won't have to endure another Russell/Samardzija platoon experiment. I'm guessing the Cubs would rather leave the relievers in the bullpen and be prepared when the next injury bug bites.</p>
