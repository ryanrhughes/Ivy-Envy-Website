  content: Loved hearing the audio on that home run. That ball came right at me, Danny
    Rockett, and Arty Bouchez where we were standing in right center. It was pretty
    great.

<p>He is who we thought he was. Or rather, in just one game, Javier Baez displayed a lot of what Cubs fans and prospect buffs everywhere expected to see in the early stages of his Big League career- though maybe not all in his first&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>Javy swung out of his shoes, early and often. He struck out, early and often &ndash; thrice, to be specific. He made hard contact to all fields. He played suitable middle infield defense. And, most importantly, he delivered with the bat late.</p>
<p>The precocious 21 year-old smacked the eventual game-winning homer in his sixth at-bat of the night, belabored not by the fact that he was 0-5 as he stepped into the box, an impressive feat for any player, let alone a rookie with the (admittedly unfair) weight of an organization&rsquo;s future on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The OppoTaco came in the 12<sup>th</sup> inning of a tied game, the first go-ahead, extra-innings homer by a player making his MLB debut since some dude&nbsp;named Miguel Cabrera did it in 2003. The blast gave the Cubs the lead, and eventually, after Carlos Villanueva slammed the door on the Rockies in the bottom half of the frame, it gave Chicago the win.</p>
<p>Most memorably, Baez, in just his first MLB game, gave Cubs fans hope for&nbsp;what&rsquo;s to come.</p>
