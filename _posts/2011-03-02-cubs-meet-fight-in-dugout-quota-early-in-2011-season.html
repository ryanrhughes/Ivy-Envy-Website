  content: "First off, Ryno ISN'T the manager, and if we can't get over that fact
    it's going to be a long season.\r\n\r\nI'm not nearly as negative about Silva
    as Corey is.   I think he can put together something impressive.  Not AS impressive
    as what we saw last year, but a decent year.  \r\n\r\nThe errors are meaningless
    to me at this point.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>I'm sure you've seen by now, but Carlos Silva and Aramis Ramirez got into a scuffle in the Cubs dugout at Maryvale Baseball Park in Phoenix today during a game with the Milwaukee Brewers.  While Silva has not yet discussed the situation publicly, it's safe to assume that he might be wound a little tight, knowing that he is fighting for one of the two open slots in the starting rotation.  My guess is that Carlos wanted to make a good first impression and pitch well in his first Spring Training appearance.</p>
<p>Silva was pulled after the scuffle, and I'm not sure if he would have returned if the scuffle hadn't happened.  Silva's 1 inning performance didn't provide and impressive looking pitching line: 1.0 IP, 3H, 6R, 3ER, 1BB, 0K, 2HR.  But it wasn't necessarily his poor performance that led to the throwdown in the dugout.  In that one inning, the Cubs infield committed three errors.  One of these errors was a dropped fly ball by Aramis Ramirez.  The Cubs went on to commit two more errors, one of which was Ramirez's second error of the game.  It's never good to end a game with more errors than base-hits.</p>
<p>I think Cubs fans are probably more concerned with the 5 errors today and 14 errors in the first four games of Spring Training than they are with a pitcher that people had no expectations for, a year ago.  To be honest, I'm not REAL concerned with either issue.</p>
<p>Let me start with Silva, he's not that good.  He got off to a good start in 2010 and it was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.  There's a reason that the Mariners were eager to give the Cubs Silva AND cash for the guy we did not think the Cubs would ever be able to unload, Milton Bradley.  The Cubs got more than they expected out of Silva and I don't think we'll see him perform like that again.  I hope I'm wrong and Silva can put together a good season in 2011.  I don't have much hope for him and I doubt he's winning over anyone with the Cubs by making statements like he did at Cubs Convention, saying that it's "ridiculous" he has to earn a rotation spot.</p>
<p>Now, to the errors.  Cubs fans are flipping out about the 14 errors in  the first four games of Spring Training.  In my job, I get summers off  (great gig for a baseball fan) and I can assure you, those first few  days in August, I am completely out of sorts.  If I had to take a phone  call I'd probably sound like a bumbling idiot trying to remember the  information, that this time of the year, I recite without thinking.  I  don't doubt that players have been practicing pop-ups and ground-balls  since they reported to Spring Training, but game-speed is surely  different.  They are rusty.  That's what Spring Training is for...to get  back into the routine and the flow of things.  When I report back to  work, I don't actually go out and do my job for a few days.  I take a  few days to get settled in and just do the small things to get organized  for the year.  If the Cubs are committing errors in these numbers in three weeks, then we really have something to be concerned about.  My guess is that the Cubs players will settle down and get comfortable in their defensive spots in the next week and these errors will be long forgotten by April 1st.</p>
<p>I'm not saying we should just dismiss these miscues and ignore them.  I think they are worth noting.  I have to admit, though, I do feel more comfortable with a manager that has spent his entire career coaching fundamentals to minor league baseball players at the helm.  Quade has said that there will be a club meeting tomorrow to address the scuffle and the errors.</p>
<p>I've already read <a href="http://kentsterling.com/2011/03/02/its-cubs-manager-mike-quades-time-to-earn-your-money-after-ramirez-silva-dugout-fight/" target="_blank">some people criticizing Quade</a> for his apparent "boys will be boys" attitude.  I am not in Mesa (yet) and the Cubs have not been on tv for me to see his demeanor, but I'm not ready to get on Quade yet.  Scheduling a club meeting the day after these occurrences is more than we ever saw from Lou Piniella.  The author of the article I linked believes Ryne Sandberg would "never let anyone get away with this nonsense."  I really hope we don't hear speculation on how Ryno would handle every situation during Quade's tenure.  We are three games into Spring Training, after Lou's handling of situations, I think Quade seems pretty on-the-ball.</p>
<p>I have to admit though, I can see how Silva might be frustrated.  His career is at a crossroads and he will either end up in the starting rotation or the bullpen, which means he may never start again.  It probably won't take many bad starts in Spring Training to get pushed out of contention for the starting spots.  But Silva should learn from Zambrano's mistakes and know that reactions like this aren't the avenues to take to make your case.</p>
