We talk about the positives and negatives performances (team and individual player) this season.  We each give a scary stat of the season, name an Asshat of the Season, give our picks for the playoffs and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
<p>If you found our podcast this season, thank you so much for finding us.  We continue this podcast during the off-season and we will keep you up to date with all of the Cubs news.  </p>
