excerpt: 'Thirty-three games left.&nbsp; Can the Cubs win 100 games for the first
  time since ''35?&nbsp; I think it is well within the realm of possibility.&nbsp;
  We still aren''t out of the woods yet as far as the NL Central race is concerned,
  but every day the promised land gets closer and closer.&nbsp; In my opinion, the
  Cubs are almost a lock to win the pennant.&nbsp; It''s when you start to look at
  how the Cubs match up with potential World Series foes that things get interesting.&nbsp;
  But this team is certainly capable of defeating all foes, Ivan Drago style.&nbsp;

    Their current winning percentage is .615.
    .615 x 162=99.63
    Close enough for me. Considering they are much improved on the road and are up to .500 (31-31) and +30 at home I think 100 will happen.

<p>Today's win was fun/encouraging to watch for several reasons.&nbsp; Harden owned the gnats.&nbsp; The first at bat of the game set the tone--He started off with pitches in the high eighties and proceeded to touch the nineties.&nbsp; Harden then notched his first strikeout with an 84 mph change-up that faded off the corner of the plate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a pinch-hit appearance, Fukudome hit a two-run homer.&nbsp; It was funny how Len and Bob kept talking about how Gerald Perry&nbsp;was trying to emphasize the need for Fukudome to forget about homers and just focus on making good contact.&nbsp; Well, he made pretty good contact today, and hopefully this indicates a moribund slump.</p>
<p>DeRosa is tearing it up.&nbsp; Today's solo shot marked his fourth straight game with a homer, and now with every subsequent homer he will set a new single season P.R.</p>
<p>This is the team and the year.</p>
