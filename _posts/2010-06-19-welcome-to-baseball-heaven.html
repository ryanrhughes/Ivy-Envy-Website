  left;\">My wife and I had the pleasure of attending the first game of the Cubs-Angels
  series yesterday.&nbsp; The Miller Lite billboard beyond right field read, \"Welcome
  to baseball heaven.\"&nbsp; After watching the horrible defensive play of the Cubs
  yesterday (and really for a while now), I'm not ready to come to the conclusion
  that heaven is a place on earth.&nbsp; The Angels, however, showed the Cubs how
  it is done offensively.&nbsp; They had multiple successful bunts, they stole bases,
  and they hit for power--all without Morales or Aybar in the lineup.&nbsp; Though
  the Cubs showed some life late in the game, most of their six runs came from long
  balls.&nbsp; The Cubs seem so one-dimensional on offense, and to be a contender,
  the Cubs will have to show an ability to win games in the way that the Angels won
  yesterday.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Though the two defensive miscues
  by Baker were maddening, the play that really drove me nuts was the bunt with Grabow
  on the mound.&nbsp; Since Ivy Envy writer Jeremy was at the same game, maybe he
  can answer this question--Why the heck didn't Grabow cover first base on that play?&nbsp;
  I figured it was maybe because he had a potential play on the ball?&nbsp; Now that
  the offense is showing some signs of life, the Cubs have to step up their defense
  and relief pitching, or we will be able to stick a fork in this season.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption

<p>Now, this is only my second attempt at scoring a game, so don't scrutinize it too closely.&nbsp; You can see where I quit in the eighth inning, during Grabow's ineptitude.</p>
