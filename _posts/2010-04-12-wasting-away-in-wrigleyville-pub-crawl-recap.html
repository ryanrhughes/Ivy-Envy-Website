<p>As lame as it is, I was tweeting this trip.&nbsp; I thought about live-blogging, but I had no idea how that might end up, so I decided to keep it to Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah, city traffic.  Sitting on the Kennedy Expressway, trying to get to the WAIW Pub Crawl.                   <a rel="bookmark" href="http://twitter.com/IvyEnvy/status/11942786471"> 10:46 AM Apr 10th</a> via <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.seesmic.com/">Seesmic</a> from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=41.86862,-87.64452" target="_blank">University Village / Little Italy, Chicago </a></blockquote><br />
My wife is a Southern California native and I lived out there for a spell.  I grew to not mind traffic, but after living in the Quad Cities, I have little tolerance for sitting bumper-to-bumper with drivers that I find irritating.  Speaking of irritating -</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I remember why I like living where there's no traffic....and few hipsters     11:32 AM Apr 10th  via Seesmic  from Lakeview, Chicago</blockquote><br />
Chicago (at least the North Side) is over-run by douchey hipsters.  I do have some pleasant memories of the 80's but you assholes ruin it for me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Arrived at Lucky's. Ordering food as everyone is leaving for The Yard. Received badass WAIW shirts.     11:44 AM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
We were joined for the day by our friends, Bob and Lindsay.&nbsp; Bob writes for <a href="http://www.zoiksonline.com/" target="_blank">Zoiks</a>, an entertainment blog.&nbsp; They too ditched their kid for the day to enjoy a nice bar tour around Wrigleyville on an amazingly beautiful early April day.</p>
<p>For some reason, I misread the itineraries leading up to the event.&nbsp; I thought the meet-up was to commence at Lee's Sandwiches, not Lucky's Sandwiches.&nbsp; I couldn't understand why these guys would start off a pub crawl at a Vietnamese sandwich shop.&nbsp; I was relieved when I saw that the location was actually Lucky's and Lee's is primarily isolated to California.&nbsp; Sorry, I just don't like rock hard baguettes.&nbsp; I did like this:</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/070.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2369" title="Lucky's" src="/uploads/2010/04/070-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p>Because we were sitting on the Kennedy Expressway for most of the pre-game Lucky's time, we knew we were in a quandry.&nbsp; It's pub crawl suicide to start on an empty stomach.&nbsp; But at the same time, we don't really know our way around the area and what fun is a pub crawl if you are stuck at the pre-game restaurant waiting for your food?&nbsp; We decided that we definitely need to wolf down some food.&nbsp; It would be a long day.</p>
<blockquote><p>Arrived at Lucky's. Ordering food as everyone is leaving for The Yard. Received badass WAIW shirts.     11:44 AM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
We walked in Lucky's and immediately spotted John and Steve from <a href="www.acubsblog.com" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a>.&nbsp; They were quick to make us feel welcome and introduce us to some folks.&nbsp; John introduced me to the other <a href="www.exileonclark.com" target="_blank">Exile on Clark</a> guys.&nbsp; I have been a Thunder Matt's Saloon fan for a long time, so it was cool to meet those guys.&nbsp; As expected, everyone headed to The Yard at about the time we were ordering our food.&nbsp; It was a pleasant surprise that Lucky's service was snappy.&nbsp; We were able to eat and pay the bill within the 1st inning and meet up with the group to start the pub crawl.&nbsp; Here's the route:<br />
<center><img class="aligncenter" title="Route" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3pCRov6WHas/S7-IuZBltPI/AAAAAAAADMk/ARcmNraKJoY/s1600/chicago.jpg" alt="" width="414" height="658" /></center></p>
<p><strong>1st Inning - The Yard</strong></p>
<p>We arrived at The Yard with one out in the bottom half of the inning.&nbsp; I had yet consumed a beer and decided to hold off until Merkle's because we wouldn't have much time at The Yard.&nbsp; Tawny and Lindsay ordered a few waters.&nbsp; The server brought us four glasses of water and a pitcher of ice water as we were walking out the door.&nbsp; What kind of a server brings non-paying customers ice water in a packed bar?&nbsp; A nice one, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Inning - Merkle's</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Merkle's is an Iowa Hawkeye's bar...about to lose my lunch.     12:28 PM Apr 10th  via<br />
Seesmic</blockquote><br />
I hate the Iowa Hawkeyes.  I spotted the Iowa flag flying outside and had to fight the initial urge to head on to the next bar.  Merkle's seemed like a decent bar.  Obviously, there was a little too much black and gold around for my liking, but the beer was cold and I was surrounded by a lot of Cubby blue to distract me.  A few photos were snapped.<br />

<p>The Cubs and the Reds were moving the game right along and a mere 8 minutes later:</p>
<blockquote><p>These innings are flying by...on to Mullen's.     12:36 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
<strong>3rd Inning - Mullen's</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A Michigan State bar. Good thing this one is early in the crawl...you know, because MSU sucks late in the season.     12:41 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
A poor attempt at a Twitter joke.  If you don't follow college football, Michigan State is known for starting strong and melting down halfway through the season.  It provides moments like these:</p>

<p>I miss John L. Smith.&nbsp; It's remarkable that he could not coach any discipline into that team.&nbsp; I'll always remember the Spartans knocking off Notre Dame in South Bend and deciding to "act like they've been there before" by planting a flag at the 50 yard line.</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" title="MSU" src="http://www.brendanloy.com/blog/images/msu-flag-nd.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="167" /></center></p>
<p>Apparently he did not coach them well enough for them to realize they were 15 yards off and planting it at the 35 yard line.&nbsp; The next year, Notre Dame benefited from an epic MSU meltdown in a rainstorm and Smith apparently thought everyone in college football is as classless as his program was and dispatched his players to "protect" midfield.</p>
<p><center><img class="aligncenter" title="MSU Protection" src="http://www.bluegraysky.com/2006games/msu/spartans_last_stand.jpg" alt="" width="324" height="400" /></center></p>
<p>Oh yeah....baseball...pub crawl.<br />
<center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/077.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2399" title="Tawny and Lindsay" src="/uploads/2010/04/077-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="434" height="325" /></a></center></p>
<p><strong>4th Inning - Sluggers</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently, all these bars have Big 10 allegiances. Sluggers is an Indiana bar, but they have batting cages. Oh, there's a baseball game     12:57 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
I don't hate Indiana enough to comment.  All of these bars were pretty empty, so the 80 or so pub crawlers were able to walk in and pretty much own the place.  After ordering some Old Style, we headed upstairs to the batting cages to watch Steve and John from WAIW take some Batting Practice.  Their display of batting prowess fit right in with what I've seen from Chad Tracy this year.</p>

<p>You have probably noticed there is no commentary on the Cubs vs. Reds baseball game.&nbsp; I have no idea what happened in that game.&nbsp; All I know is that someone scored to lengthen the inning for us a little so we could enjoy Slugger's for a bit.&nbsp; I believe the Reds scored a few runs.</p>
<p><strong>5th Inning - Harry Caray's</strong></p>
<p>Harry Caray's is the only bar on the crawl that I had been to before.&nbsp; I didn't care for it then, it didn't do too much for me this time.&nbsp; Tawny hadn't seen the bust of Harry, so we did the little tourist photo op that I would despise if I was a native to Chicago.&nbsp; We weren't the only ones with flashing cameras, so we didn't feel so silly.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/091.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2431" title="Tawny and Harry" src="/uploads/2010/04/091-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="300" /></a></center></p>

<p>We did not have one drink at Harry Caray's.&nbsp; Why, might you ask?</p>
<blockquote><p>Left Harry's early...$5 pitchers at Captain Morgan's Club. Beautiful day...oh yeah, there's a ball game. Who's playing?     1:35 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
<strong>6th Inning - Captain Morgan's Club</strong></p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/IMG00136.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2434" title="Captain Morgan's " src="/uploads/2010/04/IMG00136-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" /></a></center></p>
<p>I was pretty skeptical of this place.&nbsp; I assume this thing was built for yuppies and the new breed of Cubs fans, and I'm probably right.&nbsp; The marble sinks in the restrooms didn't do much to dispel this opinion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hit the bathroom at Capt Morgan's. Hit my head on the drink holder. Feels weird to piss where the general public was standing not long ago     1:46 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
I was shocked that anything attached to Wrigley would have $5 pitchers, but sure shit enough, they did.  I don't know if it is the usual special or if WAIW conned them into it, but I was happy.  Happy until we went for our second pitcher and found out the deal was over because they ran out of pitchers.  No problem, we'll just get the empty pitcher from our table and they can refill it.  Nope, a server had picked it up.  Time to move on.<br />
<strong>7th Inning - The Dugout</strong></p>
<p>We walked over to the Dugout with John and the rest of the first wave of crawlers.&nbsp; The Dugout's doors are locked....closed.&nbsp; Ok, so you are within a stone's throw of Wrigley Field.&nbsp; Baseball season is underway, the weather is beautiful, there's quite a few people milling around Wrigleyville and you're closed?!&nbsp; The name of your bar is The Dugout!&nbsp; People might assume that there is some sort of connection between the name and location of your bar.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dugout, Stop 7 is closed. Tawny suggests altering the pub crawl shirts.     1:57 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
We head back over to Captain Morgan's and stand outside in the sunshine and discuss weight loss obsession.</p>
<p><strong>8th Inning - Murphy's</strong></p>
<p>I liked the place a lot.  Memorabilia on the wall, plenty of room without feeling huge, outdoor seating...a cool place.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/101.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2441" title="101" src="/uploads/2010/04/101-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="301" /></a></center></p>
<blockquote><p>Guy next to me (non Crawl person) informs me that Soriano is a streaky hitter. I had no idea.     2:25 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>Did not move to bar #9 for inning #9. Murphy's is the place. I declare an Ivy Envy trip to Wrigleyville during a #Cubs game this year.     2:34 PM Apr 10th  via Seesmic</blockquote><br />
Marmol looks absolutely filthy and gets the save.&nbsp; The Cubs win and people cheer in celebration. &nbsp; I'm relieved nobody in the bar starts singing "Go Cubs Go".&nbsp; This makes me like Murphy's even more.</p>
<p><center>[caption id="attachment_2443" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="View from outdoor seating area of Murphy&#39;s"]<a href="/uploads/2010/04/098.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2443" title="View from Murphy's" src="/uploads/2010/04/098-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="299" /></a>[/caption]</center></p>
<p>From Murphy's, we headed to the Cubs clothing shops to fulfill Goal #3, to buy a Cubs jersey.&nbsp; Well, I went 2 for 3 on the day with those initial goals.&nbsp; Wrigleyville Sports was closed for construction or something.&nbsp; Sports World sucked and only had authentic jerseys.&nbsp; I can't pay for daycare for two kids AND buy a $179 jersey, sorry.&nbsp; Looks like I'll be buying the replica online.</p>
<p><strong>9th Inning - Bernie's</strong></p>
<p>We arrive about 45 minutes after the 9th inning ends, but we do make it to bar #10 (including Lucky's).&nbsp; 10 bars in 9 innings.&nbsp; That is epic, my friends.&nbsp; I don't remember much of Bernie's.&nbsp; I had a lengthy discussion with Jake (those guys have too many AKA's) of Thunder Matt's Saloon and Exile on Clark.&nbsp; I'm not sure if either of us knew what we were talking about.&nbsp; Any discussion that starts at a urinal is likely to be difficult to remember later.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure we decided that he will be a guest on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ivy-envy/id306933992" target="_blank">Ivy Envy Podcast</a> sometime in the near future.&nbsp; What I do remember about Bernie's is that we apparently crossed paths with a pub crawl for douchey guys dressed like golfers.&nbsp; I can only assume it was for The Masters.&nbsp; A girl with them was barely clothed and it really seemed to irritate a girl that was with the WAIW group.&nbsp; She was passionate about it and ended up asking me if I would have sex with Brad Pitt if he was clearly not intelligent.&nbsp; I don't recall how I answered this hypothetical.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Innings - The Gingerman</strong></p>
<p>The 11th bar of the day.&nbsp; We walked past The Metro and reminisced the late 90's.&nbsp; This is the bar where we started to come off our buzz.&nbsp; We had a long drive ahead of us back to the Quad Cities.&nbsp; Met a fellow Quad Citian as I bid farewell.&nbsp; It was nice to meet Mark from Bettendorf and hopefully we'll see him down at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline on April 26th for Ivy Envy's first event of the year.</p>
<p>The day ended for us with a stop at Ikea, which is not a fun store to be in when you start developing that drunk headache.&nbsp; Dinner at Red Robin sobered me up and we got home at midnight.&nbsp; I hope there was a healthy number of the crawlers still going at it at a bar near Wrigley.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an incredible day.&nbsp; If there is a 3rd Annual WAIW Pub Crawl, I will be there.&nbsp; I believe there will be a large number of Quad Cities folks there, too.&nbsp; The idea of renting a bus for the trip next year has even been discussed.&nbsp; John and Steve did an amazing job.&nbsp; The thing was organized and went off without a hitch.</p>
<p>I'm glad Bob and Lindsay were able to make the trip, too.&nbsp; I would have been even more awkward if there wasn't a few other people I knew.&nbsp; It was great to meet everyone.&nbsp; I would say that I enjoyed watching the Cubs with a bunch of like-minded people, but I'm not sure anyone was really paying attention to the game.</p>
<p>I'm ready to do it again.&nbsp; If you didn't go this year, you've been notified that you really should not miss this event next year.</p>
