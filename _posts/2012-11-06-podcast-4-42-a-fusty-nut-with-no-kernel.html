<p>It's election night, and Andy, Corey and Kurt put the tv pundits on mute while we take a while to talk about the Cubs.  The Cubs have been speaking with Ryan Dempster about returning to the Cubs.  How would you feel about Dempster coming back?  The Cubs were reportedly close to dealing Carlos Marmol for Dan Haren.  We discuss this trade, and the impact that Twitter and social networks in general are having on situations like this.  </p>
<p>We check in with the players from the Cubs organization that are participating in the Arizona Fall League.  Then Kurt gives us the <u>Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flex of the Week</u>.  </p>

<p>To wrap things up, we choose a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
