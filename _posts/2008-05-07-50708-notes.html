<p>Jon Lieber gets his first start of the year and he promptly gives up 4 HR's in one inning.&nbsp; As I am typing this, he is not yet out of the second inning, so that total could change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I really have to agree with what Cubfan1452 said&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-64"></a>about the Cubs only going as far as their pitching will take them.&nbsp; That is becoming more evident with every game.&nbsp; The Cubs desperately need to strengthen the four and five slots.&nbsp; I'm not completely comfortable with Ted Lilly, either.&nbsp; It's so disheartening to see the bullpen warming up in the second inning.&nbsp; I think if the Cubs want to make a legitimate post-season run, they need to acquire some better pitching.&nbsp; This bullpen is going to be on empty by the end of the year if this keeps up.&nbsp; Well, Lou pulled Lieber.&nbsp; He lasted 2.0 innings.&nbsp; Great.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; As most of the writers here know, I have pretty strong opinions on players.&nbsp; These&nbsp;opinions are typically not rooted in reality.&nbsp; For some reason, I've never really liked Ronny Cedeno.&nbsp; But little Ronny is hitting .373 with an OBP of .458 and 18 RBI in 23 games.&nbsp; He was definitely the bright spot of yesterday's game.&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the Cubs on the board with a two run single in the fourth inning.&nbsp;&nbsp;I definitely like what I've seen out of Cedeno this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* The&nbsp;Zambrano-Cedeno pick-off of Joey Votto at second was awesome.&nbsp; It was the bottom of the second inning and Zambrano had two on and one out.&nbsp; I sensed that impending doom feeling that I sometimes get with Zambrano on the hill.&nbsp; He didn't make a great throw to 2nd base, but Cedeno went and got the ball, then laid his knee down to block the bag with his leg.&nbsp; As Len or Bob said on today's pre-game show, that shows great advanced scouting.&nbsp; Cedeno knew that Votto would go in head first rather than feet first, so he knew he could lay his leg down and not worry about getting cleated.&nbsp; That is the depth and fundamentally sound baseball that we did not see under Dusty Baker.&nbsp; In fact, I saw a replay with the Reds broadcasters and they were talking about what an error in fundamentals it was for Votto.&nbsp; Hey, you guys wanted Dusty...now you have him.&nbsp;</p>
