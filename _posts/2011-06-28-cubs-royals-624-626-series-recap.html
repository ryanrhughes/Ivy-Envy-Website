<p><strong>The Cubs ended the series 31-46.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Royals ended the series 33-45.</strong></p>

<p>I had this series circled on my mental calendar as the series that the Cubs could finally sweep.&nbsp; They were still looking for that elusive three-game winning streak, and this would finally be it.&nbsp; If there is a team as miserable as the Cubs this year outside of the Astros, the Royals are it.&nbsp; The Cubs' 74-game quest for three in a row was becoming epic like Cortez' search for gold or Peewee's journey to the Alamo.&nbsp; Like Peewee's bike, the Cubs' World Series Championship has to be in the basement of the Alamo.</p>
<p>The Cubs won the first game of the series,&nbsp;and it definitely felt like luck was on their side for once.&nbsp; They benefitted from a questionable call.&nbsp; With the game tied in the ninth, Tony Campana tried to put down a bunt that appeared to be caught on the fly by the Royals' third baseman, Mike Moustakas.&nbsp; The ump ruled that it was not a catch, and this call paved the way for the Cubs to win the game.&nbsp; Despite pretty good pitching from Dempster and the bullpen, it didn't seem like the Cubs really deserved the win after being thrown out on the basepaths four times in the game.&nbsp; It felt like Theriot was back in blue.&nbsp; Quade defended the outs by saying that he would rather see the Cubs be aggressive and fail than lazy and fail.&nbsp; I guess that works for me.</p>

<p>In this game, the Cubs appeared to salvage Carlos Zambrano's&nbsp;quality start when Ramirez and Soto hit back-to-back solo shots in the sixth inning to tie the score at two.&nbsp; I was watching this game, and it really felt like the Cubs would ride the momentum created by these homers to victory.&nbsp; But Samardzija was there to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.&nbsp; I'm not as much of a Samardzija apologist as Corey, but he definitely has the "stuff" to be a great pitcher.&nbsp; The problem is that I've never really seen him control it that well, and at this point, will he ever be able to?</p>
<p>With this loss, the&nbsp;Cubs once again hit the reset button on their quest.</p>

<p>This game got off to a terrible start with Wells giving up four runs in the first inning.&nbsp; The Cubs gave me hope when they made it 4-3 in the fourth inning, but the Royals then got two back in the bottom half of the inning.&nbsp; Soto hit a homer in this game too, and he seems to be getting on track offensively.&nbsp; I'm a big Soto fan, but his offensive woes this year have really hurt the team.&nbsp; With Pena, Ramirez, and Soto now swinging pretty hot bats, the Cubs seem poised to go on a run, but unfortunately, they've pretty much dug a hole to China in the NL Central.&nbsp; The games in the upcoming weeks should at least be entertaining to watch.</p>
