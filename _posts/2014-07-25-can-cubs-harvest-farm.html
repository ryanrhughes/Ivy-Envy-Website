  content: I had always assumed the Cardinals were consistently ranking with the best
    farm systems.  They are nowhere in the top 5 for any of these years.   Don't they
    always brag about their amazing home grown players? But, yes, this is very promising
    for the Cubbies!

  content: "I'd like to see what the teams did with their top talent. Did they actually
    hold onto them to achieve this success? Or did they trade potential for talent?
    \nI'm also trying to find an explanation for the Cardinals. Perhaps it's their
    ability to draft quality guys deep. Their 40 man is regularly made up of between
    60 percent and 70 percent original draft picks. You don't get to percentages that
    high with high-profile picks alone. They, too, have had their share of first-round
    fizzles over the last 10 years: Tyler Herron, Brett Wallace, Mark McCormick just
    to name a few from a few years ago."

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08-300x240.jpg" alt="cubs logo" width="300" height="240" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9462" /></a>A lot has been made recently of the Chicago Cubs minor league system and the rise in rankings since Theo Epstein and company have started their version of the annual Cubs rebuilding process. </p>
<p>There seems to be some optimism building in Wrigleyville over this future influx of talent despite the big league club continuing to do its part to help management stockpile high draft picks. Of course, &ldquo;There's always next year&rdquo; is a common refrain in Cubdom, and for every optimist, there is a fan who cannot let themselves believe in these farm system saviors. Only the future will answer this question definitively, but I thought I would see if there were clues to be found in the past.</p>
<p>I decided to look back about 10 years to see how the top farm systems impacted their big league clubs over the following years. I used the <a href="http://baseballamerica.com" target="_blank">Baseball America</a> rankings for this article simply because all of their past rankings were easily available online. I will not be looking at whether individual players made it to the majors with their club because a good farm system can still affect the fortunes of the parent team through trades as well as bringing up home-grown talent. </p>
<p>For this article, I used the top five farm systems from 2004 to 2010 and compared that to the divisional and World Series champions from 2007 to 2013. The three year difference is there to allow time for the minor league to feed the major league club. Those teams, rankings, and champs are listed below this article. </p>
<p>After looking at the numbers, I'm happy to announce that Cubs fans can start to get excited. The correlation between having an organizational ranking in Baseball America's top five and winning a division or making a World Series appearance is very good. Out of 35 teams ranked in the top five over the seven year period, over 50 percent of the divisional champs were in this group. </p>
<p>The same is true for World Series appearances with seven of the 14 teams over the seven year period being in the top five lists prior to making the World Series. Of those seven teams, four became World Series champions. That is a pretty high percentage especially when you consider that some top five organizations were facing other organizations from the top five list in the playoffs or the World Series. Only four teams who made the top five list did not win a division championship in the following years, but one of those teams, the Rockies, did eventually make an appearance in the World Series via the Wild Card. </p>
<p>For everyone who wants to make the argument that these players will not have an impact any time soon, there are two instances in which the farm system made a definite impact on the big league team in the same year that the team made the World Series. In 2007 the Colorado Rockies had to rely heavily on rookies called up mid-season to go on a historic 21-1 run at the end of the season to make the Wild Card spot. </p>
<p>As a Wild Card team, they made it to the World Series only to lose to the Red Sox. In 2008, the Tampa Bay Rays also called on their farm system when they brought Evan Longoria up as a replacement for an injured Willy Aybar. The Rays eventually lost to the Phillies. </p>
<p>All of this is truly marginal analysis of a small sample size and there are a thousand different things that teams need to do in order to start winning divisions and making World Series appearances, but at least it does put the Cubs in good company. Another plus is that most of the teams that made the top five list won multiple division titles, which shows a positive correlation to extended success. Although the Cubs will need more than just a good farm system to become eventual champions, it does look like there is reason to have joy in Wrigleyville. Good things do seem to be coming our way.</p>

<p>NOTE: Red Sox did win the World Series in 2007, but I did not list it simply because their farm system rankings fell outside of the data set that I was using. Also, the Indians won a division in 2007, but that was before 2010 in which they were ranked in the top five according to this data set. These teams, as well as other teams that had success may have had top five farm systems in years earlier than 2004 when I started the data set for this article. </p>
