<p>Since we are just one series past the All-Star break, we look back at the Cubs team and individual performances on this, the 262<sup>nd</sup> episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  </p>
<p>We look at the positives and negatives that we've seen from April to July.  If you feel that we spend too much time on the prospects in the minor leagues, this is a very major league team centered episode.  </p>
<p>There are some very encouraging performances and some downright horrible performances...bad enough to provide us quite a few scary stats throughout the episode and two in the regular segment.  </p>
<p>We answer several listener submitted questions and read three internet muscle flexes.  </p>
