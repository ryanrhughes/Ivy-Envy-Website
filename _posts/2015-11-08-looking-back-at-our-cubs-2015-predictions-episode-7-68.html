Most of the stats we predicted seemed logical in April, but this 2015 season didn't exactly go the way we thought it would.</p>
<p>Join us as we look back at all of the stats we predicted.  We also answer a couple of listener questions.  </p>
<p>Michael from Galesburg joins us on this episode. Check out his podcast, <a href="http://theawesome80s.net" target="_blank">The Awesome 80's Podcast</a>.</p>
