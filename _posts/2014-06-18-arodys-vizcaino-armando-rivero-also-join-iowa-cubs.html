<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs-300x272.png" alt="Iowa Cubs Logo" width="300" height="272" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9092" /></a>It turns out that Kris Bryant isn't the only player from the Tennessee Smokies who has been promoted to the Iowa Cubs. &nbsp;Pitchers Arodys Vizcaino and Armando Rivero will also be joining Bryant at the triple-A level. &nbsp;If you're a Cubs fan, and you live anywhere near Des Moines, it is time to make your way to Principal Park. &nbsp;Six of the Cubs' top 20 prospects (MLB.com rankings)&nbsp;are&nbsp;now on the I-Cubs roster.</p>
<p>The Cubs have been waiting for quite some time to see a return on the Paul Maholm trade of 2012. &nbsp;Maholm and Reed Johnson were sent to the Braves along with some cash in exchange for pitchers Jaye Chapman and Arodys Vizcaino. &nbsp;Both Chapman and Vizcaino have dealt with a spate of injuries in the past couple of years. &nbsp;Chapman, who had double hip surgery in 2013, is no longer with the organization, and the main piece in the trade for the Cubs, Vizcaino, has been slowly working his way back from Tommy John surgery. &nbsp;The good news is that he&nbsp;appears to be back. &nbsp;Vizcaino has&nbsp;had a great run in his time with both Daytona and Tennessee&nbsp;this season--he's faced 86 batters and has&nbsp;26 strikeouts, 7 walks, and a 1.99 ERA. &nbsp;Due to his injury history, he is likely to be a reliever with the big-league club, and it seems reasonable to expect&nbsp;to see him in Chicago at some point in 2014.</p>
<p>Armando Rivero is a Cuban pitcher who signed with the Cubs in 2013 and received a 3.1 million bonus. &nbsp;He has also been pitching well with Tennessee this season. &nbsp;In 34.2 IP, Rivero has a 1.56 ERA, 10 saves, 54K, and 16 BB. &nbsp;According to <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2013/03/cubs-sign-armando-rivero.html" target="_blank">this post on MLB Trade Rumors</a>, none of his secondary pitches come close to his great fastball, but his secondary stuff must have developed since his signing for him to achieve such a great K/BB ratio this season.</p>
