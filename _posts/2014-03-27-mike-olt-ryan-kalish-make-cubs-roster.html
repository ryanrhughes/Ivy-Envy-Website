    Arizona early in the off season. Glad all the work payed off

  content: Me neither until last night. I keep forgetting he will be eligible for
    it. I think he won't be the favorite but he could be a guy sneaking in the weeds
    for it! Just a thought!

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+Ceo87HdN43il.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9348" alt="Mike Olt" src="/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+Ceo87HdN43il-209x300.jpg" width="209" height="300" /></a>When Donnie Murphy was acquired off waivers by the Rangers yesterday, it appeared as though Mike Olt will most likely be the starting 3<sup>rd</sup> baseman for the Cubs as they start the 2014 season on Monday in Pittsburgh. While I guess we don't technically know if Mike Olt will be starting on Monday, we do know that he is on the Cubs 25-man roster, as is Ryan Kalish.<br />
<em>*EDIT 12:46pm -  Carrie Muskat tweeted if Liriano starts for the Pirates on Monday, Olt will start at 3<sup>rd</sup> base.</em></p>
<p>Olt's eye issues seem to be behind him and his sore shoulder is feeling well enough for him to start 2014 with the big league team. Olt is batting .275/.321/.608 with 5 HR and 12 RBIs in 56 plate appearances. If Olt can continue to perform at the plate, he offers a nice upgrade over the Valbuena/Murphy tandem we expected. An August infield of Olt, Castro, Baez, Rizzo sounds pretty damn nice.</p>
<p>Ryan Kalish is hitting .275/.370/.300 in Spring Training and worked his way into the outfield picture. I haven't seen a ton of Kalish, but he's got some speed and seems to work counts well.</p>
<p>We also learned today that the Cubs have not yet decided on who will occupy the 5th starter spot:<br />

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Cubs&amp;src=hash">#Cubs</a> final pitching decisions to be made over weekend. Does not appear they will skip 5th starter's spot in early going of season</p>

<p>I still think Carlos Villanueva should get the spot, but I could see Chris Rusin filling in.  </p>
<p>Mike Olt is still a young player and with only 16 games of MLB experience, we can expect some struggles against MLB pitching.  But if things go well for Olt, he could be one of the earliest successes (especially at the MLB level) this front office can hang it's hat on.  </p>
