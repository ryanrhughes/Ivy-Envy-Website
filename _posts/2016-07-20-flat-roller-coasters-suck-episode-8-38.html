  content: "Everything you said about Aroldis Chapman in this podcast is every reason
    I do not want the Cubs to pursue that guy, and I appreciate your putting your
    feelings on the line when a lot of the jersey-buying/internet-flexing crowd
    don't really care. \nI do not want that guy pumping his fist after closing out
    the World Series on the cover of SI. \nI want our front office to build a team
    that doesn't need that kind of a sociopath to win a title. I remember Limited
    Range saying this and I remember Julie DiCaro talking about this...it matters
    to me, and it matters when you consider that the pleasure of winning should match
    the means that it took. \nIsn't that Joe's ethos? \nThe pleasure matching the
    pressure? \nI'd rather wait until 2017 than see Aroldis Chapman in a Cubs uniform.
    \nI'd honestly rather savor last season and see some progress this than sell our
    souls out to obtain that guy.\nSmart (brilliant, cruel) trades with the A's and
    the Rangers, good draft picks, the best scouts, a good team mentality, smart bullpen
    management, the right kind of potato chips...I'd rather wait until 2017 than see
    Aroldis Chapman in a Cubs uniform on the cover of Sports Illustrated."

On this episode, we talk about the Cubs series win over the New York Mets.  The Cubs won the series 2 games to 1, but because Andy and Corey were at Tuesday night's loss, we spend some time talking about the Cubs difficulties with hitting with runners in scoring position.  We also look at the Hector Rondon and discuss whether or not he is "the guy".  </p>
<p>It's not all negatives though, Jake Arrieta looked like the Jake we all know and love.  Oh yeah, and the Cubs traded for a pitcher and sent Dan Vogelbach to the Mariners.  We talk about this trade and how it could impact the Cubs now and in the future.  </p>
