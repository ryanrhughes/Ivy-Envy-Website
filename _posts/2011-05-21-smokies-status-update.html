<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tennessee-Smokies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5299" title="Tennessee Smokies" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Tennessee-Smokies.jpg" alt="" width="266" height="190" /></a></p><br />
The Smokies have been playing well as a team.&nbsp; They are 7-3 in their last ten games and own the best record in the Southern League.&nbsp; I wish Kodak was closer, so we could see this exciting team play.</p>
<p>Because of the issues with the big league roster, the Smokies have had their share of players joining and leaving the&nbsp;team throughout the season.&nbsp; Most recently, one of the Cubs' top pitching prospects, Chris Carpenter was moved from Iowa back to the Smokies.&nbsp; This season, Carpenter struggled a little in the bullpen for Iowa (6.41 ERA), but&nbsp;he pitched fairly well in a starting role for Tennessee for most of last season.&nbsp; The Iowa Cubs get relief pitcher Blake Parker in exchange.</p>
<p>Injuries are also a pressing concern for the Smokies right now.&nbsp; They are stretched thin in the outfield with Brett Jackson, Jim Adduci and Ty Wright all on the disabled list.&nbsp; Jackson has ligament damage in his left pinky finger.&nbsp; Hopefully these guys can make it back soon.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Smokies are pretty dominant.&nbsp; Most of the starters are hitting .300-plus.&nbsp; The one concern is Josh Vitters, who is currently hitting just .257 with a .296 OBP.&nbsp; Tennessee's pitching is getting the job done for the most part.&nbsp; They have a 4.10 team ERA which ranks fifth in the Southern League.</p>
