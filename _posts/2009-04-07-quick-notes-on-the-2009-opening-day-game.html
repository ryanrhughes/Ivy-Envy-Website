<p>I wasn't able to see the majority of last night's game.&nbsp; First off, my dog got loose and I spent the first 30 minutes trying to lure her home.&nbsp; Then I went to the airport to pick up the in-laws.&nbsp; From there we went out to eat, so I was able to see a little at the restaurant.&nbsp; I DVR'd the game, but haven't had a chance to watch it.&nbsp; Here are a few notes from what I saw:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Soriano's season-starting HR was great.&nbsp; It also leads to more interesting "lead off" discussion.&nbsp; Is it better to have a guy up there that can give you a quick 1-0 start and put the other team on their heels or to have a guy with speed and a high OBP?&nbsp; We know what Lou has decided and it gives buffoons like us fodder for months.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; It was really nice to see Zambrano come out and pitch a strong game.&nbsp; The guy is a beast and I love that he wears Cubbie Blue.&nbsp; It was cool to see the Cubs take care of Oswalt.&nbsp; He's a great pitcher that has dominated everyone, but somehow the Cubs have managed to do well against him.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I couldn't help but laugh when I saw Milton Bradley turn his ankle on first base.&nbsp; It just seemed like the way the Cubs WOULD start a season.&nbsp; Big money to a big name....good/great Spring Training...injured in the first game.&nbsp; I was relieved to see him return to the field in the bottom half of the inning.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Tonight - Dempster vs. Rodriguez.&nbsp; I'll take that matchup.</p>
