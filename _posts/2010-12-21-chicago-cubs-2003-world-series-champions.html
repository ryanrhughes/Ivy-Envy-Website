  content: "This link will probably answer your question. It's an ended Ebay auction
    of a T-shirt from when the Cubs won the World Series in 2005 with a losing record
    and without even making the playoffs. Pretty impressive feat, I'd say. Probably
    a record.\r\n\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.com/Chicago-Cubs-2005-World-Series-Champions-Shirt-NWT-/150208291619?pt=US_Baseball_Fan_Shop&amp;hash=item22f91ca323#ht_798wt_754"

  content: Let me retract... I appears that is an asking price for a buy-it-now auction.
    May want to rethink.

  content: "Corey,\r\n\r\nThe last article explains everything.  I used to work for
    Goodwill, and what happens is the team that loses and prints that merch takes
    it to a local Goodwill dispensary where it is supposed to go directly to Africa.
    \ \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, every once in a while it doesn't make it because somebody
    that works there snags it as a souvenir.  The league and the companies that are
    in charge of the lisencing sdon't do anything about it, because no one in their
    right mind would sue a charity, so it happens every once in a while.\r\n\r\nExcellent
    find nonetheless.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Let me start by admitting that I am a thrift store shopper.  I love digging through the junk other people cast off, in hopes of finding some golden nugget.  I'm mainly a t-shirt shopper.  Anyone that has spent a good amount of time in Salvation Army stores or Goodwill shops knows that you will find some incredible clothes that makes Strange Cargo look lame (it is), and at a fraction of the price.</p>
<p>My love for thrift shops might be due to my tendency to attempt to save a nickel.  But I really like the style of thrift shop clothes.  Where else could I find a shirt that says "Linguists don't die - they get obligatorily deleted"?  I like the oddness and uniqueness of the shirts, records and beer mugs that can be found at these shops.</p>
<p>After the 2008 season, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=270" target="_blank">I wrote a post</a> in which I talked about going to a Salvation Army and finding a plethora of Cubs t-shirts.  I suspected that some life-long Cubs fan had finally suffered enough heartache and cut off their ties with the Cubs and donated their Cubs threads to the Salvation Army.  Being a frugal guy, I jumped all over the multiple Zambrano and Ramirez t-shirts.  But for the most part, Cubs shirts are hard to come by at thrift shops.  Most that I find are from the mid 90's with absolutely lame graphics and two sizes too big.</p>
<p>Well, I'm here in rain-drenched Southern California for the holidays.  I made an early morning "My body is still on Central time" trip to Albertson's yesterday morning.  When I pulled into the parking lot, my thrift shop radar went on high alert and I noticed a new HUGE Salvation Army in the shopping center.  The racks and racks of t-shirts was a glimpse of heaven.  This is the biggest Salvation Army I have been in since the one that I went to in Atlanta about 10 years ago.  That one had rows of cars and boats for sale.</p>
<p>As I started perusing these racks, I expected to see some Dodgers and Angels shirts.  There were very few Dodgers shirts in this Orange County shop in the center of Angels country and there was a few Angels shirts (my AL team), but they were all too big.  Apparently some Angels fan that wears XL shirts decided to pull the plug on his team after they missed the playoffs for the 3rd time in the 9 years since their World Series Championship.&nbsp; I saw quite a few USC shirts.  NCAA sanctions didn't scare off the So-Cal fairweather fans, but a 7-5 season and a loss to Notre Dame did.</p>
<p>Obviously, I didn't expect to see many Midwest sports shirts, but I did find one Bears shirt.  I hit the blue shirt section, which normally gets me a little antsy to find a great Cubs shirt.  But I'm 2000 miles from Wrigley Field and I know this is likely not to happen.  As I flip through the shirts, I see a Cubs logo.  I don't look too closely, and it looks like the design of a 2007 or 2008 NL Central Division Champions shirt.  I pull it off the rack and I'm sure those standing around me wonder why I'm standing with my jaw dropped, staring at this Cubs t-shirt.  This is what I see:</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Media-CardBlackBerrypicturesIMG00541.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3522" title="Media CardBlackBerrypicturesIMG00541" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Media-CardBlackBerrypicturesIMG00541-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="272" /></a> </center></p>
<p>That's right.  I found a shirt that should have never existed, let alone be released into the public.  As I stood, staring at this shirt, all the memories of 2003 washed over me.  The excitement...the hope...the absolute pain.  I don't see how any Cubs fan can think about that season without feeling as if they're about to lose control of their emotions.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I snagged this shirt.  I don't know what to do with it.  Is it a collectors item?  Should it be blown up like the Bartman ball?  If it was the right size, would I wear it?  Should I let my crafty female friends carve into it and do something creative with it?  Give me some suggestions.  Is this a "piece" to chuckle at or should it be obliterated?</p>
<p><a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Rangers-World-Series-title-gear-will-be-shipped-?urn=mlb-282847" target="_blank">Here is an article</a> on what is supposed to happen with these shirts.  They are usually sent to impoverished areas of the world.  I like one of the comments - "Somewhere in Africa, there is a village that thinks the Buffalo Bills were the greatest team in NFL history."</p>
