<p>I'm still wondering if the neck and neck battle in the NL Central is a good or bad thing for me as a Cubs fan.&nbsp;Pessimism&nbsp;tells me it's bad and it would be great to see a ten game lead for the Cubs to lower my stress level. I like seeing competitive baseball so I'm leaning towards it being a good thing. A 162 game season will ensure that it won't last.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a pretty easy argument to make that the NL Central is the best in baseball to this point. There are only three teams in all of baseball (Toronto .622, Boston .600 and LA Dodgers.667) with a better winning percentage than the 3rd (or is it fourth) place tied Cubs and Reds (.588 winning percentage). The top four teams are nearly deadlocked at the top. St. Louis being the only team that seems to be playing worse lately.</p>
<p>It's always bothered me that before a single player sets foot on the field the NL Central is statistically the most difficult division with six teams battling for one division title while the meager AL West competes with just four and all others with five. The argument could be extended to the AL vs. NL. The AL fields just fourteen teams competing for 4 playoff spots while the NL competes for the same number of playoff spots with 16 teams. I'm horrible with numbers, but my calculator shows that if all things baseball were equal you have a 28.6% shot of making the playoffs in the AL and only a 25% shot in the NL. In the AL West you have a 25% chance to win the division and only a 16.7% chance in the NL Central. This is baseball. Hitting below .200 is so awful we have a name for it, .250 is average and .300 is pretty damn good. We live on stats and I've never heard anyone raise this argument. If you really want to make things complicated you can throw in the number of times a division leader will play the worst team in their division. The Cubs play the Pirates 15 times this year; the Rangers (currently leading the AL West) play the last placed A's 20 times. I won't dig any deeper.</p>
<p>There are few certainties in baseball, but here's a few things I think we can count on. Not all four of the top Central teams will be in contention at the end of the season. Houston will make a run toward the top at some point. St. Louis isn't going away. The Brewers seem to be getting better not worse so I don't think they're going anywhere either. It's going to be a long, tough season for Cubs, but if they continue to play well in times of adversity and develop the kind of depth that they have, then they have a shot at being on top of a great division in October. Even if they are at a statistical disadvantage.</p>
