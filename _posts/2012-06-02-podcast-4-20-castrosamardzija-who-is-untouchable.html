<p>Andy, Bob from Moline and Corey are joined by Kurt via Skype on this episode.  The Cubs end a 12-game skid and sweep the Padres.  Find out if this is enough to pull us back in.  </p>
<p>We talk a little about the 2012 MLB First Year Player Draft, which will begin on Monday.  We talk about the organizational needs in regards to position and what this first draft of the Epstein era means.  </p>
<p>It came out this week that the Cubs are willing to listen to offers from other teams on every player on the roster except Jeff Samardzija.  We discuss the idea of the Cubs trading Castro and why the Cubs might not entertain offers on Samardzija.  We make our predictions and discuss potential trades involving Dempster, Garza, LaHair, Johnson and Baker.  </p>
<p>Kurt provides us with a pretty incredible Scary Stat of the Week and we choose a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
