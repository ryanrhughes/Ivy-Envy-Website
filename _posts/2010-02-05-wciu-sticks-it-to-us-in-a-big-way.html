    of course.  \r\nThey're really improved that town in the last 10-15 years."

  content: "That's ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIn all fairness, this area has WAY more Cub
    fans than areas that are just an hour from the city like LaSalle/Peru or Streator.
    \ It's not even close.  There's even hoards of Cub fans in Iowa because their
    whole freaking state doesn't have a pro team.\r\n\r\nThere should be no reason
    we don't get this on television.  Obviously I'm sure there is some type of contract
    issue, but for crying out loud I'm sure SOMEBODY that works at that station could
    figure out a way to sell advertising during Opening Day for the Cubs.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Hey non-Chicago dwelling Cubs fans.&nbsp; How excited about the Cubs season opener are you?&nbsp; Well don't get too excited because the Cubs opening day game in Atlanta on April 5th is <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100204&amp;content_id=8019562&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">not going to be on TV for us</a>.&nbsp; Those of us that live in the Quad Cities will need to listen to Pat and Ron because the game will be broadcast on WCIU.</p>
<p>I have a hate-hate relationship with WCIU.&nbsp; We don't get WCIU here.&nbsp; I thought I had beaten the system last year by subscribing to MLB Extra Innings.&nbsp; However, even though we are almost 200 miles from Chicago, according to Major League Baseball, we are part of the Chicago-area market.&nbsp; So all I could do was watch the other teams feed in a small box with 7 other games on the screen.&nbsp; This gave me the other team's broadcasters to listen to because the delay with Pat and Ron was too distracting.</p>
<p>Another reason this opening day fiasco is devastating is that Opening Day is the day after Easter, which means I don't have to work and I would be able to watch the entire game live.&nbsp; I realize it is way too early to make your Opening Day plans (although it apparently isn't for me, so maybe it isn't for you either), but last year, I posted <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=759">how to watch games that aren't televised in your area</a>.&nbsp; Let's hope it works this year, though the thrill of Opening Day will be a little subdued if I'm huddled over a computer watching the game.</p>
