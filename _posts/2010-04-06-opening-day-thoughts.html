    they can do tonight.

<p>In retrospect, I should not have worried so much about this game being blacked out in our area.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to hear from folks if they had any trouble getting the game because of MLB/ESPN Blackout.&nbsp; I have DirecTV and it was offered as an alternate ESPN station.</p>
<p>I am trying to convince myself that I should not panic over this game.&nbsp; Throughout the game, I could hear myself uttering the same statement that I did for most of the season last year &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ok, they&rsquo;re just slumping.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll come around and perform like they&rsquo;re capable of.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, of course I understand how absurd it is to put so much into one game.&nbsp; But this thing was a train-wreck.&nbsp; So I am spending today convincing myself that it was just one bad start by Zambrano, one bad relief appearance by Jeff Samardzija <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2203" target="_blank">(hey now...careful)</a>, and a few pathetic plate appearances by everyone offensively, except Fukudome, Byrd and Ramirez.&nbsp; The off-day on the second day of the season is brutal on a fan whose team fared poorly on Opening Day.</p>
<p>I may lose my cool in a few days if the Pirates are still ahead of the Cubs in the standings, though.</p>
