<p>In a few short hours, Kurt and I will climb into a Toyota Corolla and drive 25 hours straight to sunny Mesa, Arizona - the Spring Training home of the Chicago Cubs.  We look forward to joining the retired snowbirds, as well as the other pale Midwesterners escaping the early Spring chills of Illinois by diving headfirst into heat and sunshine to watch the Cubs prepare for their 2011 campaign.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be able to make this trip and we'd like to bring as much of Spring Training to you as we can.  Over the next week, you can expect a barrage of information, commentary and tom-foolery from us.  The most immediate source of access to us would be through our Twitter account, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a>.  By the way, thank you to anyone that voted in the <a href="http://www.rcreader.com">River Cities Reader's</a> "Best of Spring 2011" poll.  Our Twitter account was voted #2 in the Quad Cities.</p>
<p>We will be tweeting live what we see and experience.  At the end of each day, we aim to post photos and podcasts to the website.  We hope to have some extras to bring you.  Some things have been lined up and some are in the works.  Check back here, follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and "like" us on F<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">acebook</a>.</p>
<p>We'd love to answer you questions.  If you'd like to know something about what's going on out there and you haven't been able to find an answer, e-mail me at corey@ivyenvy.com.  We'd love to take your questions on the podcast episodes.</p>
<p>Until we get to Arizona....Go Cubs!</p>
