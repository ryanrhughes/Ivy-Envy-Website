<p>Last week, I <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/2013-cubs-caravan-coming-to-peoria-on-january-16th" target="_blank">wrote a post</a> on the Cubs Caravan event in Peoria on Wednesday, January 16th.  More details are emerging on who will be representing the organization at this event.  </p>
<p>Cubs fans of all ages will have the opportunity to meet Mr Cub himself, Ernie Banks Wednesday evening at Exposition Garden.  Typically, even the organizers of the event in Peoria are unsure who will be representing the Cubs until the bus shows up in Peoria.  No players have been announced, but Keith Moreland (radio announcer) and James Rowson (hitting coach) will be appearing with Banks.  </p>
<p>According to my last post, tickets were going to be available at the door.  According to the <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/sports/x1926907689/Cubs-appearance-in-Peoria-includes-Ernie-Banks" target="_blank">Peoria Journal Star</a>, $10 tickets will now be available for purchase at the door.  The door tickets will include beer, soda, photographs, autographs and the program.  Those tickets will not include the meal that is provided with the pre-purchased tickets.  </p>
<p>The event is being held at Expo Gardens. Expo Gardens is located at 1601 West Northmoor Road in Peoria, IL. The doors open at 3:30, with the photograph and autograph session running from 4:45-5:30, followed by the program.  </p>
<p>If you are unable to attend this event, you can follow me on Twitter for updates - <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a> </p>
