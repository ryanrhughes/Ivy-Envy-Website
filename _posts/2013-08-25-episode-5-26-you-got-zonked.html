<p>Jeremy sits in for Kurt and joins Andy and Corey on this week's episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  The Matt Garza trade is complete and the Cubs received Neil Ramirez from the Rangers.  We look at Ramirez and guess what his future may be with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>The main portion of this episode is listener-submitted questions.  Should the Cubs sign either Jacoby Ellsbury or Shin-Soo Choo?  Can Vogelbach unseat Rizzo?  Will the Cubs trade Rizzo or Castro?  Does Castro need a mentor?  What has killed the Cubs more over the last few years, the bullpen or hitting with RISP?  We also pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
