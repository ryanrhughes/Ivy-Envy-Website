  content: i don't want them too... no reason not to keep castillo until schwarber
    or whatever young stud is the future of the cubs pitching duo... martin is old
    and will cost money and i don't see him being that much of a game changer

  content: Yes. Maybe I'm optimistic but he will be an invaluable  playoff presence.
    If we're gonna make it we want someone who has experience.

  content: I'd like to have him but his current contract wishes are a bit much. I've
    heard 5 years and somewhere around $85 million. I mean good on him trying to get
    a sweet payday but I can't stomach the thought of the Cubs paying him over $15
    million a year for that long.

On this, the 281<sup>st</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about a few of the main off-season rumors flying around about the Cubs.  The Cubs are being accused of tampering with Joe Maddon by the Rays.  Russell Martin is on the Cubs radar.  For some reason, the Cubs are involved in David Robertson rumors.  We talk about these things and talk about the impact of potential deals with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>Andy checks in on the Cubs prospects that are playing in the Arizona Fall League.  Kurt talks about the transactions the Cubs have made since the 2014 season ended.  </p>
<p>We answer a good group of listener questions and read a few internet muscle flexes...folks?!</p>
