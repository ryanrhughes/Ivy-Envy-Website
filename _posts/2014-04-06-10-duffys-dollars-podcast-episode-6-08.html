  content: to be fair, the Smokies hit a Blue Wahoo the inning before.  Mick Gillespie
    was chuckling about it.  Also, Bryant stole 2nd then scored, the ultimate retalliation

As you'd expect, there were some positives and negatives to discuss.  Emilio Bonafacio had no trouble getting on base, the issue was the rest of the team knocking him in.  We run through the minor league teams, discussing who is at the different levels and how they performed in their first week of the season.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener submitted questions, award some Asshats of the Week and pick a few winners in this week's caption contest.  </p>
<p>We talk a little about two events we have coming up.  On May 24th, we will be hosting a meet-up at the Iowa Cubs game.  We have solidified the plans yet, but keep an eye on the page for the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/iowa-cubs-game-meet/" target="_blank">event on our site </a>and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/620846641321103/" target="_blank">Facebook event page</a>.  Please RSVP and let us know if you're coming, or if you're considering it.  </p>
<p>Then, a week later, join us with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/225845124272878/" target="_blank">annual Wrigleyville Pub Crawl</a>, which is put on by John and Steve with <a href="http://acubsblog.com" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a>.  You can find all of the details at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wrigleyville" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/Wrigleyville</a>.  The Wrigley Field tour tickets will sell quickly, so don't wait too long to get those purchased.  </p>
