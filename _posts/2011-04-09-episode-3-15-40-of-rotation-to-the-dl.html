<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about Randy Wells and Andrew Cashner going to the DL and tendency of Cubs fans to throw around the names of Prior and Wood when injuries strike pitching.  We look at a few early season stats and discuss some players that are off to slow starts.  We also touch on the incident at Dodger Stadium because we will take any opportunity to bash Dodgers fans.  At the end of the show, we look at the photo caption contest and pick a winner.  </p>
