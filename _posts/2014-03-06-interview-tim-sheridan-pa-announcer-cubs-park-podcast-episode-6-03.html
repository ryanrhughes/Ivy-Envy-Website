During this miserable winter, many of us in the midwest wish that we were in Mesa, Arizona and attending Cubs Spring Training games at the brand new Cubs Park. We have spoken with Tim Sheridan many times on the podcast, including an in-person conversation when Kurt and I were at Hohokam Stadium a few years ago. You will probably recognize Tim's voice as he is the public address announcer for Cubs home Spring Training games.</p>
<p>Tim also runs <a href="http://boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>. You won't find better photos of the action in Mesa leading up to and during Spring Training than what Tim provides at Boys of Spring. You can connect with Tim Sheridan:</p>
