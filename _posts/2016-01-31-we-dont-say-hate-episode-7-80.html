<p>MLB Pipeline has released it's Top 100 MLB Prospect list and you'll find several Cubs prospects on that list.  We talk about the Cubs on the list and that leads us into a discussion about Spring Training non-roster invitees as two of those prospects were invited to Spring Training. We talk about all of the Spring Training dates and discuss the broadcast schedule.  </p>
<p>We check in on the Jake Arrieta contract issue as arbitration hearings are scheduled in February.  We share our opinions on how this will be resolved...or more accurately, how it won't be resolved.  </p>
<p>Speaking of contracts up-in-the-air, we check in on Dexter Fowler, who many believe may still end up with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>At the beginning, we mention our Ivy Envy Cubs @ Brewers Meet-up and Tailgate.  Tickets for this must be purchased by Friday, February 12<sup>th</sup>.  To purchase yours, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/tailgate">http://ivyenvy.com/tailgate</a></p>
