<p>We are a little over a month away from Episode #200 and we're inviting you to celebrate with us.  Details can be found at http://ivyenvy.com/200<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/200" target="_blank"></a>.  RSVP on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/138393423005544/" target="_blank">Facebook event</a> or email corey@ivyenvy.com if you are planning on coming or would like more information.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about the unexpected rise of Kevin Gregg.  In six appearances, Gregg has a 0.00 ERA and 4 saves.  I think you'll notice that we're not quite sure how to process this situation.  </p>
<p>We catch up on Ian Stewart and his progress in his rehab stint in Iowa.  He's batting .100 with 4 errors in 12 games.  The Cubs have added Cody Ransom at 3rd base and after a few games, he is playing well enough that he and Valbuena might be enough to keep Stewart away from the Cubs forever.  </p>
<p>Jorge Soler is benched for not hustling by the Daytona manager.  We talk about this discipline and consider the Soler red flags.  </p>
<p>We then dive into a discussion that a lot of fans of bad teams probably have.  Should we find solace in the losses knowing that it ensures a better draft pick?  </p>
<p>We answer a few listener submitted questions, Kurt gives us the Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest. </p>
