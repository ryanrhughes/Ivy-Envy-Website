    Good Luck Corey, Kurt et al,
    I've been listening to your podcasts in Melbourne Australia for several years since I caught the Cubbie bug during a trip to Chicago a few years ago.
    I'm feeling quite inspired at the moment, hence this comment.
    I wish all of you and Cubs fans across the globe the best of luck this year. It is a truly exciting time.
    Best regards,
    George from Melbourne

On this episode, we recap the Pirates series and look ahead to this weekend's series with the Nationals at Wrigley.  </p>
<p>We check in on the injured Cubs players, discuss Jorge Soler's struggles, answer some listener questions, and Andy gives us a Rube Waddell story of the week.  </p>
