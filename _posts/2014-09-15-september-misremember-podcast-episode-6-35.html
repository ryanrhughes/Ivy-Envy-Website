<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>A few weeks ago, we had high hopes for the month of September.  The prospects were coming up and we were going to get a good glimpse at the 2015 Cubs.  Things haven't gone as planned and it's been downright miserable.  On this episode, we discuss where our heads are with the 2014 Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>The Kane County Cougars are the 2014 Midwest League Champions and the Daytona Cubs come up short in the Florida State League playoffs.  We talk about the impact this minor league post-season experience can have on players.  We also briefly discuss the future of both of these teams in the Cubs organization.  </p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions, Kurt gives a scary stat of the week, we read some internet muscle flexes and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
