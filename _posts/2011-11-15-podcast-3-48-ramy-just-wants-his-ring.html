<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt look at the progress in the Cubs' managerial search, which includes a new candidate - DeMarlo Hale. &nbsp;Aramis Ramirez's agent goes public with how hurt Aramis was by Bob Brenly's comments about his decline. &nbsp;Apparently "Ramy" just wants his ring.</p>
<p>Zambrano meets with Epstein and will have the opportunity to earn his way back on the team. &nbsp;Then we pick a (first time) winner for this week's photo caption contest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
