<p>Ivy Envy will be having it's first meet-up for Cubs fans at Twenty Sports Grille, which is located at 1405 5th Avenue in Moline, Illinois.&nbsp; The Cubs are playing the Nationals that night at 7pm and we'll start things up a little before the first pitch.</p>
<p>We will also be recording a podcast episode, so this is your chance to see how the magic happens. &nbsp; Twenty will have 16 oz. Cubs aluminum bottles for $3.50.&nbsp; They also have 20 beers on tap and serve your beverage in the appropriate pint glass.</p>
<p>We'd like to hang out and BS about the Cubs with you.&nbsp; At some point in the evening, all in attendance will be able to put their names in and we will draw for a $50 gift card to Twenty.&nbsp; Come on down and bring your friends that are Cubs fans.</p>
