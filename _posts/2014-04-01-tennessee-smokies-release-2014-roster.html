<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Smokies.gif"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Smokies-300x175.gif" alt="Smokies" width="300" height="175" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9481" /></a>The Tennessee Smokies may be the hottest ticket in minor league baseball in 2014.  <a href="http://theminorleaguereport.com" target="_blank">The Minor League Report</a> is a podcast that covers MiLB and <a href="http://theminorleaguereport.com/66" target="_blank">they recently ranked</a> the Iowa Cubs and the Tennessee Smokies in top 5 when they ranked their top teams in MiLB.  Iowa was #1 and Tennessee was #5.  While Javier Baez plays a huge role in Iowa being ranked #1, I believe Tennessee is potentially a more interesting team than even Iowa.  </p>
<p>Tennessee will start with 3 of the top 5 Cubs prospects in the system, according to Baseball America.  Kris Bryant (#2 Cubs/#8 overall), CJ Edwards (#3 Cubs/#28 overall) and Jorge Soler (#5 Cubs/#41 overall) will start 2014 in Tennessee.  When you also consider that three more prospects in the Cubs top 10 could move up to Tennessee from Daytona (Almora, Candelario and Vogelbach), I think Tennessee is the hottest ticket in MiLB in 2014.  </p>
<p>Tennessee <a href="http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140330&content_id=70451146&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t553&sid=t553" target="_blank">has released their initial roster</a> and here it is:</p>
