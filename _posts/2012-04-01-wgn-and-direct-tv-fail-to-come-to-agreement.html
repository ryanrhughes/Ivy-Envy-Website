  content: I've had Dish Network for about five years. No complaints from me. The
    monthly bill is actually cheaper than DirecTV. You can't get extra innings, but
    if you don't need to watch A's vs. Mariners games you'll get all the Cubs games&nbsp;except
    WCIU. If the DirecTV battle goes on too long it's worth considering to avoid Mediacom.&nbsp;

    Maybe they just hated "New Adventures of Old Christine"&nbsp; I find myself in that category a lot of the time.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    To be honest with you I don't really have a problem with Mediacom as long as I don't have to talk to them.&nbsp; Thankfully, you can't get a real person on the phone anymore to save your life so that's not really an issue.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    MLBtv would be nice if I liked Cal Ripken or didn't have a job so I could actually feel like I wasn't being screwed out of my money.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    I would be interested to find out why Tribune Broadcasting has an interest in the Philadelphia market.&nbsp; Do they own the Inquirer or something?

<p><em><strong>Not an April Fool's joke.  We're not a lame enough blog to do an April Fool's post.</strong></em></p>
<p>After two months of negotiations and claims and denials of agreements, the deadline has passed and WGN has pulled it's programming from DirecTV.  I can assume for most people around the country, unless they are huge fans of Matlock, In the Heat of the Night, Walker Texas Ranger or New Adventures of Old Christine fans, this means one thing - televised Cubs games.  </p>
<p>If, like me, you are one of the nearly 20 million DirecTV subscribers, you will see this on your television this morning. </p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2012/04/Direct-TV1.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2012/04/Direct-TV1-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="Direct TV" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6990" /></a></center></p>
<p>The dispute was over the fact that Tribune Company has never received retransmission fees for their local stations, which would be the local CW and Fox affiliates in the Chicago area.  According to reports, the fees for these local stations have been agreed upon.  However, DirecTV and The Tribune Company have been unable to agree on the terms for WGN America.  </p>
<p>If you are in the Chicago area, all of the stations owned and operated by the Tribune Company have been pulled, which means programs like American Idol will not be broadcast to DirecTV subscribers in the Chicago area.  </p>
<p>I would assume that anyone reading IvyEnvy.com would be much more concerned with the fact that Opening Day and the first WGN Cubs broadcast is four days away.  If a deal is not reached and WGN does not return to DirecTV, between WCIU and WGN broadcasts, Direct TV subscribers will miss 75 Cubs broadcasts.  </p>
<p>I spoke with DirecTV this morning, and as you can imagine, they are taking a lot of phone calls about this situation.  We have been with Direct TV for longer than the 2-year agreement, so if we decided to cancel our service, there would be no penalty.  If you cancel before the 2-year agreement is up, you are penalized $20 per month that you did not fulfill in the contract.  We moved to DirecTV from our local cable provider, Mediacom, and have not looked back.  I love the channel selection and their customer service is out of this world.  I have spoken with representatives many times and have never had to wait to get a representative on the phone.  I've never been put on hold, and I've never had a question not answered or a problem not resolved.  </p>
<p>So this puts me in an unfortunate predicament.  I have no desire to leave DirecTV, but also have no desire to miss Cubs games.  Subscribing to MLB.tv or MLB Extra Innings is not an option for me, as I live within the MLB blackout region for the Cubs.  My favorite bar to go to for Cubs games, Twenty Sports Grille, won't be an option because they also have DirecTV.  </p>
<p>While we here at Ivy Envy are, of course, focused on the impact this has on us Cubs fans, there are other baseball fans impacted by this.  Obviously, WGN carries many White Sox games.  Mets fans in New York would miss the broadcasts of the 25 games that are broadcast on WPIX-TV.  Phillies fans in Philadelphia would miss the 46 games which are broadcasts on WPHL-TV.  WPIX-TV and WPHL-TV are both owned by the Tribune Company.  </p>
<p>Hopefully, Tribune Company and DirecTV can get this worked out and Cubs broadcasts (and Matlock re-runs) will not be effected.  If you feel that, as a subscriber, you have a voice in this, feel free to contact Direct TV or Tribune Company.  </p>
