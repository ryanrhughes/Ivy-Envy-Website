<p>In a televised press conference today, the Cubs introduce fans to their new ace, Jon Lester. The press conference was held Spiaggia restaurant on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago. Here are some of the highlights of the press conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theo Epstein mentions Lester makes the Cubs better on the field, better in the clubhouse and better in the community. &nbsp;&nbsp;This signing marks a transition, the start of a period where they are very serious about bringing a world series to the Cubs and their fans.</li>
<li>Lester is presented a jersey, he will wear #34.</li>
<li>Lester consulted with Jason Hammel and Jeff Samardzija (among others) about the city of Chicago and the Cubs organization.</li>
<li>The fact the Cubs have not one in so long was enticing for Lester to sign with the Cubs.</li>
<li>When asked about difficulty of decision to come to Cubs, "I believe in the plan these guys have."</li>
<li>On challenges of pitching at Wrigley - "There are advantages and disadvantages and you just gotta roll with it as you go."</li>
<li>On the free agency process, being courted by several teams - "That's the fun, exciting time. You get to hear different philosophies." &nbsp;Says the decision was made hours before it was announced.</li>
<li>On filling role as leader on young team - "I'm never going to say 'Hey look at me, I'm your leader', I am going to put my head down and go to work and try to do everything to succeed. &nbsp;I want to lead this team the best I can, in the way that I know how."</li>
<li>Bruce Levine asked how much of his decision was based on "blind faith" in Jed and Theo. &nbsp;"I think these guys did a good job of presenting me with all of the information and the information that was left out, I have people that filled those holes." &nbsp;"I believe in these guys."</li>
<li>On extra scrutiny over size of contract - "I played in Boston for eight years. &nbsp;I think I'm pretty prepared for a lot of things."</li>
<li>Lester invites his son to sit on his lap for remainder of the press conference.</li>
<li>On transition to the NL - "It'll take me some while to get used to." &nbsp;"We'll figure it out as we go."</li>
<li>According to Theo,&nbsp;if Cubs hadn't finished on a good note in 2014 and did not have some of the prospects they have, &nbsp;Lester may not have chosen the Cubs.</li>
<li>Lester, more on the decision to come to the Cubs"It's not very often someone like me would come to a last place team. &nbsp;Our belief is they won't be in last place for very much longer and we're excited for that." &nbsp;"I wouldn't have come here if I didn't believe we're going to win in 2015 - that's the division, that's the World Series".</li>
<li>Lester says that it would have been tougher for him to leave Boston if they hadn't traded him to the A's in 2014. &nbsp;"That broke that barrier of wondering if I can play for another team."</li><br />
