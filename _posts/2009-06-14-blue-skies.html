<p>Well, partly cloudy.&nbsp; There has been a lot to talk about over the past few games, and much of it is negative.&nbsp; I'm not going to think about it, though.&nbsp; I'm heading to Chicago today to see the final game of the Cubs-Twins series.&nbsp; All signs point to slump buster today--Ted is pitching, and the Twins have the hittable Scott Baker on the mound.&nbsp; And I guaran-damn-tee that the Cubs players are counting the number of outs today.&nbsp; I will post tomorrow about my game experience.</p>
