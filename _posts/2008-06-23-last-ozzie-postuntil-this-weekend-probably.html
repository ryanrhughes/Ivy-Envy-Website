  content: I think Corey needs to write something good about Ramirez.  I mean who
    else had 4 home runs and batted in 8 during a three game series?  Also he has
    more home runs against the White Sox than any AL team, which has a much better
    chance since they play them much more.   Come on Corey, eat some crow!

    You know, you're right Cindy.
    I will work diligently on a pro-Ramirez post.

    The biggest thing I've noticed this year is how good he actually is in the field.  He had a couple of great plays last night, too.

<p>After watching Ozzie and his pathetic White Sox crumble to the Cubs, I think I realized why Ozzie makes such foolish and inflammatory statements.&nbsp; I have two theories:&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-104"></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ozzie Jackass Theory #1:</span></strong></p>
<p>Ozzie is "taking one for the team".&nbsp; By keeping himself in the forefront, he is taking the heat off his players that are under-performing and look like the mediocre AL Central team that they are.&nbsp; He has the interest of the players in mind and believes that taking the heat would better serve his club.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ozzie Jackass Theory #2:</span></strong></p>
<p>Ozzie's ego is so huge that he must be the center of attention.&nbsp; If his team is playing poorly, he feels the need to call out his own GM, throw his own players under the bus, criticize the opposing team, complain about the popularity of the Cubs in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this is the case.&nbsp; His team is not performing and they are about to lose control of the AL Central to the Twins.&nbsp; He's not being portrayed in the media like the top manager of the best team in Chicago, so he has to lash out like a little kid.&nbsp; He has to belittle his opponents and criticize their popularity.</p>
<p>I just can't wait until the Ozzie/White Sox romance is over.&nbsp; I guarantee that it will end ugly on the South Side.&nbsp; I can't see Ozzie leaving without defending himself to the extreme.&nbsp;</p>
