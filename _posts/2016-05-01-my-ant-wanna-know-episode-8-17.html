Rain and crummy weather has imposed it's will on baseball games at Wrigley this week.  For the 2<sup>nd</sup> straight series, the Cubs and opponents were only able to complete two games.  </p>
<p>We use a shortened series with the Braves as an opportunity to focus on some of the players that have been performing very well, but we haven't spent much time on yet this year.  We mainly focus on the bullpen and the bench players.  </p>
<p>We have several scary stats and internet muscle flexes to share on this episode.  </p>
