<p>This has been a dismal road trip for the Cubs.&nbsp; This streak of seven losses is the longest since '06.&nbsp; The Cubs scored five runs during this six-game road trip.&nbsp; I keep watching every game, hoping that particular game will be the one the offense breaks out.&nbsp; But it isn't time to pack the W Flag away in a mothball-filled box just yet.&nbsp; The Cubs will be beginning a three-game series at home versus the Pirates tonight.&nbsp; Sounds like the ingredients for a win streak to me.&nbsp; Here's what the Cubs need to do to put together a string of wins:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to swing the bats like they were in San Diego.&nbsp; "What?!? You must be out of your $@#* mind," you say.&nbsp; Well, hear me out.&nbsp; The Cubs hit a boatload of balls to the warning track at PETCO Park.&nbsp; Len and Bob constantly mentioned how the ball does not tend to carry in San Diego due to the climate.&nbsp; However, when the wind is blowing out at Wrigley, games can turn into a derby in short order.&nbsp; PETCO is also ridiculously more spacious than Wrigley.&nbsp; It is 400 feet to left-center and right-center at PETCO, while it is only 368 feet to left-center and right-center at Wrigley.&nbsp; Though Reed Johnson's two-run homer in the last game was nice to see, I would've really liked to see the Cubs trying to swing for base hits more in the series with the Padres.&nbsp; Many of them were still stubbornly swinging for the fences, despite the heavy air and an agoraphobic's nightmare of a baseball field.&nbsp; However, many of the balls that were caught by the outfielders at PETCO would have been homers at Wrigley.&nbsp; So that is why I say, "Go ahead and swing away now, you knucklenobs."</li>
<li>Continue to pitch the same way they have been.&nbsp; I think Len and Bob said that going into yesterday's game, the starters had a 3.15 era on the road trip.&nbsp; That is pitching that wins games... usually.&nbsp; Keep it up, starters!</li>
<li>Keep trying to play loose.&nbsp; It was nice to see the team wearing their mohawk-style rally caps on Saturday.&nbsp; The inning in which Lee hit his homer seemed like it was going to be the Cubs' breakthrough inning, and it was due in part to them trying to have fun.&nbsp; They need more of that.</li><br />
</ul><br />
These next couple of weeks seem like a perfect setup for a reversal of fortune for the Cubs.&nbsp; They have this series against the Pirates, the Dodgers this weekend, and in the near future, series with the Reds and the Astros.&nbsp; Time to make it happen.</p>
