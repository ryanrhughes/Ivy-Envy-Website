  content: So, you're into Ted Lilly. &nbsp;That's cool. &nbsp;But why he he holding
    hands with Molina in that pic? &nbsp;Was that staged by the blog people as click
    bait?

<p>My favorite Cubs player after Ryne Sandberg is Ted Lilly. &nbsp;Believe it or not, I've gotten some grief for this Lilly-affinity over the years. &nbsp;In fact, here is a recent Twitter exchange with a friend of Ivy Envy, Doug.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>&ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/JustDoug77">@JustDoug77</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/HaplessCaptain">@HaplessCaptain</a> Travis Wood >>>>>>> Ted Lilly and it's not up for debate&rdquo; Maybe equal, but all those "greater thans" =madness</p>

<p>Since I get to see and perhaps meet Ted this weekend at Cubs Convention, I thought it would be interesting for me to try to justify my choice of TL as one of my favorites. &nbsp;It can be hard to rationalize something that really is fairly irrational, but here&nbsp;are my reasons for liking him anyway--</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. The Ted Lilly Fan Club</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The TLFC was a blog that followed Ted's exploits throughout his Cubs tenure and treated him as though he were a demigod. &nbsp;Follow <a href="http://wiklifield.thecubreporter.com/Ted_Lilly" target="_blank">this link</a>, and read the brief article to get the flavor of the TLFC.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. I enjoy crafty pitching.</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first video here shows (in slow motion) the great fade that Lilly had on his changeup. &nbsp;The second video features Ted's control, his devastating slow curve, his luck, and the voice of Vin Scully.</p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;3. Lilly&nbsp;was a great competitor and teammate.</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of Ted's actions could perhaps be construed as petulant (e.g. slamming his glove on the mound or the confrontation with Gibbons), but I don't think anyone could say that he didn't care. &nbsp;He wanted to win, and he wanted his teammates to win. &nbsp;He was ejected a couple of times for shouting at the umpire from the dugout because he didn't care for his fellow pitchers getting squeezed.</p><br />

<p>He also could be pretty funny--I wrote a post in 2009 about a game I watched in which <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/the-moth-whisperer/" target="_blank">Lilly placed a giant moth on the cap of coach Gerald Perry</a>.</p>
<p><strong>4. This--</strong></p>

<p>I think I'm feeling good about my choice. &nbsp;I didn't even get into stats, and&nbsp;it is true that there aren't any really gaudy numbers there. &nbsp;Still, he is a two-time All-Star, and he went 47-34 in his tenure with the cubs, including 15-win and 17-win seasons in 2007 and 2008. &nbsp;TMFL!</blockquote><br />
