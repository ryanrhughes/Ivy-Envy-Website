  spent another morning at Fitch Park watching the minor leaguers run drills when
  Corey runs in to a very large Venezuelan named Carlos. Then it was off to meet Tim
  Sheridan at Hohokam stadium for a quick tour and the Cubs vs. A's. Tim was nice
  enough to let us take in the last two innings from the PA booth. Stayed tuned for
  our interview with Tim in our next podcast.\r\n\r\nClick through to see all of the
