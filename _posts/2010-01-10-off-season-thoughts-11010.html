<p>*&nbsp;<strong> Randy Johnson has retired after 22 seasons.</strong></p>

<p>I have always liked Randy Johnson.&nbsp; He's a sure-bet for the Hall of Fame and it's pretty safe to say that in my lifetime, he's dominated the world of pitching and mullets.&nbsp; He was a 10-time All Star, 5-time Cy Young Winner (won in both NL and AL) and finished with 303 wins.&nbsp; Johnson led the Majors in strikeouts in 9 seasons.&nbsp; He retires 2nd, only behind Nolan Ryan, in career strikeouts.&nbsp; Randy Johnson was a Cubs-killer, though.&nbsp; In that respect, I'm glad to see him go.&nbsp; But I always enjoyed watching him, and his dominance is something that you see only in a few players in your lifetime.&nbsp; My favorite Randy Johnson memory is him facing John Kruk in the 1993 All-Star game.&nbsp; By the way, I hate the fact that MLB clips are so difficult to find on the internet.&nbsp; My other favorite memory of Johnson pitching is pretty obvious:</p>

<p>*&nbsp; <strong>The Cardinals signed Matt Holliday for 7 years and $120 million. </strong></p>
<p>The Cardinals would not have made it to the playoffs in the 2009 season without Matt Holiday.&nbsp; Of course, the Cardinals had a chance in the playoffs until James Loney hit a flyball to Holliday.</p>

<p>Holliday is a very good player.&nbsp; I am not sure the Cardinals made the right move.&nbsp; I'm assuming that Albert Pujols played a major role in this.&nbsp; He probably told the Cardinals that if they want to keep him, they need to stay competitive and they need to protect him in the lineup.&nbsp; The length of the contract really surprised me.&nbsp; I think this was a major mistake by the Cardinals, but since it's the Cardinals...I'm all for anything that will hurt them.&nbsp;&nbsp; It creates a weird situation for a team that is in a small market and likes to conduct itself like an efficient small market team.&nbsp;&nbsp; My prediction:&nbsp; The Cardinals get a few good seasons out of Holliday (nothing like he was for them in 2009) and it keeps Pujols in St. Louis.&nbsp; His fielding abilities will drop and he'll be moved to a corner outfield position.&nbsp; His batting will decrease and then the Cardinals will be stuck with a guy earning a ridiculous salary that should be&nbsp; DH in the American League.&nbsp; I can only hope he will be to Cardinals fans what Soriano is to us.</p>
