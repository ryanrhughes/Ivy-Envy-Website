<p>Nearly unwatchable.&nbsp; I do like a pitchers' duel just as much as the next guy, but good lord.&nbsp; Can we get some offense?&nbsp; I want to see someone be clutch.&nbsp; We came up short on Soto's liner to end the Houston game on Sunday, but at least that game was fun to watch.&nbsp; These past two games in this series remind me of <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=151" target="_blank">a post I wrote last season</a>.&nbsp; The Cubs have picked up the icy bats and can't seem to put them down.&nbsp; Who will be our guy tomorrow to get that offense rolling?&nbsp; I think it might have to be Farney.&nbsp; The Cards fans I run into at work are starting to get a little smug, and we won't see the Cardinals again until July.&nbsp; Please, Farney, we need a win tomorrow.</p>
