<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the last week's events with the Cubs.  Injured players are piling up and we give you our opinions on which injured player the Cubs will miss the most.  The Cubs made a historic trip to Fenway and a little guy named Tony Campana made his Cubs debut.  Since MLB is pushing it on us, we look ahead to the All-Star Game and which player should represent the Cubs.  </p>
<p>After the break, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week.  We read up a few listener-suggested topics that include the worst baseball injuries we've seen, Jim Hendry's future with the Cubs and our reaction to Quade's facial expressions.  We also display our ability to be distracted as we are, once again, joined by a raccoon.  Here's our little buddy and the view from our current "studio".<br />
