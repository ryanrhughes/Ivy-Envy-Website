<p>The Cubs General Manager appeared on the MLB Network's show <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/network/shows/?id=25775158" target="_blank">"Clubhouse Confidential"</a> tonight to discuss the state of Cubs and the direction he and Theo Epstein plan to take the organization.</p>
<p>On Theo Epstein compensation deal:  </p>
<blockquote><p>"Both sides went into it firing into the dark.  I think the result was good.  I think Boston gets a very good reliever.  I think we get a great leader of our baseball department.  It certainly was a long and winding road."</blockquote></p>
<p>Why didn't the Cubs go after big-name free agents in the off-season?</p>
<blockquote><p>"It wasn't the right time.  In order to big-game hunt, you've got to have a really nice foundation underneath you.  We can do that someday.  We're certainly going to have the resources to do it.  We need to build up our infrastructure really well and have a ton of good, young players.  You want that big-game hunting to be that cornerstone piece, that crowning piece that puts you over the edge.  We don't feel right now like we're at that point.  We want to make sure when we do that, it's the right timing.  Let's build a foundation and infrastructure and once we get that done, we can go after the players like that."</blockquote></p>
<p>When asked about Dale Sveum what the role of the manager is in the modern game:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I know some people like to try to minimize the importance of the manager and say there's only a handful of strategic moves per game that make a difference.  I think the way the manager sets the tone for the players and sets a tone for the clubhouse is so important, and it can't be minimized at all.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>What do you see in Anthony Rizzo?</p>
<blockquote><p>"He's got great make-up, he's got big power and he's already had success at Double-A and Triple-A at age 21.  He's got some development left.  He's not a finished product.  We really liked Cashner a ton, but we felt he's probably going to be a dominant reliever and we felt that the opportunity to get that middle-of-the-order bat.  That's the right thing for us to do right now.  It's a baseball trade - a guy with a great arm for a guy with a ton of power.  </blockquote></p>
<p>How different will the roster look at the end of the year?</p>
<blockquote><p>"We don't have that foundation that we were talking about, but I think you always want to give yourself a conscience chance to win and I think we've certainly done that.  If you look at our rotation, we brought in a lot of guys that we control, a lot of guys that are coming off a little bit of a down-year, like a Wood or a Volstad.  But I think we have a chance to win and I hope we do.   You never know when you're going to have that magic year, when you'll have a lot of guys step up.  We'll never concede a given season.  But we're not in the place where we can go big-game hunting quite yet."</blockquote></p>
<p>Hoyer's statements shouldn't surprise anyone that recognizes the long-term goals set by this team.  The Ricketts/Epstein/Hoyer/McLeod team seem absolutely focused on building this organization up from the ground the right way.  I am thrilled to see this foundation being constructed, rather than a championship run based on throwing money at the short-term.  </p>
