<p>We are having a game-watch at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline, tonight.&nbsp; Twenty has lots of tv's, so we'll watch the Cubs play the Marlins and the Blackhawks attempt to wrap-up their series with Vancouver.</p>
<p>Twenty is located at 1405 5th Avenue in downtown Moline, IL.&nbsp; They have great food and drinks and it's a nice place to watch the Cubs.</p>
<p>You can find our future game-watches under the "Live Events" tab on our header.&nbsp; We'll be doing these once a month.</p>
<p>So come on down and commiserate with other Cubs fans.</p>
