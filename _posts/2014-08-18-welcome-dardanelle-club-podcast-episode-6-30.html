    "Welcome to the Dardanelle Club" - Podcast Episode 6.30 - IvyEnvy.com
---
<p>There were lots of Chicago Cubs roster changes to talk about on this week's episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  Dan Straily gets called up for a Cubs spot start.  Matt Szczur comes up and brings some speed to the team.  We'll talk about what the future may hold for Szczur as a member of the Chicago Cubs.  If you'd like to hear an interview that I did with Matt Szczur in the spring of 2012, you can <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-06-bonus-interview-episodematt-szczur/" target="_blank">listen to it here</a>. </p>
<p>Junior Lake was demoted and we talk about the struggles he experienced and discuss where he may start in 2015.  The Brett Jackson era has ended for the Cubs.  We talk about his career with the Cubs and use it as an opportunity to compare the top prospects of a few years ago and the top prospects of today.  </p>
<p>Kris Bryant is day-to-day with an injury and we talk about the grind of a full season of professional baseball and later in the show, muscle flexes call Bryant out for being "injury prone."</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions that involve pitching, offense, radio broadcasts and beer.  Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week involves strikeouts. </p>
<p>During the episode, someone in the chat asked for our personal Twitter handles.  If you'd like to connect with us on Twitter and other social networks, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/bios/" target="_blank">check out our Bio page</a>. </p>
