<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy look at the fairly decent run by the Cubs in the last week.  We each admit that our interest has increased after the Brewers series and the first few games of the Yankees series.  We look at Darwin Barney's injury and compare it's effect against the other injuries the Cubs have endured this season.  </p>
<p>With the Yankees in town, the Zambrano trade rumors have been flying and we discuss the idea of a Zambrano trade from the perspectives of the Cubs and any other team that might be involved.  On our Facebook page, Jeff asks us what we think of Blake DeWitt hitting in the 3-hole and that leads to some analyzing of the managing in the 9th inning of Saturday's Yankees game.  </p>
<p>Corey steps in and gives a Scary Stat of the Week for Kurt.  Then, we wrap up the show by picking a prize-less winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
