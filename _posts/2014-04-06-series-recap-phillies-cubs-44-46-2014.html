    no matter the situation...yes, it sucks to see him wear another uniform.

Friday: (L) Phillies 7 Cubs 2<br />
Saturday: (L) Phillies 2 Cubs 0<br />
Sunday: (W) Cubs 8 Phillies 3</p>
<p>Cubs Record: 2-4</p>
<p><u><strong>The Good</u></strong><br />
The <strong>starting pitching</strong> continues to carry the Cubs.  In this series, the starters gave up 6 runs in 18<sup>1/3</sup> innings, but only Carlos Villanueva was able to secure a win.  The starters can't take issue with the performance of the bullpen. Their wasted starts are a result of the team's inability to score runs.  </p>
<p>In an explosion of offense in Sunday's game, the <strong>Cubs scored eight runs</strong>.  That total matched the number of runs the team scored in their first 5 games combined.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Bad</u></strong><br />
<strong>Jose Veras</strong> came into Sunday's game in a non-save situation in the 9th inning.  Renteria eventually pulled Veras after he walked four and surrendered two runs.  The Cubs appointed Veras the closer right at the beginning of Spring Training, but if he wants to possess the role, he needs to find the strike zone. </p>
<p><u><strong>The Ugly</u></strong><br />
In this series, the Cubs again had trouble <strong>hitting with runners in scoring position</strong>.  In the first two games of the series, the Cubs went 1-10 with RISP.  The Cubs inability to hit with RISP is nearly statistically impossible.  If you just look at the first two games of both series so far, they are 2-37 with RISP.  Here's to hoping their offensive output on Sunday, and the warmer forecast will help the Cubs get things rolling.  </p>
