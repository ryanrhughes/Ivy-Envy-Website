<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />We've been waiting for this since last October, it's Cubs playoff baseball!  In this episode, we're previewing Game #1 of the NLDS between the Cubs and Giants. We tell you how the Cubs have fared against the Giants this season and how the Cubs players have done against Cueto.  We also look at the Lester vs. Giants match-up.  We share our predictions for the series and Game #1. </p>
<p>We'll broadcast live Friday night after Game #1 and share our thoughts on how the game went, and preview Game #2.  We will all three be at Game #2, so there won't be a live post-game show after that game, but we'll record a Game #2 recap and Game #3 preview episode on Sunday night.  </p>
<p>Deep breaths, Cubs fans...and #LetsGo!</p>
