  content: "[...] I&#8217;m glad to see Milton Bradley come back to the team while
    they are on the road. Right now, I don&#8217;t trust Cubs fans to be level-headed
    enough to realize that booing and heckling Bradley does not help him, or more
    importantly, this team in any way. As long as he wears a blue hat with a red &#8220;C&#8221;
    on it, I want him to turn things around.&nbsp; If he needs a standing ovation
    every time he comes to the plate to get some confidence back, I&#8217;ll support
    it. He will hit. The guy hit .321 last season and played well in Spring Training.
    His bat will warm up. I just hope that he hasn&#8217;t been written off by everyone
    at that point like Jacque Jones was in 2007. This is a small slice of a lively
    conversation we had in Episode #6 of the podcast. [...]"

<p>This is the first episode from the Backyard Bar and we have plenty to discuss.&nbsp; Topics include: the recent poor play by the Cubs, lack of offense, a scary bullpen, injuries and a somewhat fueled conversation about Milton Bradley.</p>
