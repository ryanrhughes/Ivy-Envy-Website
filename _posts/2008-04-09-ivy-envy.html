<p>Welcome to Ivy Envy.</p>
<p>We are a group of guys that are lifelong Cubs fans. At this time, there are six authors. Five of us are from Illinois and one is a Californian. We are using this forum to discuss everything Cubs-related. This will not be where you go for up-to-the-second news from the clubhouse, but we do hope to inform and entertain. You will get six opinions and points of view.</p>
<p>This site will change over time, and perhaps in the matter of days. &nbsp;Things will improve and we&rsquo;ll be able to add features to make it more of a "one stop shop".</p>
<p>To start this blog, I have asked the authors to introduce themselves and tell you about their experience with the Cubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make yourself at home and we encourage you to participate.</p>
