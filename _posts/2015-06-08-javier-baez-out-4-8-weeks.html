<p>Javier Baez, as has been well-documented, had slid over from his normal middle infield confines to get reps over at the hot corner &ndash; a move that seemed likely to precede a call up to Chicago and the big league squad.</p>
<p>Indeed, with the Cubs preparing for two upcoming Interleague series with designated hitters in play, the timing seemed to be lining up for Baez to get a well deserved second shot at the majors within the next week, if not earlier.</p>
<p>Baez has calmed his approach at the plate recently, decreasing his strikeout rate to a very palatable 25% and not losing any of his trademark raw power in doing so. He proved as much <span>Saturday</span> night, blasting a two-run homer off the light tower in deep left field, salvaging an otherwise quiet night from the I-Cubs.</p>
<p>Maybe more impressively, Baez looked comfortable at third base. Strong infield defense from Javy isn&rsquo;t a surprise, but with so few reps there, it was good to see. Notably, the only thing that seemed unnatural about Baez transition to the corner was deferring to the shortstop on pop-ups on the infield, showing off McKayla Maroney-esque &lsquo;Not Impressed&rsquo; body language after allowing Jonathan Mota to snare a pop-up that Baez is used to handling himself.</p>
<p>Baez had his triple slash up to .314/.386/.536 and was checking all the boxes to show he was ready for another chance after a mostly disappointing first try in the MLB.</p>
<p>Then, <span>Sunday</span> night, as Baez was stealing his 7<sup>th</sup> bag of the season, he apparently jammed his left hand, causing a non-displaced fracture in his left ring finger.</p>
<p>Early reports estimate a 4-8 week layoff for Baez, another bad break for the budding prospect after going through the tragic loss of his sister to open the season.</p>
<p>Baez is young and supremely talented and will get another chance soon enough. We can only hope for a speedy recovery and a quick return to form for the kid who will be champing at the bit to join his teammates in Iowa and eventually Chicago. He deserves it."</p>
