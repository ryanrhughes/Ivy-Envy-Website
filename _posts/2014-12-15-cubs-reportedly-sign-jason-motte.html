After the Cubs signed Jon Lester and Jason Hammel, the prevailing opinion is that the Cubs would look for a veteran outfielder and someone to help in the bullpen.  It's being reported that the Cubs have signed Jason Motte to a 1-year deal rumored to be worth $4.5 million.<br />

<p>Cubs agree to terms with reliever Jason Motte on a one year deal, according to a source.</p>&mdash; Jesse Rogers (@ESPNChiCubs) <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNChiCubs/status/544632296608108546">December 15, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>Most Cubs fans are surely familiar with Motte from his years with the Cardinals.  When he's been healthy, he's been effective.  Prior to undergoing Tommy John surgery and missing all of 2013, Motte's fastball averaged almost 97mph and he led the league in saves with 43 in 2012.  Motte returned from the Tommy John surgery in 2014 and pitched in 29 games, also missing some time with a back injury.  </p>
<p>This deal is pending a physical.  We know the history this front office has with Tommy John reclamation projects.  At 26, he is still young and if the Cubs and Bosio are able to get the most out of him, he could be a player the Cubs flip mid-season, especially if the Cubs are not in contention.  </p>
