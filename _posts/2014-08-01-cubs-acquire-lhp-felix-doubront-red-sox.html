<p>As the Cubs expected to be sellers throughout the trading season, they made a move earlier in the week that wasn't a sell off trade. The Cubs acquired left handed pitcher Felix Doubront from the Red Sox for a player to be named later.</p>
<p>Doubront, signed as a free agent in 2005 by Theo Epstein, has gotten bounced from the rotation to the bullpen this season. The lefty earned a spot in the rotation in 2014 after posting an excellent 1.29 ERA in seven innings in the postseason last fall. In his first nine starts, Doubront struggled, going 2-4 with an ERA over five. He was then put in the bullpen and has been up and down. One night the lefty will be perfect in an inning of work and the next he'll get hit around and give up two or three runs in an inning.</p>
<p>His last outing for the Red Sox was on Monday against the Blue Jays. Doubront went two thirds of an inning, giving up six hits and six earned runs. One positive to look at in this deal is Doubront could be looked at as a reclamation, change of scenery project. One name that has popped up is a Jake Arrieta type, falling out of favor with an organization then getting traded and turning it around. It has not been announced where he will start out, but Doubront will probably start out in AAA, like Dan Straily, a trade piece that was acquired earlier in the month.</p>
<p>The 26 year old will try to figure it out in Iowa then be moved up to Chicago when he is ready. Pitching coach Chris Bosio will help Doubront immensely; if it will help, that only time will tell. One thing is for sure, this is not the only move the Cubs are going to make before 3:00 pm EST tomorrow.</p>
