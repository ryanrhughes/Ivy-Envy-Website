  content: I say no. Is he the best we have yes..but I reserve the term "ace" for
    elite pitchers. Verlander, Hamels,  David Price etc. Not every team has one. That
    also doesnt mean he wont be one in the future. Just not now. I wouldn't consider
    Garza a "ace". That being said I think the tougher question is if Dempster is
    a "ace". With that ERA I think there is an argument.

  content: ace or not, he showed he's still got those WR wheels by almost beating
    mccutchen to the bag despite his mishap. i read he throws five pitches. if he
    can learn to control them all consistently, that's a lot for a batter to handle
    each AB. i bet he could get there. his make-up reminds me of a young weaver.

  content: Yea, he's got "ace' stuff as he's showed periodically throughout the season,
    but he has to cut the walks down and handle adversity better and avoid big innings.
    No question he has the tools though...

    are number one receivers

    year and I think he could keep moving in that direction. '

<p>On this last weekend's <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7669" target="_blank">Ivy Envy Podcast episode</a>, we considered a post-Dempster/Garza rotation.  I shared my opinion that if the Cubs were to receive minor league or lower pitching talent, this would leave Jeff Samardzija as the ace of the pitching staff.  </p>
<p>I'm sure that any sentence I utter on the Podcast that contain the words "Jeff Samardzija" induce eye-rolling from some of our listeners.  I'm probably one of the biggest Samardzija homers you will find.  It's a love that goes back many years and has endured some very ugly pitching performances.</p>
<p>With Dempster trade rumors swirling, Samardzija took the mound in Pittsburgh and pitched a gem.  In fact, Jeff was a brain-fart and an inning away from throwing the 2nd Cubs no-hitter in 40 years.  Had Samardzija broken to first base immediately as Anthony Rizzo gloved an Andrew McCutchen ground-ball, Sveum could have been faced with the decision of whether or not to let Samardzija head back out to pitch the 9th inning.  </p>
<p>After the game, Sveum said, "Obviously, I would've sent him back out there if he had covered first base." I really  like that Sveum is using situations like this to instill discipline and motivation in the team.  I'm sure that last night, Samardzija was not reveling in his accomplishment, but rather regretting not breaking towards first-base quicker and having an opportunity that he will likely not get again.  </p>
<p>We've seen some ugly Jeff Samardzija (yeah, I know...he's not a looker) this season, but what we have to keep in mind is this is Samardzija's first full season as a starter.  He is progressing as a pitcher.  He's become more comfortable and productive with his cutter and relies less on his slider. Control has always been a major issue with Samardzija and per nine innings, he is striking out almost nine and walking 3.23.  That walks number has dropped from over five in 2011 and in 2010 (in limited action) it was a staggering 9.31.  </p>
<p>On Monday in Pittsburgh, Samardzija was effective and efficient.  At points this season, and many times throughout his career, Samardzija's pitch-count climbed early.  His last outing was against the Marlins and it took him 97 pitches to get through five innings.  Monday night, Samardzija tossed 99 pitches through 8 innings.  Control was not an issue, as he threw 71 strikes and only walked one.  </p>
<p>Back to the "ace" issue.  I'm not willing to go out and say that Samardzija is ace-material for many teams, but I do think he'd be the ace of this staff if Dempster and Garza are traded.  And like we said on the podcast, if the Cubs continue to sign and acquire lower-salaried pitchers for 2013, I think Samardzija could easily be the ace of the staff heading into Opening Day of 2013.  I'd like to hear what all of you think about this issue.  </p>
