This has been a drawn-out situation with lots of resistance from the rooftops and neighborhoods and lots of altered plans by the Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>Andy, Kurt and I are 3+ hours from Wrigley Field and fairly ignorant of the neighborhood issues and Chicago politics, so we figured we'd bring in someone that is more familiar with how the city works and this renovation situation.  Pat Nagle is one of the hosts of the <a href="http://wrigleyvillenation.com" target="_blank">Wrigleyville Nation Podcast</a>. </p>
<p>Pat is a resident of Wrigleyville and has attended the community meetings with the Cubs.  Pat is also a season ticket holder with the Cubs and understands their need to renovate for the purposes of generating revenue and providing players with better facilities.  </p>
<p>We cover a lot of angles in this discussion and if you're not from Wrigleyville or Chicago, I think you'll enjoy hearing about these issues from the perspective of someone that lives in the neighborhood.  </p>
