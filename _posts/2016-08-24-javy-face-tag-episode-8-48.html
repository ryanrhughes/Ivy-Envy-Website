The Cubs went out to the west coast and swept the Padres in San Diego.  We talk about that series, including the incredible defense of Javier Baez and the offensive production by the entire team, especially Kris Bryant and Addison Russell.  </p>
<p>With lots of positives to talk about, we balance that with an attempt to figure out why Jason Heyward's production has been so poor this year.  We discover a few things that could be contributing to it, but no concrete explanation.  </p>
<p>We throw in some Internet Muscle Flexes and Andy shares a classic Rube Waddell story with us.  </p>
