<p>Source confirms Javier Baez will make his big-league debut with the Cubs tomorrow night at Coors Field.</p>&mdash; Patrick Mooney (@CSNMooney) <a href="https://twitter.com/CSNMooney/statuses/496353737548775424">August 4, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>It's happening.  The pieces are coming together.  The Cubs have promoted Javier Baez, their #2 prospect to the major league team.  The trades of 2<sup>nd</sup> basemenDarwin Barney and Emilio Bonifacio have created an every-day spot for Baez defensively as (also recently called-up) Arismendy Alcantara will presumably shift to center field.  </p>
<p>We Cubs have have not had much to celebrate in years and this feels like a gigantic step towards a contending team, especially considering the numbers that Jorge Soler (who should also join the Cubs this season) is putting up since returning from injury and Kris Bryant has been putting up all season.  </p>
<p>It's been a rough few years and we've got a ways to go, but feel free to get excited about this.</p>
