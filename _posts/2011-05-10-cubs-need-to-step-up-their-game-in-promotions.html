  content: If you find the right vendor, you can definitely "enjoy some Lucha Libre
    wrestling masks."  It just won't be free.  Well if you run fast enough it could
    be free.

  content: "The problem I have with the Guiness Book of World Records is it's full
    of records that don't serve any useful purpose.  Like the ice cream licking thing
    at Augustana...who gives a shit?  I could probably set the record for hitting
    myself over the head with a brick, but who cares?  I could save myself the cranial
    damage if I just changed the information in my letters of recommendation  to say
    \"Is extremely effective at wasting time doing pointless activities\"  I thought
    it was a stupid promotion but it's southern California they could give away free
    chlamydia screenings and the place would be packed to the gills.  \r\n\r\nI will
    take no more calls on this matter, I'm busy.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>I never thought much about the idea of promotions and giveaways at baseball games until I moved to Southern California and went to some Angels games.&nbsp; It was then that I realized how lame the Cubs are at promotions.&nbsp; We always hear Len and Bob pimping the swag that corporations and the Cubs give away.&nbsp; Usually, these are handed out to the first 10,000 people in the gates.&nbsp; I thought that was a typical practice by MLB teams.</p>
<p>The Angels know how to do promotions.&nbsp; While the Cubs are giving away a cheap foam #1 finger to the first 10,000 fans, the Angels are giving away different styles of hats, coolers, backpacks, jerseys, shirts, mugs and best...gumball machines.&nbsp; The Cubs are giving away some decent stuff, but again, it's limited to the first 10,000 people.&nbsp; A couple of years ago, we were vacationing in California and went to an Angels game when they were giving away Angels military style hats.&nbsp; Tawny and I went early and got our hats.&nbsp; My brother-in-law and sister-in-law showed up a bit late and all of the hats were given away.&nbsp; How did the Angels handle the situation in which the advertisements read "All in Attendance"?&nbsp; They had fan services people taking names and addresses.&nbsp; That's right, when the shipment of hats came in, the Angels would mail you your hat.&nbsp; Only the finest customer service to every $8 ticket paying customer.</p>
<p>I doubt the Angels are the only team that goes above and beyond in promotions.&nbsp; And to be honest, I'm not a huge promotions kind of guy.&nbsp; I have only been to one bobblehead game.&nbsp; It was when the Cubs played the Dodgers in LA in 2005 and I got a Cesar Izturis bobblehead.&nbsp; When Izturis was traded to the Cubs the next year, I fantasized about a scenario where Izturis goes on to become a Cubs Hall of Fame shortstop and then I would have his bobblehead (still in the box) with him wearing a Dodgers uniform and the game date/opponent (his future HOF team) printed on the box.&nbsp; That dream was not realized....yet.</p>
<p>I bring up this whole idea of promotions because I pay attention to the Angels.&nbsp; The Angels hope to make history tonight with their promotion for their game against the White Sox.&nbsp; For the second time in as many years, the Angels will make an attempt to break a <strong>Guinness World Record</strong>. Last year, they attempted to set the record for the "largest gathering of people wearing blankets".&nbsp; What record do they have their sights set on this year, you ask?&nbsp; The largest number of people wearing costume masks.&nbsp; That sounds pretty lame until you find out that the Angels will be handing out wrestling masks to everyone in attendance.</p>

<p>Being a Cubs fan is difficult enough, why can't we enjoy some Lucha Libre wrestling masks?</p>
