  content: I road tripped to Boston with my family and saw Fenway for the first time.  Fenway
    is cool - still vintage but with modern amenities (cell phone charging tables?!?!).  But
    Wrigley has Fenway beat in terms of beauty.  Nothing beats the bricks and Ivy.
    I also missed Wrigley's organ music! Plus, there were brown patches of grass on
    Fenway's outfield.  Ugh.  I will say the Boston Fans are awesome - totally into
    the game, cheering for their team with every single pitch.  And "Sweet Caroline"
    was actually pretty neat.

  content: Your article sucks......you are obviously a Cubs fan looking to defend
    his home field. I would say the parks are about equal green monster=ivy, both
    have hand operated scoreboards. The fans at Fenway when I went seem to be much
    better (maybe because the sox actually win) compared to the half filled disinterested
    fans I witnessed at wrigley. The history is there in both parks and I'd say there
    about equal. If I had one baseball game left to watch in my life I'd go to Fenway.
    But Wrigley is a close 2nd.

  content: Let me say this, if you came to Fenway to stretch your legs in the shade,
    drink beer, eat chicken strips and pay $10, then you should have just stayed in
    front of your television. As for the rest of us, we actually go to watch the Red
    Sox play baseball. I have never read a more bloated opinion of a 100+ year old
    ballpark through the eyes of a near sighted, Feng Shui loving Chicagoan who actually
    sat with his wife and counted french fries at a Sox game. I highly recommend you
    take your op ed writing to the next level of journalism, say a travel magazine.
    How about a Conde Nast list of Chicago churches with the best and worst communal
    wines? That article was wicked awful!

<p>Only two hallowed halls have survived the big money game of Major League Baseball: Wrigley Field, of course, and its 102-year-old American League counterpart in Boston.</p>
<p>But while both parks enjoy legendary status &mdash; drawing tourists more for its history than the teams that play upon it &mdash; I&rsquo;m here to tell you that all things are not equal in these century-old stadiums.</p>
<p>Hang onto your Dunkin Donuts, Red Sox fans: Fenway Park is a miserable place to watch a game.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m surprise more people aren&rsquo;t talking about it. Meanwhile, Wrigley Field continues to get picked on.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because Wrigley is in an ugly renovation battle between stubborn rooftop owners and a front office that wants to do something about the park&rsquo;s relative decrepitness.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because the Red Sox have won three World Series titles in 10 years, taking the spotlight off a stadium that features only a few good seats in the house.</p>
<p>Most likely it&rsquo;s my detachment from the American League &mdash; and the fact that I&rsquo;ve been to Fenway once &mdash; that solidifies this perception.</p>
<p>But like a good political pundit, shallow experience on the topic isn&rsquo;t going to stop me from writing this review.</p>
<p>Having finally made the pilgrimage to Fenway Park on Monday, June 30, I left feeling the need to stick up for Wrigley&rsquo;s vastly more sound ballpark despite my hypocritical rant against it <a href="y-birthday-wrigley-field-use-plastic-surgery-youre-showing-age/">in a previous blog post</a>.</p>
<p>I went to Boston with seriously high hopes, at one point telling my wife that this could be the &ldquo;second-most awesomest&rdquo; live baseball experience of my life (Game 2 of the 2003 NLCS is still the best).</p>
<p>But had it not been for Jake Arrieta&rsquo;s near no-hitter, I would have left feeling extremely annoyed.</p>
<p>For disclosure&rsquo;s sake, we sat in the grandstand &mdash; the cheapest seats. But they still cost $50 apiece, so I don&rsquo;t feel bad complaining.</p>
<p>To honor the Cubs sweep of the BoSox in Beantown, here&rsquo;s a scornful review of Fenway Park as compared to the Friendly Confines in five key areas.</p>
<h2>View</h2><br />
[caption id="attachment_10190" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="/uploads/2014/07/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-10190" src="/uploads/2014/07/photo-300x225.jpg" alt="This was our ... view? ... from the grandstand seats at Fenway Park during the Cubs and Red Sox game on June 30, 2014." width="300" height="225" /></a> This was our ... view? ... from the grandstand seats at Fenway Park during the Cubs and Red Sox game on June 30, 2014.[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Fenway Park:</strong> This picture my wife took is kind of hilarious. This was our view for the first four innings. Sometimes you can&rsquo;t avoid the sun. I get that. But it&rsquo;s the second photo that locks in what I&rsquo;m talking about.</p>
<p>This is your view if you look straight forward. What do I mean here? I&rsquo;m telling you that if you sit in the grandstand seats at Fenway, you have to crank your head left like you&rsquo;re checking a blind spot while changing lanes on the Eisenhower. Try it for three hours. It&rsquo;s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Wrigley Field:</strong> OK, so you might sit behind a post once in a while. And the top row of the terrace reserve section underneath the mezzanine suites is a pretty awful spot. But at least you&rsquo;re facing the action.</p>
<h2>Logistics</h2><br />
[caption id="attachment_10191" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="/uploads/2014/07/IMG_6056.jpg"><img class="wp-image-10191 size-medium" src="/uploads/2014/07/IMG_6056-300x225.jpg" alt="Fenway_view2" width="300" height="225" /></a> This is the view from the grandstand if you want to, you know, look forward.[/caption]</p>
<p><strong>Fenway Park:</strong> So, here I&rsquo;m talking about the simple ability to feel unencumbered in your seat and get around the park. The grandstand seats are still the wooden fold-down style. The leg room is nil. And to top it off, since everyone is shifting to see the action, you find yourself constantly unbinding your arms from your sweat-soaked neighbor.</p>
<p>It makes peeling noise, I swear.</p>
<p>Also, leaving your seat is a pain. Since there&rsquo;s no leg room, you&rsquo;re bothering almost a dozen people (if you are in the unfortunate middle seat of the row) when you get up.</p>
<p>Getting back to your seat is just as bad. If you want to be respectful and wait until between innings, a kind usher will tell you to &ldquo;Keep it movin&rsquo;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stand in the ballpark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;M&rsquo;k.</p>
<p><strong>Wrigley Field:</strong> The middle seat is always terrible, and I&rsquo;ll be more cognizant of it from now on. But I swear there&rsquo;s more room to move at Wrigley. I&rsquo;ve never felt completely claustrophobic.</p>
<h2>Concessions</h2><br />
<strong>Fenway Park:</strong> Quite easily the worst concessions of the 11 Major League stadiums I&rsquo;ve visited. We didn&rsquo;t see a beer man the entire game, and there is one beer stand and one concession stand for nearly the entire grandstand.</p>
<p>I waited almost a full inning to get a beer ($9.75), and then another full inning for food. I got a steak and cheese sandwich ($7.75) that was composed of over-cooked, crunchy, shredded meat on a grade-school cafeteria hot dog bun. My wife got two small, stale chicken strips on top of 15 french fries ($9). Side note: You can get an awesome cheesesteak for $10 at Citizen&rsquo;s Bank in Philly.</p>
<p><strong>Wrigley Field:</strong> The beer comes in a larger cup since they&rsquo;re made to fit &ldquo;tall boys,&rdquo; so you already have more suds for your buck. The hot dogs are Vienna beef. When I still living in Illinois a few years ago, you could get there early and get a personal Connie&rsquo;s pizza for a reasonable price. And the beer man is never too far away.</p>
<h2>Parking</h2><br />
<strong>Fenway Park:</strong> Don&rsquo;t drive. Just, don&rsquo;t. Fenway is right off a major interstate, and while you might get in, I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll never get out. Unlike Wrigley, Fenway has several parking garages nearby. But, oddly enough, they are so close to the ballpark, you have to leave three innings early unless you want to be trapped in the garage. They let departing fans walk in the streets with no crowd control, clogging all methods of exit. I was baffled as to why hundreds of fans left in the seventh inning of a two-run game with a no-hit bid on the line. Then I walked outside.</p>
<p><strong>Wrigley Field:</strong> Parking sucks, yes. But having seen how poorly parking garages work in a neighborhood-locked stadium has me rethinking my fervent call for a garage near Wrigley. They don&rsquo;t work. Keep the parking lots away from the park and spread them out. That&rsquo;s the only way driving will be tolerable.</p>
<h2>Public Transportation</h2><br />
<strong>Fenway Park:</strong> We took the train in from our hotel in Somerville, just 3.6 miles away. It took a little more than an hour to get to the gate. It&rsquo;s possible this was an isolated case, but the train stopped dozens of times inside the tunnel, presumably to accommodate other subway traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Wrigley:</strong> I&rsquo;ve never missed the stinky Red Line more. I&rsquo;ve made it from the end of the Blue Line at Forest Park to the Sheffield Red Line stop in less than an hour before. That&rsquo;s 13.7 miles.</p>
<p>All that said, Boston itself is on par with Chicago as far as great cities are concerned. And the people are friendly, despite the gruffness they are stereotyped to convey. If I had to become a Bostonite tomorrow, I&rsquo;d buy a condo in the North End in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d rather watch the game on TV.</p>
