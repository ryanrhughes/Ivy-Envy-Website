<p>The folks over at <a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a> have started a weekly bloggers rountable.&nbsp; It's a really cool idea and I'm honored that they asked me to participate.&nbsp; Definitely go over there and check it out.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/2009/03/waiw-cubs-blog-roundtable-inaugural.html">first edition</a> poses this question:<br />
<em>With Opening Day approaching, everyone in the Cubs blogosphere is making their predictions for 2009. A few are destined to be dead wrong. John thought LaTroy Hawkins was a great pickup in 2004. Steve once saw Hee Seop Choi as the future of 1<sup>st</sup> base for the Cubs. Who is the Cubs player you thought would be great, but ended up falling on his face? It doesn&rsquo;t have to be something you&rsquo;ve put on your blog &ndash; maybe you were so taken with Corey Patterson&rsquo;s return, you went out and bought his jersey in 2004. Maybe you believed Mark Prior as recently as his 7<sup>th</sup> comeback attempt. What&rsquo;s the biggest Cubs player whiff to which you&rsquo;ll admit?</em></p>
<p>Go on over and read my answer along with a handful of other Cubs bloggers.&nbsp; I'm interested in your answer for this question.&nbsp; Post your comments over there...and tell them that Ivy Envy sent you.</p>
