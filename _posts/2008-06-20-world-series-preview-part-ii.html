<p>Well, if the Cubs were to get to the World Series and face the Rays, let's hope the National League pulls through in the All-Star Game and gives the Cubs home field advantage.&nbsp; The Cubs have lots of travel and not very much rest<a id="more"></a><a id="more-100"></a>&nbsp;ahead of them and tomorrow's 1:20 start against the South Siders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Cubs are leaving Tampa bruised and battered.&nbsp; The injury bug has hit them bad in the last week, Alfonso Soriano, Carlos Zambrano, Reed Johnson and Jim Edmonds.</p>
<p>One bright spot:&nbsp; St. Louis struggled with the powerhouse of the American League...the Royals, and the boys in blue didn't lose any ground.&nbsp;</p>
