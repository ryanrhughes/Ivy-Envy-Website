<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the firing of Mike Quade and reflect on his short managerial career with the Cubs. &nbsp;We look at the highlights, lowlights and his future in baseball. &nbsp;We look at the options the Cubs have for a manager, one of which is not Ryne Sandberg. &nbsp;We consider what it would be like for Sandberg to be the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>We give an update on Ken, who is in Venezuela and will be keeping an eye (maybe) on Zambrano for us. &nbsp;We pick a winner for the photo caption contest and talk about Cubs Convention vs. Spring Training.</p>
