  content: Reed was a great pick-up for the Cubs.  I think if he had a little more
    power and he wasn't injured last year, he'd probably be playing on the Northside
    this year.

<p>We've known all along that getting Reed Johnson back this year would be a long shot.&nbsp; Once the Cubs signed <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1770" target="_blank">Cliffy Six Nad</a>, that chance faded away completely, yet I still kept my fingers crossed.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/01/dodgers-close-with-reed-johnson.html" target="_blank">MLBtraderumors.com</a> is currently reporting that Johnson is close to signing with the Dodgers.&nbsp; I'm not sure if the majority of the fan base will care very much, but personally, I am disappointed to see him go.&nbsp; Though his strippy hookbeard only annoyed me when the Cubs first acquired him in '08, he won me over eventually with copious amounts of hustle and hard play.&nbsp; I've always been an advocate for getting Johnson more playing time, but it just has never worked out that way with the Cubs.&nbsp; He did appear in 108 games for the Cubs in 2008, and he posted a .303 batting average in 274 plate appearances, and&nbsp;when he was with the Blue Jays, he showed signs that he could be a viable every day option for a team as well.&nbsp; I don't think that his injuries last year helped his case for staying with the Cubs either.</p>
<p>There will be several feats of Johnson that will stick with me always (sorry that sounds so filthy).&nbsp; He is responsible for one of the best catches I have ever seen/will ever see:</p>

<p>He also got the game-winning hit in the game I went to in '08.&nbsp; During his <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1123" target="_blank">rehab assignment I attended in Peoria</a>, Johnson's hustle was stunning.&nbsp; He almost had a foot on second base on both of the routine infield pop-ups he hit. &nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, who can forget Reed robbing Fielder of his first grand-slam?</p>

<p>Who will entertain us in the outfield the way Reed Johnson did?&nbsp; We might just have to settle for a few nice Fukudome and Fuld plays and a few bunny hops.</p>
<p>As far as the Nady signing is concerned, I remember thinking how stupid the Pirates were when they let him go.&nbsp; I have come to view that whole thing as the beginning of the Pirates' string of head-scratching trades.&nbsp; Of course then he proceeded to get injured.&nbsp; Nady is an awesome player <em>when he is healthy</em>.&nbsp; How often have we heard that refrain as Cubs fans?&nbsp; We will miss having Reed.</p>
