<p>A lot of Cubs fans have poo-poo'd the notion of the youth movement, but in the last two days, the youth has pulled through with late-inning heroics. &nbsp;In last night's game, Tony Campana doubled down the left-field line, advanced to 3rd on a sacrifice bunt by Fukudome and then scored on a Starlin Castro base-hit.</p></p>
<p>If you didn't see this game, I don't believe anyone else on the team could have stretched the hit into a double. &nbsp;To give you an idea of how "deep" the hit went, Ryan Braun had to contend with the bullpen pitcher's mound. &nbsp;This is precisely why I believe the Cubs need to keep Tony Campana up with the team. &nbsp;He brings a dimension to the team that we literally have not seen in years. &nbsp;This victory was purely generated by his speed. &nbsp;If he stays up, Tyler Colvin should stay in Iowa the rest of the year, unless he's batting .450 for the I-Cubs.</p></p>
<p>Don't get too excited about two wins in a row over the the first-place team in the division. &nbsp;One of the few bright spots on this 2011 team, Darwin Barney, is headed to the Disabled List after injuring his knee while scoring the game-winning run Monday night against the Brewers. &nbsp;Barney has quickly become my favorite player on the team to watch and now he'll be gone for two weeks.</p></p>
<p>Barney entered Spring Training as a player on the periphery. &nbsp;He worked hard and played well in Spring Training, earning a spot on the team. &nbsp;Just a few weeks later, he was rewarded with the starting job at 2nd base. &nbsp;He's been one of the most consistent and reliable players on the team. &nbsp;He's played in 63 games and has a .294 batting average. &nbsp;He's within one RBI and two runs scored of leading the team in those statistical categories. &nbsp;That runs scored number would probably be significantly higher if the heart of the batting order was able to drive in runs.</p></p>
<p>The good news is that Barney isn't seriously injured. &nbsp;It is a Grade 1 PCL strain in his right knee. &nbsp;Barney stated that he could be back within a week. &nbsp;However, this season is a loss, so they might as well let him recover fully, rather than have him deal with a nagging injury all year by trying to get him back as soon as possible.</p></p>
<p>Barney's injury will lead to more playing time for Jeff Baker and Blake Dewitt. &nbsp;Baker is returning from his time on the DL and has played really well this year. &nbsp;Dewitt has also been playing pretty well. &nbsp;If Jim Hendry isn't too scared to make some moves, this might be a good opportunity to showcase these guys and trade them while they're playing well.</p></p>
