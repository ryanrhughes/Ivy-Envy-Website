<p>The Chicago Cubs moved their Midwest League affiliate to South Bend from Kane County in this last off-season.  Chris talks about what attracted the Cubs to South Bend.  South Bend has done an excellent job with branding and their logos.  Chris explains the thought that went into some of this development.</p>
<p>Chris also describes some of the really creative things South Bend is doing with infographics to share in-game information with fans through their social channels.  </p>
<p>We also get into the 2015 South Bend Cubs.  Gleyber Torres is the highest ranked prospect with the Cubs here to start the season.  Chris also talks about the phenomenal start that Cael Brockmeyer has had with South Bend this season.  </p>
