  content: This is a tough one.  Grabow (although hard to believe) has a better curve
    ball.  But the tee ensures perfect "pitch" placement.   Grabow is an actual human
    being which is another advantage but the only problem is the human being he happens
    to be is John Grabow and that's very unfortunate.  The tee is made of polyethylene,
    which is recyclable, and you have to figure that you don't have to cut the tee
    a paycheck.

  content: I think I have to go with the pitcher full of sweet tea.  So sweaty and
    tasty.
