  content: "[&#8230;] In many ways a move in the next week or so was completely predictable.
    On the other hand, I think a promotion right now has the potential to lead to
    a sticky situation later this season. I don&#8217;t think the Cubs had any intention
    of calling up Kris Bryant to the big league team this season. I think they&#8217;d
    much prefer to wait until after the Super-Two Status cut-off next season. If you
    don&#8217;t understand what the Super-Two Status is or why the Cubs would benefit
    from waiting to call up Kris Bryant, or any other prospect after this cut-off,
    read the piece I wrote on Javier Baez and Super-Two Status. [&#8230;]"

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/BaezBomb.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9182" alt="BaezBomb" src="/uploads/2014/03/BaezBomb-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>After a Spring Training which provided a glimpse of the future of the Cubs, come Opening Day, fans will slump when they look at the starting line-up. Many fans are wondering why Javier Baez is not with the Cubs, but rather assigned to AAA Iowa. Baez certainly looked ready to stay with the big league club. In 42 plate appearances, Baez hit .310/.310/.738 with 5 HR. If you're reading this, you've probably watched or have seen the video of his Spring Training moon-shots. They have been impressive enough to cause us to watch them over and over and giggle like little school-girls.</p>
<p>So is Javier Baez headed to Iowa because he has improvements to make? Yeah, kind of. We've seen that pitchers, even MLB-caliber, will have a difficult time throwing a fastball past Baez. It's safe to assume that a 21-year old that has supernatural bat-speed and the power to bounce balls off Waveland roof-top buildings has holes in his swing and weaknesses that crafty MLB pitchers could take advantage of. If you look past the power he displayed this spring, Baez had 13 strikeouts and no walks. I look back on a game (I couldn't tell you which one) this spring where Baez came to the plate with the bases loaded and struck out, swinging at three straight pitches.</p>
<p>With an offense as anemic as the 2014 Cubs could potentially be, you might be thinking it'd be worth it to let Baez develop at the major league level. He'll never draw a lot of walks. He's ready to go. Let's see some balls fly out of Wrigley. Let's get the future started! Well, development isn't the only reason Baez is in Iowa. It's not even the #1 reason. Leaving Javier Baez in Iowa for the first part of the 2014 makes financial sense for the Chicago Cubs. The Cubs will keep Baez in Iowa long enough to avoid Super-Two Status.</p>
<p>In simple terms, if the Cubs had Javier Baez start with the major league team now, or before the Super Two deadline, he would become eligible for arbitration eligible after the 2015 season. If the Cubs call up Baez after this deadline, he will be be arbitration eligible after the 2016 season. Just that one-year delay and the 3 years of arbitration eligibility vs. 4 years of arbitration eligibility can make a huge difference over the course of his contract. &nbsp;The savings is difficult to calculate, but could easily be more than $10 million if Javier performs as expected.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball players are eligible for arbitration after three years of MLB service time. Prior to being arbitration eligible, the organization is able to set the salary for the player. Once a player is arbitration eligible, the player may negotiate with the organization to set the salary. Becoming arbitration eligible obviously means a significant jump in salary.</p>
<p>This is where Super Two Status comes into play. Super Two Status is a fairly confusing topic for the layperson (like myself). Players that have between two and three years of MLB service time and are in the top 22% of all 2-year players as far as service time goes, are arbitration eligible and treated as though they have 3 years of service time.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider in this Javier Baez situation is that players are eligible to become free agents after six years of being on the 40-man roster. If the Cubs brought up Javier Baez to start the 2014 season, he would become a free agent after the 2019 season. By waiting until the Super Two Status deadline passes, Baez would become free agency eligible after the 2020 season. If you're looking at the 2017-2020 window like the Cubs front office probably is, you can understand why the Cubs wouldn't want Baez to explore his free agency options a year early.</p>
<p>So what's the magical Super Two Status date? Well, that all depends. Because the formula includes percentages of players and their service time, it is not known until after the season is completed. In 2012, the percentage raised from 17% to 22%, so we only have a few years to go on with the new level. In 2012, the cut-off was 2 years, 139 days. In 2013, the cut-off was significantly shorter at 2 years, 122 days. The Super Two date will probably be sometime in June. I would expect the Cubs to play it safe with calling up Baez and avoiding the Super Two Status deadline. In fact, I would not be surprised if they wait until after the All-Star Break, July 14<sup>th</sup>-17<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>If the Cubs decide to offer Javier Baez a long-term deal, all of this discussion goes away. That's what the Cubs did with Starlin Castro. There are advantages to locking players up early, like Castro and Rizzo, because the organization can potentially get a better deal by offering players stability and a larger sum of money up front, avoiding the first two or three years of (relatively) low salary.</p>
<p>While Cubs fans would like to see the added excitement of Javier Baez up with the Cubs to start the 2014 season, it was just never going to happen. So we will hope for continued development and no injuries before Baez gets that call.</p>
