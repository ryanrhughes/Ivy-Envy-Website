  content: The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International (JDRF) is the leading
    charitable funder and advocate of type 1 (juvenile) diabetes research worldwide.
    The mission of JDRF is to find a cure for diabetes and its complications through
    the support of research. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that strikes
    children and adults suddenly, and can be fatal. Until a cure is found, people
    with type 1 diabetes have to test their blood sugar and give themselves multiple
    insulin injections or use a pump &mdash; every day of their lives. And even with
    that intensive care, insulin is not a cure for diabetes, nor does it prevent its
    eventual and devastating complications, which may include kidney failure, blindness,
    heart disease, stroke, and amputation.
