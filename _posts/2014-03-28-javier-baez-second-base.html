  content: Thanks, Michael Cotton.  I just assume if people like it, they'll share.  Hard
    to tactfully ask for shares.

  content: Javier Baez should play 3rd base our outfield, he has pretty bad range.
    Last season he had 44 errors at short, that's not a road the Cubs need to go down
    again. He has a good arm so 3rd would work with his limited range.

  content: I like Baez at second. That way if Castro has another bad year you trade
    him off and plug in Alcantara in his spot who is a speedy switch hitter.

<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Baez-Fielding.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9236" alt="Baez-Fielding" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Baez-Fielding-300x223.jpeg" width="300" height="223" /></a>Once the Cubs officially cut Javier Baez and sent him to the minor league camp, the <strong>Javy Baez Watch</strong> began. Barring serious injury with Iowa or major delays in development, we should see Baez with the Cubs in 2014. The question is, when the Cubs decide it's time to breathe new life into Cubs fans and call on Baez, where will he play in the field?</p>
<p>A year ago, we thought Castro would be moved to 3<sup>rd</sup> base and hand the shortstop position over to Baez. Or perhaps Baez would occupy the hot corner. That was before the Cubs signed Kris Bryant in the 2013 draft and then <del datetime="2014-03-27T23:43:30+00:00">acquired</del> stole Mike Olt in the Matt Garza trade. So a move to 3<sup>rd</sup> base would mean the transpiring of events we don't want to even think about.</p>
<p>All signs indicate that either Castro or Baez will shift over to 2<sup>nd</sup> base. Castro, the 24-year-old "veteran" <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/cubs/cubs-starlin-castro-open-position-switch-javier-baez" target="_blank">voiced his opinions</a> on a potential position change.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Yes, whatever it takes. If I need to move positions, I'm OK with that. If he is on our team and him being there helps the team win, then I am fine with that. I just want our team to win. That's it."</blockquote><br />
So if we are to believe that quotation, and I see no reason not to, Castro is OK with changing positions. Like any minor league prospect, I'm guessing Javier Baez will be thrilled to play any position the Cubs offer in the big leagues. Baez got a few games at 2<sup>nd</sup> base this spring. The move from shortstop to 2<sup>nd</sup> is a fairly easy one, even though Baez had not played the position since his freshman year in high school. On this topic, <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/cubs-top-prospect-javier-baez-eases-over-to-second-base?ymd=20140317&amp;content_id=69503548&amp;vkey=news_mlb" target="_blank">Starlin Castro said</a>, "When you're a shortstop, you can play any position in the infield."</p>
<p>At this point, I like the idea of Baez playing 2<sup>nd</sup> base when he arrives with the Cubs. Neither Castro nor Baez will be gold glove winners at any position. We have become well aware of Castro's shortcomings in the field. We've seen the errors and the lack of attention. In his first four seasons, Castro has had 29, 27, 27, and 22 errors. In 2014, we saw career lows in both fielding and throwing errors. His fielding percentage has improved from .950 in 2010 to .967 in 2014.</p>
<p>I bring up Castro's poor defense to say that I think he's getting better. When Castro was called up to the big leagues at the age of 20, Castro had 55 games of experience at shortstop above the Single-A level and exactly zero games at the AAA level. Castro had some learning to do, and perhaps that's what we saw his first few seasons - development that probably should have happened in Tennessee and Iowa.</p>
<p>So, as Cubs fans, we've been through four seasons of a learning curve with a young, inexperienced, and shaky shortstop. I don't really care to go through another three seasons of a player settling into the shortstop position. Baez is getting that development time in the minors. He has played all 203 of his minor league games at shortstop. But he's still young, 21 years-old, and if Castro's 29 error (.950) season was tough to stomach, in 2013, Baez committed 44 errors and had a .932 fielding percentage between Daytona and Tennessee. Baez's name is known because of his bat, not his glove.</p>
<p>Besides the numbers, just based on what I've seen from the two players, to me Castro seems more like a shortstop. He appears to be more fluid and have better range. He seems quicker than Baez, both on his feet and with his arm. I also think that Castro has more of a shortstop-type body. Jason Parks from Baseball Prospectus has compared Baez to Miguel Cabrera and Kurt mentioned that in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/gotta-move-chickens-podcast-episode-6-06/" target="_blank">this week's episode of our podcast</a>. Being the power-hitter he is, I would expect Baez to continue to bulk up.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I'd like to see Castro stay at shortstop and Baez take over at 2<sup>nd</sup> base. The future of the Cubs is a fluid situation, and things can and will change. Like I said, less than a year ago, we assumed either Castro or Baez would slide over to 3<sup>rd</sup> and Alcantara perhaps would take over at 2<sup>nd</sup> base. Third base is doing just fine right now, and as for Alcantara, that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that if the infield at the end of the season is Olt, Castro, Baez and Rizzo, that's potentially enough offensive firepower to not be too concerned with which middle infielder is where.</p>
