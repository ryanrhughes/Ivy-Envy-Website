<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7.33.jpg"><img data-id="11307"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7.33-300x300.jpg" alt="7.33" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11307" /></a>On this week's episode, we discuss our joy that the Cubs' 5-game losing streak is over, but we don't believe one win (by a 1-0 score) is enough to convince us the Cubs have turned the corner and have worked past the issues that led to a 5-game losing streak.  </p>
<p>Although Kurt's not on the episode, we share some scary stats, several bad scary stats and we actually have a couple of good scary stats from the bullpen to share.  </p>
<p>Jorge Soler is rehabbing in Iowa and although (in two games) he hasn't lit the world on fire offensively, his production at the plate is probably not the most important thing to pay attention to.  After recovering from an ankle issue, the important thing is his physical confidence.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow starts the International Free Agency signing period.  We talk about the Cubs recent history with these signings and we talk about what they might do this season.  </p>
