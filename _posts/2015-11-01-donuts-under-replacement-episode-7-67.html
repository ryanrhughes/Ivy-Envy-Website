<p>Theo Epstein held a press conference one day after the Cubs season ended.  We talk about the topics Theo covered in in the press conference.  </p>
<p>Typically, in October and November, we spend a lot of time talking about the Cubs prospects participating in the Arizona Fall League.  Obviously, we had much better things to talk about...the Cubs post-season run.  We go over the Cubs prospects in the Arizona Fall League this season and talk about their production and development.  </p>
<p>Since this is the first post-season episode, we share the important MLB post-season dates and discuss how those dates will impact the Cubs.  </p>
