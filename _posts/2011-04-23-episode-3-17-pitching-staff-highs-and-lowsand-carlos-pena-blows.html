<p>Andy, Kurt and Corey talk about the good (Zambrano) and bad (Russell/Coleman) of the pitching staff in the last week. &nbsp;Kurt's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scary Stat of the Week</span> turns into a barrage of scary stats about Carlos Pena. &nbsp;We welcome Dodgers fan, Brett Daniel, back to the podcast to talk about the off-the-field chaos that has plagued the Dodgers this year. &nbsp;Then, at the end of the show, we read your entries from the Photo Caption Contest and pick a unanimous winner.</p>
