  content: "In 2004, after just one year of interest in baseball in my late-30's,
    I decided to visit the USA specifically to watch the Cubs at Wrigley Field. I
    experienced October baseball in Chicago that year, albeit a regular season game.
    It was on my friend's birthday, and through a friend-of-a-friend, his girlfriend
    and I managed to get his birthday acknowledged on the matrix screen. Up it popped
    \"JB - 45\". Both his girlfriend and I spotted it, but in the confusion of us
    nudging him, he missed it himself.\nThe Cubs lost that day. But we witnesses Sammy's
    last home run (and game) for the Cubs. \nI've now seen 14 games at Wrigley Field,
    plus one rooftop, and two stadium tours - I'll be back there again sometime..."

  content: "I went to Wrigley for the first time last summer. Actually, we went to
    all of the Cubs MiLB affiliates. \nOur seats were right under the press box. When
    I walked out and saw the field for the first time, it was a magical moment. I
    was glad to share it with my wife and kids, but at that moment, it was just me
    and Wrigley. \nThe 7th inning stretch was fun. Edwin Jackson handed the Pirates
    a loss. Singing Go Cubs Go on a sunny Sunday at Wrigley was amazing.  \nI bought
    the first base bag from the Cubs Authentics booth before the game. I was starting
    to get antsy around the 9th inning, but they finally brought it to me."

  content: Oh man, so many great memories at Wrigley. The 8 run comeback vs the Rockies
    in '08. Sammy Sosa tying Ernie Banks with 512 HRs as a Cub. I missed catching
    that ball by a foot. The guy right behind me got it. Taking my boys to the field.
    They've both been to multiple games despite being only 8 and 6 and living in Colorado.
    My wife and I having our first official date at Wrigley Field in 2001. My entire
    bachelor party being kicked out in the 8th inning and watching the Cubs come back
    to beat the Cards in the 9th over at Murphy's Bleachers. Schierholtz tossing my
    son a ball last summer. And more, but that's just what comes to mind right off
    the bat. I love the old park and the Cubs. Most things in life can't live up to
    the first amazing time, but seeing the Cubs at Wrigley Field never fails to live
    up to my dreams and memories.

Today, the Cubs will open up the 2014 season. We are under three weeks away from the 100th birthday of Wrigley Field. We decided that would be a good reason for us to share with you our best Wrigley Field memories. We would like to hear your favorite memories of Wrigley Field.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corey Fineran</span></strong><br />
It was August 8th, 1990, two years to the day after the first scheduled night game at Wrigley, and a few weeks before I started 8th grade. My maternal grandfather is the reason I am a Cubs fan. He passed away when I was seven years-old, before we had the chance to go to a game together. For my 13th birthday, my grandmother took me on a chartered bus trip from Canton, IL to Wrigley Field, for my first visit.</p>
<p>The bus trip was a little different than the bus trips Ivy Envy has put together, mainly because the average age was about 50 years higher. It was a sunny August day, I got to wear my new LA Gears I was supposed to save for the start of the school year and my Cubs were taking on the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>Mike Harkey took the mound for Don Zimmer's Cubs. <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN199008080.shtml" target="_blank">The game went 15 innings</a>, so I got to hear Harry belt out the 7<sup>th</sup> inning stretch twice. I saw four Hall of Famers: Ryne Sandberg, Andre Dawson, Ozzie Smith, Whitey Herzog (five if Lee Smith gets in). In the bottom of the 15<sup>th</sup>, Andre Dawson came to the plate with the bases loaded and singled in the winning run after 4 hours and 52 minutes of baseball.</p>
<p>The game was pretty exciting, especially for a 12 year-old experiencing his first game at Wrigley. It was such an exciting game that Chris Jaffe of The Hardball Times <a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/random-great-game-cubs-cardinals-august-8-1990/" target="_blank">wrote a piece on the game</a>.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of going on three more bus trips to Cubs games with my grandmother before she passed away last February. &nbsp;Although the attendees of the Ivy Envy bus trips were younger than the bus trips she was used to, she assured me that everyone should feel comfortable with her there. &nbsp;She said, "I'll get crooked with you."</p>

One time in spring, Beth and I were driving the three hours to Wrigley, and there were sheets of rain the entire way there. It was the kind of effect you're probably going to see if you go see that movie Noah. We figured it was going to be rained out for sure, but we headed to the ballpark anyway. When we got there, it was around 40 degrees, and on the way into the game, I stepped in a deep puddle--like the kind Bill Murray steps in in Groundhog Day ("Watch that first step--it's a dooozy!). I ended up having to buy Cubs socks at the gear shop for $2000 just to have some semblance of warmth, and it's a good thing I did because they ended up getting the game in.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Kurt Tucker</span></strong><br />
<em>The Sandberg Game (Not the one you're thinking of)</em><br />
I had the pleasure of attending the August 28, 2005 game when Ryne Sandberg's #23 was retired. I've talked about how I am a latecomer to the Cubs. Many Cubs fans are born into it. I was adopted after a childhood of jumping around from team to team with no real passion for any of them. I got my baseball fix from trading cards, Saturday GOTW (we didn't get WGN), TWIB, and chatting with friends after little league practice. I can't claim to be the world's biggest Ryno fan, but he was on the short list of cards I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>
<p>It was just a month after his "Respect the game" speech at his hall of fame induction, which really hit home for me. I can be overly nostalgic about baseball. I felt like an old man and a kid all at the same time. Nodding my head while one of the greatest tells "the kids" to "respect the game" and at the same time seeing the 20 something baseball card version of him that was burned in to my memory.</p>
<p>We got to our seats just in time to see him share a few words with Ernie, Billy and Ron seated nearby. After he spoke he walked around the entire field holding his wife's hand waving to every fan.</p>
<p>After that the Cubs crushed the Marlins 14-3. Zambrano beat Beckett, but that wasn't the best part of being there that day. In more than 100 years of Cubs baseball, #23 was just the fourth number to be added to the foul poles. It was an unforgettable experience to be there for one of them.</p>

Nervous excitement vibrated through my 7-year-old body as I held my dad&rsquo;s hand on our walk toward the stadium. My surroundings were familiar, but in a dulled dreamlike way. It was the first time I&rsquo;d ever been to a place I&rsquo;d seen on TV.</p>
<p>It was a hot, 90-degree day in June. The Cubs were playing the Pirates that day. My two brothers walked ahead of us with my grandfather in the lead. He&rsquo;d been here many times in his life, once for a tryout. But World War II called first. He smiled back to us, thrilled to be bringing his grandsons to the park for their first time.</p>
<p>As we walked up the steps, escaping the relative darkness of the stadium concourse, the saturated greenness of the ivy-clad outfield wall hit my pupils first. My next inhalation caught in my chest and it took me a second to grab it.</p>
<p>I will never forget the day I lost my breath at Wrigley Field.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Doug Green</span></strong><br />
I have been a Cubs fan for as long as I can remember, but I've only ever made one trip to Wrigley. The date was May 26, 2006. I was excited, it was ticketed as a great pitching matchup as Carlos Zambrano squared off against Tim Hudson of Atlanta. Ron Santo was scheduled to be the 7<sup>th</sup> inning stretch singer and the sun poured over the most perfect grass I had ever seen in my life.</p>
<p>It turned out that Zambrano was on that day. He carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning, despite giving up a first inning run without a hit. I was trying to explain what was going on to my wife, who is not a baseball fan, without breaking the tradition of talking about a no-hitter that's in progress. The whole time, I'm thinking to myself "Holy #*&amp;@(, I'm going to see a no-hitter on my first pull! This is awesome!"</p>
<p>Awesome did not last though as Zambrano lost the no-hit bid in the seventh, and my arch nemesis Neifi Perez, committed an error (He dropped the friggin' relay throw!) that allowed the winning run to score as the Cubs lost 6-5. Still, I remember the day fondly. I got a hot dog, saw a Cubs homer by Freddie Bynum (WHO?) and can die a happy man.</p>

My favorite visit to Wrigley had to be be from last year. I went to the August 4<sup>th</sup> game, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The entire visit had been spontaneous. I was only in Chicago because of Lollapalooza. I woke up on that Sunday and decided that I would &ldquo;treat&rdquo; my twin brother and sister to a Sunday Cubs game, as a birthday gift. With mighty hangovers, we ended up at Wrigley field. We got off the train and the weather was just beautiful.</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wrigley-field-aug-4-CR.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-9512" alt="Wrigley field aug 4 CR" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Wrigley-field-aug-4-CR-1024x768.jpg" width="512" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>Because it was last minute, I went to get the tickets while my siblings enjoyed the bass band. After that, we made our way to our seats. This was the first time I had ever attended a game in the outfield bleachers. We managed to secure a good location and then went and got a few liquid libations. Once settled in, my siblings and myself tried to figure out who was actually playing that game. It was early August after all. We got to see Donnie Murphy pop out the only time the Cubs threatened and Junior Lake ordered to proper locations by <del datetime="2014-04-03T03:03:15+00:00">Kim</del> David DeJesus.</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9519" alt="1" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/1-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>Now what made this my favorite experience was the the fact that this was the first time that I had went to a Cubs games as an &ldquo;adult&rdquo; and with only my siblings. I'm not sure if it was the heat and alcohol, but after several uninteresting innings, I became reflective on the day's events. I believe that most baseball fans are really children at heart and this made me think of all the things we did as children. The games of hide and go seek, flipping out when someone cheated at Monopoly, or laying in front of the TV watching the Cubs blow it. This afternoon brought me back to those carefree days with my siblings.</p>
<p>I am still <em>several</em> years (cough) away from hitting the big 3-0, but I realized at the time that spending time, like this with my siblings, is finite. Careers, spouses, and life will conspire against spontaneous trips like this. Until that happens, I'll enjoy the day's memory of meeting the only obnoxious Canadian (like ever) and seeing my sister's horror as &ldquo;she&rdquo; accidentally kicked/dropped nachos on someone's head. (It was unintentionally me! Muhahaha)</p>

Here is a brief history of my experiences at Wrigley Field and I had to do some digging for the exact numbers and such on the internet. I did not remember all of these off of the top of my head for those people wondering. And, as always, photo credit to my mom on the two pictures.<br />
<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/014-8.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9584" alt="014 (8)" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/014-8-177x300.jpg" width="177" height="300" /></a><br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Games I've seen at Wrigley: 23</span></p>
<p>Cubs record in those games: 7-16 (Naturally...)</p>
<p>First game at Wrigley (7/5/01): A bright July day with the sun shining down. I went to the game with my mom, sister, and my grandmother. We sat five rows up from the Cubs dugout. Mark Grace was on the tickets and the Cubs were playing the Pirates. Scott Downs started for the Cubs and took the loss as the Cubs lost 9-6. Sammy Sosa, my favorite player back then, went 1-5 and Grace went 0-3 with a &nbsp;run scored. &nbsp;I don't remember much of the game. I have to rely on pictures that my mom has taken of that game. But I know that I fell in love for the first time in my life at seven years old, and I fell in love with the game and Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>My best experience at Wrigley, though, was not my first game. It was a crisp night in 2010, July 20th to be exact and the Cubs were playing the Astros. I caught a batting practice home run so that was a cool start to the night. The game, however, didn't start as I wanted. Ryan Dempster started for the Cubs and gave up seven runs in 5 innings as the Cubs were down 7-1 going into the bottom of the fifth. And then an offensive explosion. The Cubs scored five in the fifth, led by a Aramis Ramirez home run (his second in two innings). Then, during the seventh inning stretch, and after the Cubs tied the game in the sixth, I was on TV singing my heart out (the picture is when I was on TV, a live shot). The Cubs capped off the rally with two in the seventh then five more in the eight, finished by Aramis' third homer of the game that went right over my head in the first row of the bleachers in left center. The Cubs scored 13 unanswered runs and won 14-7. It was incredible.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">6/16/07 vs. Padres- Derrek Lee and Chris Young got in a fight, Carlos Zambrano took a no hitter into the eighth, and allowed two hits all game (one for a home run in the ninth) and the Cubs lose 1-0.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">10/2/08 vs. Dodgers (Game 2 NLDS)- A birthday present from my mom, we both went up to the game and sat in the bleachers. I caught a batting practice home run from Manny Ramirez, and he decided to hit two more during the game and the Cubs lost 10-3 on their way to getting swept for a second straight year. I was crushed.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">4/12/13 vs. Giants- Cubs lead 2-0 going into the ninth, naturally Kyuji Fujikawa blows the save and gives up three runs. 3-2 Giants and here comes Sergio Romo to close and Chorizo (AKA Dioner Navarro) hit a pinch hit home run to tie it, and Starlin Castro added a two out walk off double later in the ninth to score David DeJesus and the Cubs won 4-3.</p><br />
