<p>Let's hope that the tv-radio delay isn't that bad for TBS.&nbsp; I don't know about anyone else, but my delay varies from day to day and channel to channel.&nbsp; Now I haven't made it a secret that I don't particularly enjoy listening to Pat and Ron because Ron is hard for me to handle sometimes.&nbsp; However, anything would be better than the TBS announcers covering this series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TBS is sending Richard Stockton and Ron Darling.&nbsp; If you aren't familiar with Richard Stockton, <a id="more"></a><a id="more-244"></a>he's the announcer that covered the Cubs/Diamondbacks playoff series last year.&nbsp; These are a few of his highlights:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Calling Alfonso Soriano "Adolpho" and "Alonzo".</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Calling Aramis Ramirez "Rodrigo Ramirez".</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Calling Mike Quade "Mike Kwayde"</p>
<p>...And my personal favorite...</p>
<p>*&nbsp; He referred to the Cubs as "the Cowboys".</p>
<p>Perhaps it was difficult to take last year because there was absolutely no bright spot to the playoffs for the Cubs last year.&nbsp; Hopefully things go better this year and if the tv-radio delay is too painful, we can createthe Dick Stockton Drinking Game.&nbsp; I fully expect Stockton to win the Asshat of the Week award.</p>
