Jorge Soler was placed on the Disabled List and Mike Baxter was called back up to the Cubs.  Kris Bryant was named the NL Rookie of the Month for the month of May.  </p>
<p>We discuss Addison Russell's TOOTBLAN in the second game of the Cubs series with the Marlins.  It looked like the Cubs would have the bases loaded with 1 out in the 9th inning, but instead they had runners on 1st and 3rd with two outs and the game ended with a Miguel Montero strikeout.  That night, #wewerenotgood.</p>
<p>Javier Baez is playing some of his best baseball in the Cubs organization and with American League games coming up, it appears the timing may be right for Javy to make an appearance with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We got a few questions from listeners.  We'll talk about Starlin's slo-mo home run trot and again talk about all of the Castro-hate.  </p>
