<p>This morning, I wandered over to Cubs.com for the first time in months.  I am greeted with the headline "Soriano Assuming Leadership Role".  God help us.  The article talks about Soriano being past his prime (no kidding), but still being valuable to the team.  Apparently Soriano is a clutch hitter?  Here's the frightening thing - he actually is.</p>
<p>Let's just look at this season.  To me, Soriano felt like a non-issue.  He's hit 25 homeruns, which is pretty decent for Soriano, at this point in his career.  However, his batting average is at .244 and his OBP is at .288.  He's struck out 111 times while only drawing 26 walks.  </p>
<p>Here's the thing though.  If you look at the situational stats, Soriano has some glaring weaknesses.  However, in 2011, he's batting .355 with runners on 3rd and less than two outs.  He's batting .364 with the bases loaded. I'll tell you right now, those numbers are cherry-picked.  As I said, there are bad numbers in his situational stats, but those high numbers stood out and surprised me.</p>
<p>Back to Soriano being a leader of the team.  Other than his "clutch-ness", the article claims that Soriano does a good job of keeping the clubhouse "loose".  Yeah, that's what this team needs.  I think the ability to stay loose is important over a long, 162-game season.  I also think fundamentals is important over a long, 162-game season.  In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that I think fundamentals is more important.  Apparently we don't have that type of leader on this team.</p>
<p>So we have a bad baseball team.  A team that can't hit with runners in scoring position.  A team that can't play defense.  A team that can't hit the cut-off guy.  A team that can't sustain a decent winning streak.  A team that literally has no direction.  But we have an immensely over-paid veteran that can "keep things loose".  Spectacular.</p>
<p>I wonder why this article was written by Carrie Muskat.  She's probably exhausted every topic this season and figures "Hell, nobody's paying attention, I'll just write something about Soriano.  I might as well make this entertaining for myself.  How about an article on how Soriano is a leader on this team."  </p>
<p>Here's what I think the real motivation for this post is.  And before I make my claim, I honestly don't know the relationship between the MLB beat-reporters and the individual clubs.  But knowing how MLB is, I'm guessing it's a pretty cozy relationship.  </p>
<p>A lot of fans/media have been vocal in support of the idea of the Cubs eating all/nearly all of Soriano's contract and sending him on his merry way.  While Soriano is definitely not earning his $19 million per season, they're going to have to pay for him either way.  If the Cubs aren't going to compete next season, what's the point in paying for two left-fielders?  This article feels like a PR piece, trying to sell fans on the idea of Soriano being back next year.  </p>
<p>On a side-note, it's interesting to see this "leader" complaining about the manager and his spot in the batting order to the media this weekend.  It's actually pretty comical that he is complaining about his spot in the batting order with 4 games left in the season.  A leader, indeed.</p>
