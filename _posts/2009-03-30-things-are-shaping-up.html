<p>I can't express how pleased I am that I won't see Paul Bako wearing Cubby Blue this season.  I won't have to experience the pain of watching him walk to the plate as essentially a guaranteed out.  Forget Bartman and the team meltdown in 2003, I'll never forget that feeling everytime I saw Bako leave the on-deck circle.&nbsp; Do I need to say how much I wish the Cubs would have kept Henry Blanco?</p>
<p>I'm also feeling pretty good about Gregg wrapping up the closer spot.  I'm interested in seeing if he continues what he's done in Spring Training.  Marmol's spring has just been too unpredictable for my liking.  I know that closers are, by nature, wild beasts.  That said, I want the most stable and reliable closer on the staff and at this point, that's Kevin Gregg.  Marmol will get his chance.</p>
