<p>Andy and Corey go over some of the things we've put in the podcast feed over the last week (Midwest League Traveler interview, an interview with Tim Sheridan from Boys of Spring - The Movie and the audio from the press conference with Tom Ricketts in Peoria.</p>
<p>We talk more about our 100th episode celebration, which will be next Saturday evening at 7pm. Corey describes his experience at the Cubs game yesterday, and his seat next to the best fan at Wrigley.   </p>
<p>The Cubs have a winning streak and we ask ourselves what it really means.  We also give our opinions of the job performance by Tom Ricketts thus far.   Corey fills in for Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week, one directed at anyone getting excited about the Cubs' winning streak.  And last, we do the weekly  photo caption contest.</p>
