<p>As if this season hasn't been painful and discouraging enough for us Cubs fans, it's gotten a little bit worse.  The "silver lining" of an historically bad season is a higher draft pick.  Well, with the Cubs becoming the last team in baseball to win three games in a row and sweeping the Astros, they have dropped to the #3 pick slot.  </p>
<p>I am to the point where I don't want to see anything good come to this team for the rest of the season.  They have failed me all season long and on Sunday, it about made me sick to my stomach to see them hopping around and celebrating a walk-off win against the worst team in baseball.  A team 18 games under .500 in July should not celebrate anything.  </p>
<p>I don't mean to throw the young guys and the role players under the bus, but I can't help but to associate this team with the overpaid and underperforming veterans.  The players that are so awful that the Cubs would consider eating 3/4 of the remaining 54 million on a contract with three years left on it.  Or the players that would reject a trade heading into the July 31st trade deadline because they don't want to move their family from Chicago, even though the family goes back to the Dominican Republic in early August and the Cubs are on the road until August 5th.  </p>
<p>Yes, I'm punishing Darwin Barney because I don't want to see Soriano or Ramirez celebrate.  They are part of the reason that the Cubs have one of the highest payrolls in baseball, yet one of the worst records.  Kurt is usually the voice that rails about the payroll, but it is discouraging to see the Pirates in 1st place when the Cubs' payroll is 177% greater.  </p>
<p>So now this team will probably go on a little run.  We'll see some smiles and they'll talk about "getting on track".  We'll see the Cubs' position in the 2012 draft drop further.  Worse, we'll see Jim Hendry act like what he's put together is starting to work.  What we won't see is the Cubs make the moves necessary to turn this organization around.  </p>
<p>There's my negative outlook for the day.  I'll be more positive when the Cubs return to their losing ways.  </p>
