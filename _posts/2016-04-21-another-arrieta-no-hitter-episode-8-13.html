<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 391st episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  For the second time since August, we recorded an episode on the night of a Jake Arrieta no-hitter.  Jake does it again, this time against the Reds.  The Cubs destroyed the Reds in the first game of the series, 16-0.  </p>
<p>While we spend a good amount of time swooning over Jake and the offensive explosion, we also look back on the series win and talk about several on-the-field and off-the-field topics.  </p>
<p>We have a scary stat of the (mid)week and Andy shares another Rube Waddell story.  </p>
