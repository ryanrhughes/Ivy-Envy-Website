<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />On this, the 402<sup>nd</sup> of the Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the Cubs' series win over the Cardinals in St. Louis.  It was a weird series, considering the Cubs lost in walk-off fashion on Monday and then won a wacky and nail-biting game on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>In the episode, Corey talks about how the Cubs have been impressive, even while playing under .500 baseball over the last few series.  He also defends Jorge Soler again after some social media discussions.  Andy talks about pitching, both the good and the bad Cubs pitching in the series with the Cardinals.  </p>
<p>Kurt previews the Cubs upcoming series with the Phillies and Andy tells a couple of Rube Waddell stories.</p>
