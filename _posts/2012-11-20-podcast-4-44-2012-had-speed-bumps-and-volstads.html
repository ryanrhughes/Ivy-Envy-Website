<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the moves that the Cubs have made so far this off-season, some of which went down this evening.  Matt Garza is cleared to resume workouts and we contemplate if he or Samardzija is the #1 starter for the Cubs in 2013.  </p>
<p>We each have an entry for the <u>Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flex of the Week</u> and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
