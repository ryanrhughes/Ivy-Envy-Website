We start things off by talking about some of the events that led to a six-game winning streak.  Some are good baseball and some are flukey plays.  </p>
<p>We can't go an episode without drooling over Kris Bryant, so of course we do that.  The Cubs have made several roster moves recently, including sending Travis Wood to the bullpen.  We run through the significant moves.</p>
<p>We received several listener questions and we go through all of those.  Kurt gives us a (good) scary stat of the week and we read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
