    so that might have something to do with it.  I'll look into it.

<p>On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to participate in the first ever Cubs Bloggers Forum with Crane Kenney. On this week's episode, we talk about the event. We start off by commenting on the fact the Cubs held this event. The media landscape is changing and the Cubs fully understand the role bloggers, podcasters and other "alternative media" people fill. The beat reporters often inform us of news, but the conversation continues with us.<br />

<p>There were several business-related topics covered in the 70 minutes we had with Crane Kenney. On this episode of the podcast, we cover many of these topics. The Cubs told us that it's likely the bleacher renovations will not be completed for Opening Day (Night). There are a few reasons for this and we discuss those reasons. We talk about the triangle lot and how it will be used. Rooftops were discussed, from the last deal Kenney made with the rooftops to the Ricketts family potentially buying rooftops.</p>
<p>Media Rights were brought up. We talk about what may happen with the games that would have been (and still might be) broadcast on WGN America. We also share some encouraging news about streaming MLB content and the frustrating blackouts. We also share what Kenney described are three potiential options for the Cubs and media rights after 2020.</p>
<p>Kenny also addressed the idea of the Ricketts family being cheap and not spending money with the Cubs. He also shared his opinion of Theo, Jed and the rest of the baseball side of the front office.</p>
