<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss whether or not we will ever see Zambrano in a Cubs uniform again.  We look at the September call-ups and talk about the players that we might see and who we want to see up with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We go throughs some listener-suggested topics and consider the idea of Ozzie Guillen managing the Cubs.  Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a (first-time) winner for this week's photo caption contest.   </p>
