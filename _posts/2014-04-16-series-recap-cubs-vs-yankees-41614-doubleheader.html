<p><u><strong>Result</u></strong><br />
Wednesday Afternoon: Yankees 3 Cubs 0<br />
Wendesday Evening: Yankees 2 Cubs 0</p>
<p><strong>Cubs Record:</strong> 4-10</p>
<p><u><strong>The Good</u></strong><br />
The Cubs saw another good outing by <strong>Jason Hammel</strong>.  Unfortunately, 7 innings pitched, 5 hits and 3 runs wasn't good enough for the Cubs offense.  Hammel is a piece I'm sure the Cubs would like to flip this season and he's pitching well, early in the season.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Bad</u></strong><br />
Don't look now, but <strong>Emilio Bonifacio</strong> is 1 for his last 21.  He's still hitting .339.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Ugly</u></strong><br />
Well, offensively speaking...<strong>pretty much everything</strong>.  Even if it was a two-game series, 0 runs in a series is rough.  At the end of the game, Len Kasper said that today was the first time the Cubs have been <strong>shut out in a day-night doubleheader</strong> since 1962.  Also, the <strong>Cubs have never won at Yankee Stadium</strong>, old or new.  </p>
