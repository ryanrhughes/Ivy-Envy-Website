  <p style="text-align:center;"><em>Mike Fontenot, Cubs role-player extraordinaire and Owen Wilson stunt double.</em></p>

  Sure sweeping the Pirates is nice, but playing well against a team like the Phillies is even better.&nbsp; Thursday's game was one of the most exciting I've seen all season, and there have been quite a few exciting games.&nbsp; Yes, Ramirez was the big hero of the game, but Mike Fontenot deserves some credit.

  content: totally agree, mallorey... that drives me crazy when they hit all the way
    through the order in an inning, and lou pinch hits for fontenot (i think that
    has happened twice).  he would indeed be a great every day player.

  content: Oh my gosh! I could not agree with you more. I am always saying to my friends
    and family that he does not in any way get enough credit for all he does! He comes
    off the bench and constantly delivers clutch hits and great defense! Also I think
    Lou should give him more playing time and stop taking him out right after he hits
    a great home run no matter who is pitching!!

<p>Sure sweeping the Pirates is nice, but playing well against a team like the Phillies is even better.&nbsp; Thursday's game was one of the most exciting I've seen all season, and there have been quite a few exciting games.&nbsp; Yes, Ramirez was the big hero of the game, but Mike Fontenot deserves some credit.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-206"></a></p>
<p>Fontenot hit the big homer that I believe jump-started the gelid Cubs offense.&nbsp; Sure, Hamels leaving the game was also a big factor, but Fontenot was the spark that ignited the Cubs rally.&nbsp; It makes the rest of them look bad when a guy who is a foot shorter than most of the team comes off the bench and buries one in the centerfield bleachers.</p>
<p>I like the Cubs' chances of sweeping the Phils with Lilly going today (he recently turned down a major political opportunity) and Zambrano on Sunday.&nbsp; A postseason without Boston and NYY?&nbsp; Awesome.&nbsp; It will be great to see some different teams in there for a change.</p>
