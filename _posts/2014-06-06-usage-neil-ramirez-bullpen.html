  content: Also, yes avoiding burning these young guys out ala Russell would be good.
    &nbsp;It'd be nice to have them around and effective for a number of years.

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been following the Cubs too closely this season, no one blames you.&nbsp; However, you have been missing out on a few positive trends.&nbsp; The Cubs bullpen is one aspect of this oddly cobbled group that has come together pretty nicely (minus the Veras boil that was just&nbsp;lanced); as a unit, the relievers rank ninth in the majors in ERA with 3.13. &nbsp;Even for fans who watch regularly,&nbsp;they&rsquo;ve been easy to miss.&nbsp; They rank 20th&nbsp;in the majors in innings pitched at 178.1 (thanks to the starting rotation), and part of the Cubs organizational plan has been to keep a short bench as far as position players go in order to have thirteen in the bullpen (instead of the typical twelve).&nbsp; In <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/27835570-419/cubs-gm-jed-hoyer-remains-bullish-on-manager-rick-renteria.html#.U42yB5RdVdI">a recent Sun-Times article</a>, Gordon Wittenmeyer quoted Jed Hoyer on this plan: &ldquo;Given the experience some of these guys have in the bullpen, we&rsquo;re trying to actively make sure we don&rsquo;t overuse these guys . . . which results in a 13-man bullpen, which results in a shorter bench.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Cubs are trying to protect their young arms at the expense of limiting Renteria&rsquo;s pinch-hitting and substitution options in the later innings, and I like it.&nbsp; There was no way the Cubs could come close to having the young talent all arrive at once.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t want players like Neil Ramirez and Justin Grimm just sitting around, but they also want to avoid dropping a Russellian workload on them before the hitting arrives.</p>
<p>Speaking of Neil Ramirez&mdash;the guy is a great talent.&nbsp; He was drafted by the Rangers as the 44<sup>th</sup> pick in the 2007 draft.&nbsp; He has a starter&rsquo;s repertoire of pitches (he was a starting pitcher in the Rangers minor-league organization): fastball, slider, curve, and changeup. &nbsp;In fact, his array of pitches reminds me of Jake Arrieta. &nbsp;If you need an indication of how lively his fastball can be, check out this video of his first MLB strikeout:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I can't tell if Braun's lemur eyes&nbsp;are&nbsp;a reaction to the steal or the strikeout pitch, but I like to think it's the pitch.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">His other pitches seem to be developing pretty nicely after having some control issues in the past. &nbsp;He didn't even throw a slider until he was a part of&nbsp;the Rangers system. &nbsp;Neil has great numbers so far, and that success is due to his ability to keep hitters off-balance . &nbsp;He has a 0.68 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and only 4 walks. &nbsp;Now, here's the thing. &nbsp;This all only in 13.1 innings pitched, but that's what I'm talking about. &nbsp;Ramirez&nbsp;just turned 25 and won't be arbitration eligible until 2017, so it is smart of the Cubs to protect an asset like him.</p></p>
