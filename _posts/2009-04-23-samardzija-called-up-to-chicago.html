  content: I'm glad to see Samard-zija come up and I think he's here to stay. He'll
    be a good long relief guy if a starter ends up getting lit up. Kind of what they
    tried with Lieber last year. As for Vizcaino, he's had limited action, but according
    to Bob Brenly in today's pre-game he got his numbers "with mirrors" and "his stuff
    wasn't great". I think Cotts is running out of chances. If he pisses Lou off too
    many more times he's out.

<p>Jeff Samardzija will pass through my hometown as he heads on I-80 from Des Moines to Wrigley Field.&nbsp; As a huge Notre Dame fan, I'm pretty excited to see Samardzija get called up again.&nbsp; He was a pleasant and somewhat unexpected surprise last year as he played the role of one of those guys that seems to put up better numbers each time he moves up.&nbsp; He pitched in 26 games last year and posted a 2.28 ERA with the Cubs.</p>
<p>I was glad to see Samardzija optioned to Iowa to start the season.&nbsp; I think he'd make a great starter.&nbsp; In his short stint in Iowa last year as a starter, he went 4-1 in 6 games.&nbsp; He does need to develop that third pitch, however.&nbsp; But the Cubs bullpen scares me right now and I think it's a good idea to bring him in.&nbsp; I have no reason to believe this, but I think it might excite the bullpen a little.&nbsp; If nothing else, it might show then that Lou and the Cubs aren't afraid to make some tough or unexpected moves to keep this club winning games.</p>
<p>Vizcaino is apparently out.&nbsp; I'm guessing Cotts is breathing a little easier today knowing that he is staying...for now.&nbsp; If there is a member of that bullpen that has not performed, it's Cotts.&nbsp; I would say the general consensus is that Cotts' saving grace was the fact he's the only guy in the bullpen that can throw with his left arm.&nbsp; Although, I'd be willing to bet that Marmol could throw more strikes with his left arm than Cotts has been lately.<br />
So what do you think?&nbsp; Do you think Vizcaino is the right guy to send packing?&nbsp;&nbsp; He's only given up 2 hits in nearly 4 innings.&nbsp; The bigger question, do you think the bullpen settles down enough for Samardzija to go back to Iowa or is he here for the duration?&nbsp; I don't remember exactly, but I don't think it was expected that Samardzija would finish out the season last year.&nbsp; I seem to remember it originally being a temporary thing and he ended up pitching in 26 games.</p>
<p>Chime in with your opinions on this move.</p>
