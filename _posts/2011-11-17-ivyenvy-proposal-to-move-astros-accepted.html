<p>In our NL Central preview episode <a title="Podcast Episode 3.03" href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4014" target="_blank">3.03</a>, (29 minute mark) we proposed to James Yasko of <a title="Astros County" href="http://www.astroscounty.com/" target="_blank">Astros County</a> that the Astros do us a favor and take their balls to the AL West. Jeremy <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6378" target="_blank">posted</a> Wednesday about the potential realignment and the addition of two wild card teams. Bud Selig, who we're certain tunes in to the podcast, must have liked our proposal and decided to include it as a condition of sale of the Astros from Drayton McLane to Jim Crane. A condition worth a $65 million discount. Baseball and its owners unanimously approved the sale on Thursday. The Astros will join the AL West beginning in 2013 leaving us just one more year to watch six teams battle for that NL Central crown and one year closer to a statistically <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=849" target="_blank">even playing field</a> for the Cubs.</p>
