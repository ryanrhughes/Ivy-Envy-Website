  content: "I came off sounding a little bit silly and uniformed around the 11:30
    - 12:20 part of this broadcast.  The point I was trying to make is the way the
    rules are drawn up (mostly because of the way the players union drafts them) even
    the MLB statutes allow the players complete control after a certain point.  And
    it doesn't allow Selig to make exceptions for certain problem players.  \r\n\r\nFor
    example this same rule would allow a player like AJ Pierczinski from the White
    Sox to have a bad year, to throw a huge fit, act a fool by doing something to
    offend the fans.  Then he'd have the opportunity to deny a trade.  \r\n\r\nI'm
    not saying AJ would do that, but I'm using it as an example of the 10 year vet
    / 5 year tenure policy that allows a player to do that sort of thing.  \r\n\r\nNow,
    this rule is ASSUMING that there aren't going to be any disgruntled veterans who
    become angry down the road.  It's assuming all of these players are going to be
    poster boys for the nutcase community, much like a Milton Bradley or a Manny Ramirez,
    who MLB knows will be shipped around before they would be eligible to deny a trade.\r\n\r\nI'm
    glad I don't have to write that legislation.  Those sessions must be awfully sloppy.

<p>Andy, Corey and Ryan share their thoughts on the Ted Lilly/Ryan Theriot trade.  We also discuss Derrek Lee's decision to reject trades and whether Cubs fans should be frustrated with him for this.  Matt from <a href="http://www.wrigleybound.com" target="_blank">WrigleyBound</a> comes on to look at the minor league players the Cubs received in the Lilly trade.  And Ryan awards the Asshat of the Week.</p>
