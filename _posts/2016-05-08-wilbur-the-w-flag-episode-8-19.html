<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 397<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  In the last week, the Cubs went 7-0, sweeping two of the top teams in the National League, the Pirates and the Nationals.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we focus on the Nationals series.  We start things off by talking about where our heads are and trying to wrap our minds around this 2016 Cubs team.  Should we shed the "cautious" in "cautiously optimistic"?  </p>
<p>We look at some of the individual performances that fueled this Cubs this week and have flown under the radar this season. Although the Cubs are 24-6, we do have some negatives to talk about.  Heyward continues his slow start, although there are lots of positives with Heyward in the lineup.  We also talk about Travis Wood and his somewhat shaky performances.  </p>
<p>We check in on Albert Almora and Willson Contreras, who are both with Iowa and could join the Cubs this season.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener questions, share some scary stats and read an internet muscle flex.  </p>
