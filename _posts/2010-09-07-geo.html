<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Geo-001.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3237" title="Geo 001" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Geo-001-767x1024.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="491" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For those of you who missed Monday's game with the Astros (and I'm sure many of us did), Geovany Soto had a great game.&nbsp; Not only did he hit a go-ahead solo homer in the eighth inning, but in the fourth inning he also hung onto the ball after surviving a harsh collision with Michael Bourn at the plate.&nbsp; If you haven't seen this video, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=11777043&amp;topic_id=8878834&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">click here to watch it</a>.&nbsp; It looks like Soto gets hit in the face by Bourn's elbow, but as they fall to the ground, Bourn's face also appears to get raked by Soto's cleats.&nbsp; It was a pretty clean, hard-nosed play, and hats off to Soto for hanging on to that ball, especially since he got hammered only a split second after catching it.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">While I'm at it, hats off to Geovany Soto for a good season.&nbsp; He has played almost the same number of games as he played in '09 (97 to 102), and his numbers this year are much better than they were in '09.&nbsp; Here are some numbers to look at--</p></p>
<ul>
<li>2008--141 games/141 hits/23 HR/86 RBI/.285 BA/.364 OBP/.504 SLG</li>
<li>2009--102 games/72 hits/11 HR/47 RBI/.218 BA/.321 OBP/.381 SLG</li>
<li>2010--97&nbsp; games/83 hits/17 HR/51 RBI/.284 BA/.399 OBP/.521 SLG</li><br />
</ul><br />
With 24 games left to play, it looks to me like Soto is going to get fairly close to some of his numbers from 2008, and as you know, in 2008, Soto won the Rookie of the Year Award and played in the All-Star Game.&nbsp; Check out Soto's OBP and SLG percentages this year--pretty out of hand.&nbsp; Despite the Cubs playing terribly overall this season, Soto has quietly managed to have a great year.&nbsp; He is eligible for arbitration coming up in 2011, so the Cubs will have to pay him a little more than the $575,000 he is making this year.&nbsp; I hope they plan to keep him around for a while.</p>
