<p>Well, we thought we were just getting Theo, and now we have Jed Hoyer and Jason McLeod&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; The Cubs decided not to just hire a new GM.&nbsp; They decided to revamp the infrastructure with a group of proven winners.&nbsp; Hoyer is now the GM, and McLeod will&nbsp;head up&nbsp;scouting and player development.&nbsp; &nbsp;And now we fans have the immense pleasure of sitting back and either watching the magic happen or the plane crashing into the mountain.&nbsp; Most fans seem to think that it will be the former.&nbsp; I agree, but I hope people are willing to accept that it possibly isn't going to be microwave-fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The philosophy of these guys&nbsp;is scouting/player development first.&nbsp; They want to spend more&nbsp;resources in this area, and it seems to be a wise move.&nbsp; This year, the Cubs finally put more capital into the draft than they had in a while.&nbsp; In Carrie Muskat's article on Cubs.com, Epstein is quoted as saying that the Cubs' approach in this year's draft was "a significant moment [for the organization]," and that the Cubs were "finally getting it."&nbsp; We were thinking that the new management would have to turn the ship around completely, but it appears that the Ricketts already were spinning the wheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These guys are great hirings.&nbsp; All three were involved in creating the Red Sox teams that won the World Series in '04 and '07.&nbsp; It sounds like Hoyer was partly responsible for Schilling coming to the Sox&nbsp;for the&nbsp;'04 season.&nbsp; He also was responsible for aqcuiring Josh Beckett and Mike Lowell for Hanley Ramirez and Anibal Sanchez.&nbsp; Those&nbsp;players ended up&nbsp;being vital to the Sox in&nbsp;the '07 playoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now they are charged with the task of taking the Cubs to the promised land.&nbsp; They have to make a mountain out of twisted, smoldering Hendry-wreckage.&nbsp; It won't be easy.</p>
