  content: "I don't want to sound like too much of a Homer, but I would have to say
    the backyard is my favorite place to watch the Cubs.  \r\n\r\nCubs flags flying
    over head, 2 ice cold beers on tap, a new mounted LCD tv, sound run through outdoor
    speakers, pickled eggs and good friends cheering on the boys in blue.  I don't
    know, it's the place for me."

  content: "I can't disagree. Can't wait to experience the upgrades. The backyard
    doesn't damage the wallet like a bar will.\r\nI'm a homer too and most of the
    time prefer to watch it on my couch. It's the main reason I bought a new tv."

  content: 9 times out of 10 i prefer the exact ambiance corey and tawny have created
    for us in the backyard pub.  but for those few times a season when i just want
    to be "out" someplace enjoying the game with barflies i would suggest twenty also
    because i liked hearing the actual audio for the game over the speakers.  plus
    they gave us cool cubs beer glasses to take home. i love free stuff!

<p>Conditions for viewing last night's game outside of the Chicagoland area were not good. Even people who ponied up the near $200 for the MLB package on DirecTV (Corey) couldn't get it. I'll stay away from satellite/cable bashing since I'm sure there are blogs devoted entirely to doing just that, but it seems pretty ridiculous that those people aren't getting what they paid for: EVERY GAME.</p>
<p>Andy, his wife and I had stumbled&nbsp;across "Twenty" sports bar in Moline&nbsp;about a week earlier and were&nbsp;pleasantly&nbsp;surprised to find&nbsp;4 or 5&nbsp;sizable&nbsp;LCDs behind the bar all on Cubs action and the twenty or so speakers playing the sound. A rare find in a bar.&nbsp;After vetoing O'Keefe's because of the Kenny Chesney blasting out of the open door and windows we decided to give this new place a try. It turned out to be a great place to watch a game and had a good selection of beers on tap always served in the appropriate logo'd glass.</p>
<p>With a fresh paycheck in the bank, my girlfriend and I decided to head back to catch last nights game and try out the food. The food was decent for bar food. I had a tasty burger and fries. Hard to screw up. Again, I'll leave the culinary expertise to other blogs. The game, on the other hand, was not so good. They were nice enough to leave a few TVs on the DirecTV multi-feed so we could watch the baby Cubs game. It was nice to see the bartenders visibly upset at the fact they couldn't get the game. They even made several calls to DirecTV to find out they were subject to blackout. As you know the&nbsp;mini-Cubs lost to the mini-Marlins in 10. No mini-commentary on that game.&nbsp;It ended up being ok as the Bulls Celtics game was on and was probably one of the best basketball games I've ever seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole experience got me thinking we should run a poll to see what are people's favorite places to watch the game. I'll nominate Twenty and leave the rest open for suggestion. Most of us live in the Quad Cities, but feel free to make suggestions about other towns.</p>
<p>Oh, and I can't forget Fineran's backyard pub! No better place on a warm summer night.</p>
