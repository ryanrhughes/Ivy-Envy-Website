<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/07/Fukudome.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5792" title="Fukudome" src="/uploads/2011/07/Fukudome.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="235" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Kosuke Fukudome's time as a Cub is officially over. &nbsp;He was traded to the Cleveland Indians today for minor-league prospects Carlton Smith and Abner Abreu. &nbsp; Part of the deal was for the Cubs to still pay the bulk of the money owed to Fukudome for 2011 (4.7 million), ostensibly to make sure they received the best prospects possible in return.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fukudome had his highs and lows during his time in Chicago. &nbsp;His corkscrew swing, his failure to hit for a good average consistently, and his declining numbers as the seasons progressed were all sources of frustration for fans. &nbsp;In 2008, Kosuke was on the cover of&nbsp; an issue of&nbsp;<em>Sports Illustrated </em>that proclaimed, "Kosuke Fukudome can end the Cubs' 100-year wait."&nbsp;&nbsp;So that didn't happen, but personally, I am a fan of Fukudome. &nbsp;It was a pleasure to watch his plate discipline. &nbsp;He was able to take pitches in a two-strike count that missed the strike zone by a hair. &nbsp;His great eye made him stand out among his swing-happy Cubs teammates. &nbsp;He maintained a high OBP throughout his time with the Cubs (.369), and was a defensively sound right fielder with a good arm. &nbsp;As Hunter Pence recently discovered, Wrigley is not an easy place to play right field, but Kosuke did it with aplomb. &nbsp;Remember the thrill of his performance on opening day of '08? Fukudome hit a double in his first major league at-bat, and he tied the game in the ninth with a three-run homer. &nbsp;Though it was fairly rare, I loved seeing him ambush opposing pitchers with his power.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Indians are in need of an outfielder right now (they have two on the DL), and they are also a swing-happy lineup in need of some plate discipline. &nbsp;I hope Fukudome is able to help them out and that he plays well during his time in Cleveland.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here is a little info on the two players received by the Cubs in the Fukudome deal--</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/uploads/2011/07/Abreu.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5793" title="Abreu" src="/uploads/2011/07/Abreu.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="135" /></a>&nbsp;<strong>Abner Abreu</strong>, 22,&nbsp;is an outfielder who was playing at the high-A level in the Cleveland farm system. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.indiansprospectinsider.com/2010/03/indians-top-50-5-abner-abreu.html" target="_blank">This article</a> describes him as "an impressive athlete dripping with tools that has some of the best raw power of anyone in the entire organization." &nbsp;The problem is that his "tremendous upside" has yet to become a reality. &nbsp;Another bit of info in this article worth noting is that his favorite player is Alfonso Soriano. &nbsp;Hopefully he doesn't try to emulate him too much. &nbsp;This season, he is hitting .244 with 35 RBI and 12 home runs. &nbsp;There are a couple stats that stand out to me in particular. &nbsp;He has 19 stolen bases and has only been caught stealing three times. &nbsp;That is the good one. &nbsp;The bad one is that he has struck out 102 times in 336 at-bats. &nbsp;I think he is a decent acquisition for the Cubs. &nbsp;Perhaps being with a different organization/coaches will make a difference in his development.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/uploads/2011/07/Smith.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5794" title="Smith" src="/uploads/2011/07/Smith.jpg" alt="" /></a><strong>Carlton Smith</strong>, 25, is a pitcher who was playing at the triple-A level. &nbsp;He was being used as a reliever, and he was 2-3 with a 4.50 ERA. &nbsp;When you look at his stats, it looks like he had plenty of success earlier in his career as a starter. &nbsp;I'm not sure why he was switched to a relief pitcher--perhaps an injury. &nbsp;Though his ERA is a little high, he does have 46K in 46 innings pitched.</p></p>
