<p>If Cubs Convention 2012 doesn&rsquo;t fit into your schedule or budget and you live south of Chicago, you might want to consider going to Cubs Caravan in Peoria next Thursday, January 12<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>The Cubs have tentatively announced that six former Chiefs, including top Cubs prospects Brett Jackson, Josh Vitters and Matt Szczur will be appearing on the Caravan stop.&nbsp; Other players that are scheduled to appear on the Caravan are three former Chiefs that spent time in 2011 with the big league team: Tony Campana, Chris Carpenter and Casey Coleman.<br />
New coaches Chris Bosio, Jamie Quirk and Dave McKay will be joined by Scouting Director Joe Bohringer, Assistant GM Shiraz Rehman and Comcast announcer Dave Otto, who will serve as the event&rsquo;s emcee.</p>
<p>There is a 45 minute autograph session that starts at 4:45, which is followed by the program, which consists of a Q&amp;A segment and ticket/booster info on the Cubs and Chiefs, as well as a dinner.</p>
<p>The Cubs Caravan stop in Peoria will be at the Riverplex.&nbsp; Tickets are available at the Chiefs box office for $15, payable by cash or check.</p>
<p>I did contact the Chiefs box office to get information for those that are interested in the event and unable to purchase tickets at the box office.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are in this position, you may mail a check for $15 made out to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Central Illinois Cubs Boosters</span></strong> and include a note with your name and phone number, asking them to hold the tickets.&nbsp; Tickets must be picked up by 2:30 at the Chiefs box office.</p>
