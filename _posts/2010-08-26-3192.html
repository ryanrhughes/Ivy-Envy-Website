<p>First  off, we at Ivy Envy would like to apologize for the frequency of our  posts dropping off.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t want to write about the Cubs, so I can  only assume you have an equal amount of disinterest in reading about the Cubs, so let&rsquo;s call it  even.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s just a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our  bus trip was incredible, with 55 Cubs fans from the Quad Cities  boarding a charter bus and heading to Wrigley for a beautiful day of  baseball.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do a write-up about the bus trip in the next week (yeah, I said that about six weeks  ago about my Dodgers game summary).&nbsp; There are lots of great photos  trickling in on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946?ref=ts" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>, so keep checking in there.&nbsp; If you  took photos you would want to share, get ahold of me:&nbsp; corey@ivyenvy.com . Thanks  to everyone that went.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking we may need to consider&nbsp; having two  buses next year based on the interest I&rsquo;ve heard. </li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>We  got a bit of a shout-out in <a href="http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=507492" target="_blank">Matt Veto&rsquo;s column in today&rsquo;s  Dispatch/Argus</a> about the possibility of Ryne Sandberg being the next  Cubs manager when he quoted me and mentioned Ivy Envy.&nbsp; Veto covers a TON of local sports and it&rsquo;s cool to see them  give him the space to write about the Cubs. </li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>If  you listened to our NL Central preview podcast episodes, you&rsquo;ll  remember that we made a little wager with Brian over at <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggle.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo&rsquo;s  Goggles</a>.&nbsp; The bet was the following:&nbsp; If the Reds beat the Cubs in head-to-head victories this year, at the  end of the season, for three days, we will shut down Ivy Envy and when  you go to our website, you will be re-directed to his website.&nbsp; I really  didn&rsquo;t expect the Reds to destroy the Cubs this year in head-to-head games or in the overall standings, but that&rsquo;s  where we are, Cubs fans.&nbsp; So for a few days in early October, we will  disappear and you will be forced to read about Joey Votto.&nbsp; In case you  are wondering, going into this weekend&rsquo;s series in Cincinnati, the Reds lead the Cubs 10-3 in head-to-head games. It's a good thing the Reds will be back home because <a href="http://www.myfoxdfw.com/dpp/news/weird/082510-Woman-Allegedly-Masturbated-to-Porn-While-Driving" target="_blank">folks in Ohio don't know how to conduct themselves</a> when the Reds are on the road.<br />
</li><br />
</ul><br />
So  that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s going on around here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d like to comment on the Cubs,  but I just can&rsquo;t muster the desire right now.&nbsp; I am watching parts of  games, though.&nbsp; However, I told myself a few days ago that if the Cubs win one of these  remaining games in walk-off fashion and they proceed to celebrate, I  will literally not watch another game for the rest of the year.&nbsp; The  only way I could excuse this behavior is if the victory kept a winning streak of 8 games or more alive.&nbsp; It seemed like a  pretty ludicrous exception earlier this week, but now that they have  won 3 games in a row under Quade&hellip;&hellip;it&rsquo;s still ludicrous. </p>
