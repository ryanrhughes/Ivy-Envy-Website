<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt spend a lot of this episode looking at which players could, and maybe should, be traded away by the Cubs.  In times like these, it's hard to not look at the future of the club.  We discuss a few topics that listeners gave to us, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we read your entries for the photo caption contest.</p>
<p>We also read an email from Bob in the UK on his experiences following the Cubs from across the pond.  Follow us on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">"like" us on Facebook</a> for a chance to win tickets to the Midwest League's Homerun Derby and All-Star Game. &nbsp;We'll give those details out on Friday.</p>
