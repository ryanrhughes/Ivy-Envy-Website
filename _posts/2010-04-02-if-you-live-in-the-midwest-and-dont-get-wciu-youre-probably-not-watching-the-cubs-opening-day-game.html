  content: "I wish I would have read this earlier.  I'm in St. Louis, was out of my
    mind excited to watch opening day Cubbie baseball, and it looks like I won't be
    able to watch it on ESPN--even though I pay for ESPN!\r\n\r\nSo I pay for a channel
    that is broadcasting a game that I'm not allowed to watch.  Is MLB going to pay
    me back for the ESPN feed time I'm denied?  Seems like I'm denied a service I
    paid for.  (it's probably in the fine print of a \"contract\" I agreed to, but
    it seems against common sense)"

  content: I just re-read the article and noticed that although I'm part of the Midwest,
    Missouri wasn't listed as a Chicago-market area.  Hopefully I'll still get it
    on ESPN.

<p>As Opening Day looms, it's becoming more and more clear that those of us outside of WCIU's broadcast area, yet defined as the "Chicago-area Market" according to Major League Baseball and ESPN will not be able to watch this telecast.&nbsp; This includes major portions of Illinois, Iowa, Indiana and Wisconsin.&nbsp; We are located in the Quad Cities, which is on the border of Illinois and Iowa, about 2.5 hours from Chicago and we fall into this no-man's land when it comes to WCIU broadcasts.&nbsp; I <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1836" target="_blank">posted about this</a> when it was announced that Opening Day would be covered by WCIU and ESPN.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing about this whole situation is that because Opening Day falls the day after Easter, it would be the first Opening Day game that I can remember that I'd be able to watch live.&nbsp; Well, it appears that the only way for me to watch this game is finding some pirate feed on the internet.&nbsp; We'll see if last year's links work for that.&nbsp; If you are in a similar situation and would like to find out how to watch this on the internet, e-mail me:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:corey@ivyenvy.com">corey@ivyenvy.com</a> .&nbsp; If this doesn't work and I'm relegated to listening to the broadcast on the radio, I expect to be frantic and by the third inning, I will have angrily called DirecTV, Mediacom Cable, ESPN, Major League Baseball and the Cubs front office.&nbsp; The idea that a fan that is able to watch the nearly every game of a Cubs season is kept from watching Opening Day because of money and bureaucracy is quite deflating.</p>
<p>So here's a quick run-down of proof that we won't be able to watch this game:</p>
<p>*&nbsp; As I mentioned, the game is <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=chc" target="_blank">broadcast on WCIU with national coverage by ESPN</a>.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; According to ESPN, the <a href="http://espn.go.com/espn/contact" target="_blank">game will be broadcast on WCIU and CSN Chicago</a>.&nbsp; So ESPN is blacking out the game in areas that fall in the broadcast areas of these two networks.&nbsp; Here's is what ESPN told me through e-mail:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>  I am sorry you can not receive the Cubs opening day broadcast in<br />
your area.Please contact your local cable provider to see if they<br />
can provide coverage for you.</p>
<p>During the Major League Baseball season, ESPN is obligated to<br />
occasionally provide alternate programming in some markets due to<br />
local/regional coverage.</p>
<p>On Opening Day, ESPN must provide alternate programming in each<br />
team market during its MLB telecast window.  Following are the<br />
regional sports networks which will televise the game(s)in your<br />
area:</p>
<p>Chicago Cubs (CSNC or WCIU)</p>
<p>These markets will receive ESPNEWS during the local MLB<br />
telecast window.</pre><br />
</blockquote><br />
*&nbsp; According to CSN Chicago's website and my DirecTV schedule, <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/pages/tvlisting?showdate=1270440000" target="_blank">they are not broadcasting the game, but rather the Indians vs. White Sox game</a>.&nbsp; CSN+ shows no broadcast until Wednesday, April 7th - Cubs vs. Braves.&nbsp; I have no idea why CSN Chicago is included in this by ESPN.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; DirecTV's website verifies that the game will be blacked out on ESPN and they will flip over to ESPN News.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I called Mediacom Cable and they said that the game will be blacked out on ESPN and they will not be able to put the Cubs vs. Braves broadcast on any other channel.</p>
<p>So that's it.&nbsp; The game will not be televised in an area where probably 80% of baseball fans are Cubs fans.&nbsp; Well done, MLB and ESPN.</p>
