<p>This weekend, we will be recording an off-topic podcast.&nbsp; We will pull out our baseball card collections and see what happens.</p>
<p>We want to hear your baseball card stories.&nbsp; Amazing trades, cards tossed aside that you wish you had back, favorite brand/years/designs.&nbsp; Send us your stories and we'll put them on the air.&nbsp; All you have to do is call the following phone number which is a voicemail line:&nbsp; 206-203-1919.&nbsp; If you're not comfortable with your voice being broadcast to the world, you can e-mail the stories to me at corey@ivyenvy.com and your e-mail will be read by former St. Ambrose football play-by-play broadcaster and regular Ivy Envy guest, Matt Veto.</p>
