  content: The division is pretty rough.  Lot of losing records for sure.  And other
    than the Cards, any divisional series is pretty much a toss up

God, make the hurting stop.&nbsp; I'm tempted to think things like, "Well, this is an much-improved Pirates team."&nbsp; But improved from what?&nbsp; Look at this crumby-ass division.&nbsp; Anyone can beat anyone.&nbsp; The Cubs are a moribund team in a superfluous division.&nbsp; The Astros swept the Cardinals.&nbsp; The Pirates have made the Cubs look silly.&nbsp; The Cubs, Brewers, Pirates, and Astros have almost the same records, all equally terrible.&nbsp; I had been really looking forward to watching Cubs baseball this summer.&nbsp; Do I already have to go into<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1362" target="_blank"> just-enjoy-the-game mode</a>?&nbsp; I can do that, but I'd rather enjoy the game with the Cubs in contention for the division title.&nbsp; These guys have barely put together any games in which pitching, defense, and offense have all been solid.&nbsp; I have a sinking feeling that we are going to be watching mediocre baseball from the Cubs all season.&nbsp; We might have to just try to enjoy watching Byrd go down with the ship (man was I tempted to type "Admiral" in front of his name).</p>
<p>Also, people need to put some effort and energy into <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1039" target="_blank">supporting their own goddamn team</a> instead of expending that energy to <a href="http://www.cubssuckclub.com/" target="_blank">hate another</a>.</p>
