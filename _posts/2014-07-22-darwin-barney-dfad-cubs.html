  content: Likeable guy.....  I just wish he could hit.  But he was given more than
    enough time to turn around.  Best of luck for the future Darwin!

  content: I wish it was a trade, not a DFA. Makes it better somehow in my mind. I
    rooted so hard for Barney. I hope he finds a team and has success. On a side note,
    I met him once and he was the nicest guy. And at spring training this year he
    saw my son wearing his jersey and waved his glove at him and gave him a huge smile.
    Made my son's whole year. :)

  content: I understand, but it's sad. Wish he could have found his bat. There were
    many days when his glove was the most exciting thing to watch on the Cubs. I think
    it could be a while before we have another Gold Glove winning 2B.

  content: Troy Taylor You're probably right about it being a while until the Cubs
    have another Gold Glove 2nd baseman.  It will be nice to some options that could
    produce in ways that Barney could never dream of.

    to see him go. It just feels like another tiny step in the right direction for
    the cubs.

<p>Boni activated, Barney DFA</p>&mdash; Mark Gonzales (@MDGonzales) <a href="https://twitter.com/MDGonzales/statuses/491663968562606081">July 22, 2014</a></blockquote><br />

<p>With Emilio Bonifacio returning from the disabled list and Arismendy Alcantara holding his own in the big leagues, the Cubs have designated Darwin Barney for assignment.  </p>
<p>Barney was an easy player to support after he fought his way onto the Cubs during Spring Training in 2011.  A gold glove winner in 2012, he had much more value in the field for the Cubs than he did with a bat.  </p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2012/11/Darwin-Barney.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2012/11/Darwin-Barney-300x199.jpg" alt="Darwin Barney" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7910" /></a>As far as the season as a whole goes, he's been pretty ineffective, hitting .230/.265/.328 and those numbers were much worse before his .385 with 2 doubles and 2 triples in the 10 games he's played in the month of July.  </p>
<p>With his recent hot streak, the hope was that the Cubs would be able to move Barney to a team that needs a solid defensive 2<sup>nd</sup> baseman, but it looks like there weren't many phone calls coming in.  </p>
<p>If Alcantara is staying up with the Cubs, this move would allow the Cubs to use Bonifacio and Alcantara at 2<sup>nd</sup> and CF. </p>
<p>Like most Cubs fans, I really liked Barney and I hope he lands somewhere and he does well.   A move like this was inevitable and there probably weren't many teams in baseball that would have given Barney the playing time that the Cubs of the last few years could offer.  </p>
