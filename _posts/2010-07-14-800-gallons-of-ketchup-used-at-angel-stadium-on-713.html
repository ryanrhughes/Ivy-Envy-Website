So the All-Star Game happened, and the usual coma-inducing game promised to be even more of a sedative for Cubs fans as only Marlon Byrd made the cut.&nbsp; If you only tuned in for the ninth inning, you saw the most exciting part of the game, and that excitement was provided by none other than Byrd.&nbsp; For those of you who didn't tune in--AL catcher John Buck hit an awkward ball in front of Byrd in right field, and Byrd had to make a decision whether to dive for it or let it fall.&nbsp; Meanwhile, David Ortiz froze on the base path between first and second in case Byrd made the catch.&nbsp; Marlon allowed the ball to fall right in front of him and snapped a throw to second to force Ortiz.&nbsp; That play was the second out of the inning, so Byrd contributed in a big way to the National League victory.&nbsp; In addition to walking and scoring a run earlier in the game, Byrd helped preserve the win with his defense.&nbsp; Of course this long-time-coming N.L. victory comes in a year in which the Cubs are pretty much out of the playoff race already, but still, it has been kind of a pain in the ass watching the A.L. win every year going back to when "Ironic" by Alanis Morrisette was inexplicably a popular song.</p>
<p>Also, according to MLB.com, 800 gallons of ketchup and 78,000 pounds of ice were used during the game.&nbsp; Whoop-de-shit.&nbsp; According to my count, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver said "Andy Pettitte" about 78,000 times.&nbsp; Also, Tim McCarver made a differentiation between two pitchers with high-nineties fastballs (I think they were Price and Verlander)--one of them threw a "hard" high-nineties fastball, and the other threw a "soft" high-nineties fastball.&nbsp; What do you think that means?</p>
