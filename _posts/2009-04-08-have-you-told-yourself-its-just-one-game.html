<p>The last thing I wanted to do this morning was climb up a cold aluminum ladder to pull down my "W" flag.&nbsp; But there were points last year that I'm sure I jinxed the Cubs by being lazy and leaving it up.&nbsp; That, single-handedly, led to the few Cubs losing streaks...I'm sure of it.</p>
<p>What we saw last night could become a reoccurring theme in 2009.&nbsp; On the nights that the Cubs have difficulty generating offense (that seems to be games that Dempster pitches on the road), the bullpen will hurt us.&nbsp; It's too early to criticize Kevin Gregg.&nbsp;&nbsp; I keep trying to tell myself that about Fukudome, too.&nbsp; If the Cubs can have the patience to let him hang himself, I should be able to do the same.&nbsp; I'm just glad that the Cubs are deep enough to allow him the adequate time to either prove himself or quietly go away.</p>
<p>It's early.&nbsp; I won't allow myself to look at stats or numbers until next Monday.&nbsp; All I know is that I'd be more than happy to climb up that cold aluminum ladder tomorrow morning.</p>
