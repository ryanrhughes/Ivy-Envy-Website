<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="/uploads/2014/06/Kyle-Schwarber.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10062" src="/uploads/2014/06/Kyle-Schwarber-300x199.jpg" alt="June 15, 2013:" width="300" height="199" /></a>According to a tweet by Carrie Muskat, the Cubs have reached an agreement with Kyle Schwarber, signing him for 3.125 million. &nbsp;The slot value for the fourth pick is 4.621 million, so the Cubs saved&nbsp;approximately 1.5 million dollars on this under-slot deal. &nbsp;Schwarber was projected to be picked somewhere within the 10-20 range, and the allotments for those slots are all in the 2-million-dollar range. &nbsp;The money that the Cubs have saved by signing Schwarber under the allotted slot value will allow them to offer more money to some of the players drafted in higher rounds whose "signability" is in question. &nbsp;For example, it might be difficult&nbsp;to persuade someone like the Cubs' sixth round pick, Dylan Cease, to forgo his commitment to Vanderbilt by offering him the $269,500 slot value, but the Cubs will have the leverage now to offer him more than that amount if necessary.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many have said that Schwarber was the best college hitter available. &nbsp;According to <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/prospects/watch/y2014/#list=draft" target="_blank">his write-up on MLB.com</a>, he has above-average hitting and power grades. &nbsp;&nbsp;Whether he will be able to remain a catcher in the Cubs system could be in doubt, however, as his grades for throwing,&nbsp;defense, and framing pitches rate below-average. &nbsp;For more on Kyle Schwarber, check out <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/iu-fan-analysis-kyle-schwarber/" target="_blank">DeRose's post about him</a> from earlier this week.</p></p>
