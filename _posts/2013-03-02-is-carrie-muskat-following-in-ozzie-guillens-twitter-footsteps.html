<p>Most baseball fans know what an entertaining read <a href="http://twitter.com/ozzieguillen" target="_blank">Ozzie Guillen's tweets</a> are.  I feel like Ozzie is past his Twitter prime, but much like <a href="http://twitter.com/josecanseco" target="_blank">Jose Canseco</a>, it doesn't take him long to escalate his presence and launch into rants and observations to leave you entertained and baffled, often in the same tweet.  </p>
<p>The MLB season is a long one not just for the players and managers, but also the beat writers that cover the teams.  <a href="http://twitter.com/carriemuskat" target="_blank">On Twitter, Carrie Muskat</a> is typically pretty straight-forward and middle-of-the-road.  Nothing she puts out there will shock you.  But recently, I have to admit that a few of her tweets have caught me off-guard and make me wonder if this becomes the season that Carrie lets her hair down.</p>

<p>Either Carrie is having some fun with her job, or covering the Cubs over the last few years has gotten to her.  </p>
