<p>The title of Asshat of the Week is being shared this week by White Sox Manager Ozzie Guillen and GM Kenny Williams.&nbsp; Ozzie for his comments about Wrigley and Kenny for his comments about the Cubs.&nbsp; These guys have a major little-brother complex <a id="more"></a><a id="more-102"></a>when it comes to the Cubs.&nbsp; I don't need to comment or analyze these comments...here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Ozzie Guillen:&nbsp; Co-Asshat of the Week</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are going to take batting practice and the rats look bigger than a pig out there,&rdquo; said Guillen, referring to the batting cages under the right-field bleachers. &ldquo;You want to take a look?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the rats out there are lifting weights,&rdquo; added Guillen, drawing huge laughter from the large crowd of assembled media.</p>
<p>..."What&rsquo;s wrong with saying I don&rsquo;t like this ballpark?&rdquo; Guillen said. &ldquo;You ask any player which one they like less and they might throw in some names. Ask me about it, and this is the one I pick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a museum. They like to come to Wrigley Field. I don&rsquo;t say people don&rsquo;t like to come here. I say Ozzie don&rsquo;t like to come here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hey, you have to do what you have to do,&rdquo; Guillen added. &ldquo;Wake up in the morning and go to Wrigley Field is not a good thing. But it&rsquo;s fun to play against them.&rdquo;</blockquote><br />
<strong>Kenny Williams:&nbsp; Co-Asshat of the Week</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>''The unfortunate thing for me is it's a shame that a certain segment of Chicago refused to enjoy a baseball championship being brought to their city. The only thing I can say is, 'Happy anniversary.'''</blockquote><br />
On whether or not he could imagine being the GM of the Cubs:</p>
<blockquote><p>''That would be a betrayal,'' Williams said before a long pause. ''God, I would really, really have to need the job. Oh, wow, really need the job.''</p>
<p>''Let me just throw out one question: What happens if we win another one before they win one?'' he said.</p>
<p>After hearing the reply that maybe nothing would change, Williams said, ''Well, my goal is to find out.''</blockquote><br />
