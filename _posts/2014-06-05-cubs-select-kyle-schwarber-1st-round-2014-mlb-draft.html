<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/Kyle-Schwarber.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/06/Kyle-Schwarber-300x199.jpg" alt="June 15, 2013:" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10062" /></a>The Cubs have selected Kyle Schwarber with the 4th overall pick in the first round of the 2014 MLB Draft.  </p>
<p>For the second draft in a row, the Cubs drafted a top college bat and probably the best bat available.  In 2013 it was Kris Bryant and this year, it's Kyle Schwarber.  Schwarber, a 21 year-old Ohio-native and Indiana Hoosier stands 6 feet tall and weighs 240lbs.  </p>
<p>A catcher/outfielder, Schwarber will probably end up in a corner outfield spot or first base.  He has shown the ability to hit for average and power and that's expected to continue.  With Indiana this season, he hit .348/.456/.643 with 13 HRs.  He had a strikeout rate of 10% and a walk rate of 15%.  That patience at the plate is something he's shown all three seasons with Indiana.  </p>
<p>For a big fellow, Schwarber has some speed - 6 triples (team leading) and 10 stolen bases to go along with that power.  </p>
<p>Here's some of Schwarber's power:<br />

<p>MLB ranked Schwarber at the 16th prospect in the draft.  Because Schwarber was not projected to go that high, the Cubs are probably thinking this is an opportunity to sign him under-slot.  This gives them the flexibility to stockpile arms in later rounds.  </p>
<p>Because of his age, it's possible that Schwarber could move quickly through the system.  In the short-term, I'd expect him to spend most (if not all) of this season with Boise.</p>
