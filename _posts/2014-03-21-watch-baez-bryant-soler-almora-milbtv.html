<p>Cubs fans got a sneak-peek at the future of the organization this Spring Training. As the roster is whittled down leading up to the regular season, Cubs fans will probably feel a let-down as they look at the Cubs Opening Day roster.</p>
<p>We are still (at least) months away from seeing Javier Baez at Wrigley Field, and the rest of the top prospects are potentially months (Bryant) or year(s) (Soler, Almora) behind him. Just because you don't live in Des Moines, Iowa or Knoxville, Tennessee doesn't mean you have to wait until these prospects land in Chicago to see them play. Minor League Baseball has released for purchase, <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/multimedia/milbtv.jsp" target="_blank">MiLB.TV for the 2014 season</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-21-at-10.43.03-AM.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-21-at-10.43.03-AM.png" alt="Cubs on MiLB.TV" width="619" height="578" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9257" /></a></p>
<p>By subscribing at $49.<sup>99</sup> for the year, or $12.<sup>99</sup> per month, you will have access to the following games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iowa Cubs (AAA) - &nbsp;All Games</li>
<li>Tennessee Smokies (AA) - All Home Games and All Road Games (except versus Huntsville, Chattanooga, Mobile)</li>
<li>Kane County Cougars (A) - Road Games at Dayton, Great Lakes, West Michigan, and Wisconsin</li><br />
</ul><br />
Your MiLB.TV subscription includes the live stream of the games, on-demand complete game archives and mobile viewing on iOS devices through the MiLB First Pitch app. Cubs minor league baseball will be fun to watch, especially Iowa and Tennessee.  At $50 for the season, it may be worth your sanity to watch more Iowa and Tennessee games than Chicago Cubs games. </p>
<p>If you have already subscribed, or are considering subscribing to MLB.TV, you can add MiLB.TV to your package at a discounted rate.  Unfortunately, MiLB is not wise enough to have an affiliate program...or we're not wise enough to not give them free advertising with this post.  </p>
