<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this mid-week episode of the podcast, we talk about the ups and downs of the Cubs series against the Cardinals this week.  In the 4 games in 3 days, the Cubs gave us a lot to be happy about and were one strike from taking 3 of 4 from the Cardinals.  </p>
