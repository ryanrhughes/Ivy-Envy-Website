<p>The Cubs won the series, 3 games to 1 and the Cubs offense put on quite a show at Great American Ball Park.  We spend most of the episode talking about the three games in detail. </p>
<p>We have a few scary stats of the week, a couple of internet muscle flexes, two asshats of the week and we announce the winner of the box of Rizzo's cereal.  </p>
