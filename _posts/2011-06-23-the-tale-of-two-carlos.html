<p>I've been pretty hard on Carlos Pena (or Peenya as Keith Moreland prefers to call him) early in the season. He nearly swept the first few "scary stats of the week," a regular addition to the podcast. Not hard to do when you're hitting in the neighborhood of .150 with no home runs.</p>
<p>But wait, there's a new Carlos in town. In the last seven days Carlos has hit 4 of his 14 home runs. After going 0 for in April and March, he's hit seven in both May and June. At this pace he could hit another 21 on the year. His batting average has jumped to .220, he leads the team with 38 RBI (kind of sad) and walks with 43. And, as expected, his defense has been great.</p>
<p>That's the good, but there's still some bad. Versus lefties he's hitting .075 with just 4 RBI. That's quite a disparity when compared to .267 and 34 RBI vs. righties. The most important factor is that his recent spike in numbers hasn't really translated to more wins.</p>
<p>I didn't really have an intended conclusion to this post other than to point out the Jekyll and Hyde nature of his stats. If he can keep up his current production I think most fans will be satisfied. Carlos is a really&nbsp;like-able&nbsp;guy. I'm pulling for him and hoping I don't have to give him any more "scary stats of the week."</p>
