<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Arrieta.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Arrieta-300x195.jpg" alt="Jake Arrieta" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9105" /></a>We will get our first look at Jake Arrieta on Saturday as the Cubs host the Cardinals.  Arrieta was slated for the back end of the rotation for the 2014 season, but after experiencing some shoulder tightness in the off-season, it was clear early-on in Spring Training that Arrieta would not be starting the season with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>If, like most Cubs fans, you lost interest in the Cubs mid-season last year, Arrieta came over to the Cubs from the Orioles with Pedro Strop in the interview that sent Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger to Baltimore.  </p>
<p>Arrieta started 9 games for the Cubs in 2013, going 4-2 with a 3.66 ERA.  Arrieta has pitched in five games for (High-A) Daytona and (Double-A) Tennessee.  In four starts with Tennessee, Arrieta 1-1 with a 1.26 ERA.  In 14 1/3 innings, he struck out 11 and walked 5.  </p>
<p>With a fastball in the low 90's and a curveball in the low 80's, Arrieta is a decent #5 for this Cubs team.  He doesn't miss many bats and his strikeout totals are fairly low.  Arrieta's return will likely not have a huge impact on how the Cubs are playing right now.  Although, we should hopefully see a bit of an upgrade out of that spot in the rotation.  Carlos Villanueva filled in and his 1-5 record and 10.42 ERA hasn't exactly boosted his trade value.  </p>
<p>Villanueva hasn't pitched as poorly as it appears.  He's been asked to start and pitch out of the bullpen in the first month of the season and his ERA is misleading, as he has a 4.17 FIP. I think once Villanueva settles back into the bullpen and can work out of that role, we should see his numbers (and performances) stabilize.   </p>
