<p>I have seen some buzz about moving Fukudome to center field so Micah Hoffpauir could get in the lineup, including in <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080609&amp;content_id=2877067&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">this mailbag post on Cubs.com</a>.&nbsp; I realize that Hoffpauir has shown himself to be a good hitter, <a id="more"></a><a id="more-95"></a>but what about Reed Johnson?&nbsp; Do people just think that he isn't good enough to be the every day guy?&nbsp; Sure, his average is down to .265 right now, but I see that as a result of him not playing every day.&nbsp; Mike Fontenot seemed to have the same drop-off on offense when he was relegated to an as-needed player.&nbsp; When Johnson was playing every day, he seemed like he would be able to hit close to .300--his career average is .280.&nbsp; Johnson has also shown himself to be superb defensively;&nbsp; He has made Edmonds-esque&nbsp; spectacular plays this season, and I would like to see him in center more than Edmonds because of his speed and better offensive production.&nbsp;</p>
