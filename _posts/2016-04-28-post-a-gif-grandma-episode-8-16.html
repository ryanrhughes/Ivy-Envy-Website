<p>Miguel Montero hits the DL and Kris Bryant exits Thursday's game with an ankle injury.  We talk about the impact of both of those injuries.  </p>
<p>Andy and Corey watched the South Bend Cubs this week and share a few thoughts.  We go through listener questions, share a few INSANE (good) scary stats and Andy shares a Rube Waddell story.  </p>
