<blockquote>&ldquo;You have to build an organization. You get tired of me saying this, but there are no shortcuts.&rdquo; -Theo Epstein</blockquote><br />
With Spring Training 2014 coming to an end, I think it is safe to say that Cubs fans have reason to be excited about the future. As the top ranked prospects murdered baseballs and windshields, the youngest international Cubs prospects made some progress towards a promotion to A level baseball.</p>
<p>The last international &ldquo;draft&rdquo; was an expensive boon for the Cubs. They had an allotment of $4.56 million and ending up going over $8 million dollars. The Cubs are now limited to how much they can sign prospects for. The massive upside to this is the Cubs were able to sign 27 talented individuals.</p>
<p>This is a departure from how the Cubs approached international players. The idea of improving a club from the ground up has been enthusiastically embraced. The new Dominican Republic Academy is proof. Many of the new international players are very young. Eloy Jimenez (#1 international prospect) and Gleyber Torres (#3 international prospect) are only 17 years-old. The other players signed are also around this age. Because of age, many of these ballplayers are at the new facility in the Dominican Republic. The Ricketts' really made an effort to not only get the best coaches for these players, but to also engage them off the field. This facility includes four classrooms, a cafeteria, dormitories, and a theater.</p>

<p>With that being said, the &ldquo;Baby Cubs&rdquo; are starting to make waves of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Eloy Jimenez</strong> is a monster at 17 years-old. He is 6'4, with speed and an absolute cannon for an arm. When he makes it to the single A club, he will likely be in Right field. The major area of work, that needs to develop further, is his hitting.</p>
<p><strong>Gleyber Torres</strong> is still growing into his adult body. When the Cubs signed him he was a shortstop. It looks like he might end up at another position. He has a strong arm and is a hitting machine. He makes good contact with the ball and sprays it all over the field. If the power comes, he could be a major offensive weapon. Hitting bombs in Wrigley is still a long way off, but this will be an interesting year for his development.</p>
<p><strong>Erling Moreno</strong> has started to pitch with more velocity. He is a RHP that the Cubs splurged on, spending $850,000. This is a good chuck of money for an international pitcher. They are very difficult to project and tend to not work out. Moreno might not be in that same camp. When he was signed he had a fastball that only approached the high 80's. He and his fastball have continued to mature. His other offerings are solid change-up and a curveball. He will likely spend another year playing in the Dominican Summer League.</p>
<p><strong>Jefferson Mejia</strong> is a bit older than the other players signed. He is 19 years-old and stands 6'7. He has put on some weight, but that has increased the speed of his fastball. His best pitch, at the moment, is his change-up. As his fastball increases in speed, he could have a real one-two punch. He also has a good curveball. He is expected to play in the Dominican Summer League.</p>
<p><strong>Jen-Ho Tseng</strong> is the closest to A ball. He has bounced back from his poor showing at the World Baseball Classic. His best pitch, is his curveball. It just falls off the table. His other pitches also are good. His fastball sits around the mid 90s and his change-up is consistently thrown in the low 80s. Tseng also throws a splitter that is still a work in progress. Because of his international experience and his recent pitching, it is very likely he will be pitching with either Kane County or Boise. Here is a video, by Baseball America, that shows Tseng in action.<br />

<p>These are just a few the of the &ldquo;Future, Future Cubs&rdquo;. With this shotgun approach to the international signings, the Cubs are bound to get a few of them right.</p>
