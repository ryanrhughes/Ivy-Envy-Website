<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />In this, the 456<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we are in full off-season mode.  Cubs Convention sold out within seconds (probably) and we talk about how this is an indication of how difficult it will be to see the Cubs in 2017.  </p>
<p>Kurt runs through the various awards that the Cubs have won in this MLB award-season.  We also look at a couple that the Cubs were not able to win. The Cubs have added several players to their 40-man roster to avoid losing them in the Rule 5 draft.  The Cubs sent several prospects to the Arizona Fall League and now that the season has wrapped up, we look at how they did.  There's also one former Cubs player that drew a lot of attention in the Fall League this year. </p>
<p>Then, we go through what we perceive to be team needs and talk about the different options the Cubs have to address those needs. </p>
