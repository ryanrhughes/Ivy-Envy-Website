<p>We will be recording for the podcast tonight and if you are in the Quad Cities, we'd like to invite you down to Twenty Sports Bar in Moline.&nbsp; We've mentioned Twenty many times on here and the podcast as the best place in the QC to watch the Cubs.</p>
<p>Twenty is now a sponsor for the podcast and we will be doing a test run down there tonight to get a feel for recording at the place and we will eventually do some live shows down there where you can call in and gripe about things with us.</p>
<p>So head to downtown Moline, drink some beer and take a Cubs pint glass home with you.&nbsp; That's how they roll at Twenty.&nbsp; We'll watch some of the Cubs game...record a show...and then hang out some more.</p>
