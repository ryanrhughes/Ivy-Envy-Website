As we enter our 7th season of blogging and our 6th season of podcasting (nearly 250 episodes) on the Chicago Cubs, we were long overdue for a face-lift. If this is the first time you've visited our website, or if you're not familiar with us, check out the welcome video at the top right side of the main page of the website.</p>
<p>If you're a regular visitor to our site, you are surely noticing some of our changes. We have added an <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/about/" target="_blank">About Ivy Envy</a> page and a page for our individual <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/bios/" target="_blank">Bios</a>. One of the things we wanted to do with our re-design is make our site a lot more readable. We started as a blog in 2008 and added the podcast prior to the 2009 season. As we put more effort into our podcasting, the blogging on IvyEnvy.com suffered. We are thrilled to announce that we have brought some writers on to provide you with written content on the Cubs in between our weekly podcast episodes. Starting Monday, you will start to see blog posts by DeRose, Luke Jett, Matt Veto and Sean Clement. Kurt, Andy, and I will also make an effort to write more.</p>
<p>We have also improved our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live-podcast/" target="_blank">Live Broadcast</a> and <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live-game-chat/" target="_blank">Live Game Chat</a> pages by installing a new chat client that allows you to log in via your social network accounts. If you are checking our new site out during our "Online Open House" between 2:30pm and 4:30pm on Saturday, March 15th, 2014, head over to the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live-game-chat/" target="_blank">Live Game Chat</a> right now and log in. We are there and want to know what you think of the new site. Also, the Cubs game is on WGN-TV, so let's talk some Cubs baseball.</p>
<p>You will also notice in the rotating image that we are announcing two Ivy Envy events. The first is <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/iowa-cubs-game-meet/" target="_blank">a meet-up we will have at the May 24th Iowa Cubs game</a> at Principle Park in Des Moines, Iowa. Our big event of the 2014 will be the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/ivy-envy-weekend-lake/" target="_blank">2nd Annual Ivy Envy Weekend at the Lake</a>. We will be announcing more details on these events, and potentially other events, in the near future.</p>
<p>The last aspect of the website we want to bring to your attention is the link on the right-hand side of the page that will take you to our Patreon page. Since we started the podcast, our goal has been to keep the podcast free for anyone who wants to hear our commentary on Cubs baseball. As we head into our sixth season, we have spent significantly more money on the podcast than revenue it's ever generated. We are so grateful that our listener-base has grown. When podcasters want to cover their costs or make money off their podcasts, they have a few options, and one of the most common ways is to make content premium, or in other words, you'd have to pay to listen. We refuse to do that.</p>

Instead, we have started a <a href="http://www.patreon.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a>. If you are familiar with Kickstarter, Patreon is very similar, except you can support projects by pledging a monthly donation. We have put a lot of time and thought into setting up our Patreon campaign, with the goal of giving people that pledge a fair return on their pledge. We have created perks at every level. Our pledging levels start at $1/month, which is just 25 cents per podcast episode. You will notice that the perks increase in value as you go up the levels. <a href="http://www.patreon.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Check out our Patreon campaign here.</a></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting our redesigned website. We are so honored that you have chosen us as a source of Cubs news and commentary. Go Cubs!</p>
