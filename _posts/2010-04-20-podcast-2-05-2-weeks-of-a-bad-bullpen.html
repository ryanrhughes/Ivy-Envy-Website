<p>Corey and Andy welcome returning guest Brian and discuss the first two weeks of the 2010 season.  So far, the season has been filled with games blown by the bullpen, a sketchy offense that fails to generate runs and Alfonso Soriano feeling some heat.  We introduce a new segment - "Question of the Week" and we give some more details on our event at Twenty Sports Grille on April 26th.</p>
