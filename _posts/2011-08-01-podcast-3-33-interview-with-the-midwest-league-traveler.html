<p>Before Thursday night's Peoria Chiefs vs. Quad Cities River Bandits game at Modern Woodmen Park in Davenport, Iowa, I had the pleasure of meeting up with Craig Wieczorkiewicz, otherwise known as The Midwest League Traveler.  Craig is on a summer-long mission of going to all 16 ballparks in the Midwest League.  You can read all of his descriptions of the ballparks and the games he witnesses at <a href="http://www.mwltraveler.com" target="_blank">www.mwltraveler.com</a> or you can follow him on Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/MWLtraveler" target="_blank">@MWLtraveler</a>.  </p>
