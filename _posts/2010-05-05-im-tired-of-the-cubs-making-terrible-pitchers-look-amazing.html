  content: Charlie Freaking Morton.  Wow.  And how is that guy at 0-5 not being sent
    down to the minors?  Is Pittsburgh's rotation really that bad?

<p>You all follow the Cubs as closely as I do.  You watch as many games as I do.  You know that if the Cubs are facing a rookie pitcher, it's probably a good idea to get ahold of your bookie and put a chunk of money down on the other team for that game.  The Cubs are notorious for making young rookies look like future Cy Young winners.  </p>
<p>The Cubs also enjoy giving bad opposing pitchers a little confidence boost.  On the receiving end of that tonight was Charlie Morton.  Old Charlie entered the game 0-5 on the season with a 12.57 ERA.  It is damn impressive to carry an 0-5 record into a game on May 5th.  In 5 starts he had averaged less than 4 innings per appearance.  Charlie took the mound tonight and held back the Cubs bats.  He gave up 2 runs and 5 hits in 6 innings of work.  The Cubs made Charlie Morton look like a legitimate big league pitcher...not just a guy that could make the Pirates roster.  </p>
<p>But it wasn't the first time the Cubs aided Morton.  His last win was September 30, 2009.  He walked into that game with a 4-9 record and an ERA of 5.01.  In that game, he pitched a 4-hit complete game shutout.  So this is what the Cubs do.  Every time they face a pitcher you don't really know anything about, assume he will handcuff them at the plate.  This trend does not seem to be ending anytime soon, so put some money on the game and sit back and watch it happen again.  </p>
