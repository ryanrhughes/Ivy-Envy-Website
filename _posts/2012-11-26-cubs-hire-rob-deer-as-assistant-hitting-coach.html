<p>When I heard today that the Cubs hired Rob Deer to fill the role as Assistant Hitting Coach, I realized that while I know his name, the extent of my knowledge of the gentleman is limited to this:  </p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rob-Deer-2.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Rob-Deer-2-214x300.jpg" alt="" title="Rob Deer 2" width="214" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7979" /></a></center></p>
<p>I seem to remember stacking up Rob Deer baseball cards like Andy and his massive Bip Roberts collection.  It seemed that every pack I opened in the late 80s contained a Rob Deer card.  So if the Cubs dig up this guy, he must know something about hitting, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe.  If he knows a lot about hitting, he sure doesn't know how to do it.  Or at least he didn't when he was a ballplayer.  In his 11-year career, Deer is a .220 hitter and had a strikeout rate of almost 200 per 162 games. For 20 years, he held the AL record for most strikeouts in a season.  </p>
<p>So should we be concerned that this guy will be instructing our batters how to hit the ball?  While looking through the hitting coaches in Major League Baseball, there are quite a few names that are recognizable, but there's also a lot of names of guys that had insignificant careers as players.  </p>
<p>If you are wondering about his qualifications, Deer has been a roving hitting instructor for the Padres.  Bruce Miles posted this quote today, which was dug up by The Hardball Times.  Deer was asked about being a hitting coach after striking out so much and having such a low batting average.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I answer that a lot,&rdquo; responded Deer, who was minor-league hitting coordinator for the Padres at the time. &ldquo;I don't teach the way I hit. I understand how to hit .300. I know what it takes. We tell the guys to be selectively aggressive. We want that to be their approach. We tell them 'Be patiently aggressive.' That's our motto. What does it mean? If you get a good pitch to hit and you take it, that's your fault. We don't ever want to take aggressiveness away. But, we don't want to swing at bat pitches, either. I'll be the first to admit I don't want them to hit like I did."</blockquote></p>
<p>Deer is a former teammate to Cubs manager Dale Sveum and this may be more of a move to help Sveum shape the team's attitude and clubhouse than anything else.  Familiarity within the coaching staff can be valuable. Deer will be assisting James Rowson and with a roster this young, Rowson could probably use some help.  </p>
