    catch save Silva from even further damage?

  content: "\"Bizzay\" is out this year, but the gold mine combo of Pepsi and the
    Black Eyed Peas is not. There's a new one...\"One Tribe\". They aired it a lot.
    The best lyric \"Forget about all that EVA\". Eva means evil. It had to be changed
    so it would rhyme with amnesia. Makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nTime for my first bold
    preseason prediction. Jeff Kennard will not make the big league roster. 0.2 IP,
    54.00 ERA. You heard it here first."

  content: I laughed really hard at the bud light commercial, actually. But that was
    just the first time. I am sure I will have a different reaction the third time.

<p>Today was the first televised game of the 2010 pre-season and I am very happy that Lou Piniella decided to hold off the Carlos Silva start for a televised game.&nbsp; What a pitching line:</p>
<p><strong>2IP - 7H - 6ER - 2HR - 27.0 ERA</strong><br />
Was it fried chicken grease on his fingers?  Maybe he was just eager to get pulled from the game so he go outside Hohokam to get a pork tenderloin straight from the QC Area's own Chuck Cox and his Spring Training extension of TC's Food and Spirits.<br />

<p>* With no cuts to the roster yet, that dugout was mighty crowded this afternoon.  I think I saw Doug Dascenso walking around in there.</p>
<p>* Soriano dove for a ball.  It wasn't pretty, but he left his feet in a way that didn't involve a hop.  I'm not getting my hopes up.  It just surprised me.</p>
<p>* It's hilarious that every time Starlin Castro is brought up by someone in the Cubs organization, they hint at a future Theriot injury.&nbsp; Today it was Jim Hendry on the radio with Pat and Ron.&nbsp; If you haven't heard, Ron lost a tooth eating cheese pizza today.</p>
<p>* No Pepsi "Bizzay" commercials this year?  Maybe they aired it and I just missed it.  For you Quad Cities folks, television isn't the only place to hear commercials repeated several times in a broadcast.  Anyone that listens to Pat and Ron on KJOC 1170am is very familiar with the Lions Den Adult Superstore due to their 15 ads per Cubs game.  Anyway, I'm sure you'd like to see this commercial again:</p>

<p>WGN aired this commercial during the broadcast.  Will this be the commercial that makes me want to punch people by mid-April?</p>
