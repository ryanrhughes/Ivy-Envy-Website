<p>Kris Bryant&hellip;folks!  The Cubs called Kris Bryant up right at the deadline to hold the extra year of control and Wrigley Field was buzzing this weekend.  Bryant looked out-matched in his first game and then recovered in his second game by seeing a lot of pitches, working counts and ultimately taking walks.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about the Kris Bryant call-up, including the timing and the causes that led to it happening when it did.  We also discuss what this means for the 2015 season.  At the end of series with the Padres, the Cubs sit a game over .500 and the line-up looks pretty nice.  What will the rest of the season look like?</p>
<p>Addison Russell is next in line and we walk about how he&rsquo;s doing in Iowa and when we might see him in Chicago.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are facing quite a few injuries right now and it&rsquo;s having a pretty big impact on the team, specifically the bullpen.  We comment on this last week in Cubs baseball.  </p>
<p>We answer a listener question, read some internet muscle flexes and Kurt gives us a Scary Stat of the Week. </p>
