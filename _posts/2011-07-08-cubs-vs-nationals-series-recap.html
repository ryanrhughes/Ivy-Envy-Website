  content: We heard Bob at the same point in the game.  He was rolling his eyes so
    much you could almost hear it over the audio.  Thought he was going to knock over
    his mike and storm out of the booth.

<p><strong>The Cubs ended the series 36-53.<br />
The Nationals ended the series 45-45.</strong></p>
<p>This was going to be a tough series from the start. Ryan Dempster and Carlos Zambrano would both miss their starts leaving the job to Casey Coleman, Ramon Ortiz, a shaky Randy Wells and Matt Garza, who was coming off his best start of the year. At least we had one healthy guy who's made more than 10 starts this season. Garza would end up following the best start of the season with the worst. As usual, the Cubs got a lot of pretty good individual performances in this series, but no strong team effort until the last 3 innings of the last game.</p>

<p>WP Rodriguez, LP Mateo</p>
<p>Casey Coleman may have to go on the DL with permanent jet lag. He was called up for the third third time in three months on Monday to make the start for the injured Ryan Dempster. Coleman would return to Iowa on Tuesday, July 5. Happy 4th of July, Casey and happy birthday (his 24th on Sunday). He gave the Cubs 5.1 innings with 5 K and would leave the game with the Cubs leading 4-2. Then the bullpen parade began. Samardzija, Marshall, Wood, Russell, Mateo, Marmol. Not the best way to start a series on the road with your top two starters out. As for Coleman, if he is going to be a part of this team in the future, the Cubs aren't doing him any favors in the player development department. Being shipped around every couple weeks has got to be tough for a starting pitcher.</p>
<p>The Nationals would tie the game in the 7th and the Cubs would not score again. Quade was forced to use Marmol in the 10th when Marcos Mateo had to leave with some discomfort. Marmol would inherit Jayson Werth at second. Werth was sacrificed to second by pinch-hitting-pitcher, Livan Hernandez. Werth stole third on Marmol's first pitch. His 2-2 wild slider would get past Soto allowing Werth to score easily. Game over.</p>
<p>The 10th inning was a clinic in how to lose in extra innings. Here's how to do it. Walk the lead off man who happens to hitting .218. After the runner is sac'd to 2nd, forget he's even there and allow him to steal third. That way, just about any ball in play could lose you the game. With one out in the inning ask your closer, with little control of his slider on this particular night and a history of throwing it in the dirt to throw sliders to another cold hitter, .214 hitting Pudge Rodriguez. Oops, wild pitch. Fail.</p>

<p>WP Detwiler, LP Ortiz, SV Storen</p>
<p>Before this game started I would have guessed it would have ended with 10+ combined runs. Ramon Ortiz making his first start for the Cubs and his first MLB appearance since May 2010 and Ross Detwiler making his first start of the season for the Nats. Ortiz had been pitching very well in Iowa and I've been surprised it's taken the Cubs this long to give him a shot. Pitching well in AAA is not a guarantee of major league success. We've seen guys get lit up as soon as they're called up. It looked that would be the case in the first when Ortiz gave up 3, but he would "settle down" as they say and not allow another. He would pitch 6 innings and only allow those three runs with 7 Ks.</p>
<p>Detwiler shut down the Cubs through 5 and was pulled in the 6th after giving up a two-run homer to Aramis Ramirez. Getting to the Nationals bullpen isn't really a good thing. Coffey (the chubby guy who sprints in from the bullpen), Burnett, Clippard and their nearly unhittable closer Drew Storen would finish it off for the Nats allowing just three hits in the last 3 innings.</p>
<p>This loss was on the offense. They had to know they would need to score some runs to help out Ortiz. 2 runs and 2-11 with RISP (0-9 without Ramirez's HR) would not be enough.</p>

<p>WP Mattheus, LP Wood, SV Storen</p>
<p>This one would turn out to be another frustrating one-run loss. Randy Wells vs. former Cubs starter Tom Gorzelanny. The Nationals racked up 13 hits, but would leave 11 on base and only get 5 runs. The Cubs were never out of this game. After the Nats hit two-run homers in the 1st and 5th, the Cubs would match them with two-run homers by Pena and Ramirez in the 2nd and 6th. The momentum seemed to be in their favor until the oddest suicide squeeze incident I have ever seen. With a poor bunting Wilson Ramos batting and the massive 230 lb. Michael Morse at third with one out the Nats attempted an improbable suicide squeeze. The only problem is that Ramos didn't get the memo and swung at the pitch, fouling it off with Morse just a few feet away. Morse appeared shaken, as anyone would be, with the thought of taking a line drive to the head at that distance. So, the element of surprise was gone, right? Not so. Two pitches later they would successfully execute the squeeze on a perfect bunt by Ramos. I'm going to call out Quade, Riggins and the entire coaching staff on this sequence. After the botched attempt, Kerry Wood never threw to third. I realize that the entire point of the squeeze is that it is unpredictable, but the Nats showed their hand. Give a couple lazy tosses to third to make sure they don't try it again. Make them think twice. They're clearly a little off attempting it with a catcher that sucks at bunting and a slow, giant first baseman. With no throws over and a perfect strike to Ramos they were able to make it happen just two pitches later.</p>

<p>WP Marshall, LP Rodriguez, SV Marmol</p>
<p>Wow. Where do I start with this game. I'll breeze through the first 5 innings by saying that this was probably the worst 5 innings of baseball the Cubs have played all year. After 5, down 8-0, 3 errors and Garza could only muster 2 innings when they needed him to go deep into the game. After Jeff Baker got thrown out at 2nd trying to stretch a single into a double on Rick Ankiel's cannon, Bob Brenly said "I don't even know what to say anymore, Len." Exactly what I was thinking. It looked liked the Cubs were about to lose their 4th straight.</p>
<p>Then came the 6th and the Cubs would bat around the order and pick up 6 runs. The best part is that all 6 runs came with two outs. This couldn't be the Cubs. Suddenly, they were back in it. In the 7th, Pena jacked his 19th HR with Ramirez on first to tie it 8-8. I was still pissed about the first 5 innings and my emotions were all over the place. Castro would score in the 8th to make it 9-8, but the Nats wouldn't go away and tied it in the bottom of the inning. Ahhh! The thoughts of what I would write if they lost this game after all this were racing through my head. The Cubs would get the win after a clutch double in the ninth by Darwin Barney to score Tony Campana from second. Barney finished 3-5 with 3 RBI. All 3 RBI coming with 2 outs and men in scoring position.</p>
<p>Time for another Quade call out. Soto led off the ninth with a single to put the Cubs in a good position to score. With Campana available and your catcher at first with no outs the obvious move to me is that Campana would pinch run for Soto. Done deal in my head. The decision that WAS made was to leave Soto at first and have Byrd attempt to sac bunt Soto to second. Campana would follow in the pitcher's spot. WHAAAAT! The result. Byrd bunts and the 100 mph arm of Rodriguez throws out Soto at second. Now Byrd is at first with one out and Campana is at the plate. Hmmm. Campana nearly grounds into a double play, but beats it out. After all that, we're left with Campana at first with two outs. He steals second on the next pitch. Wouldn't it have been better to have Campana on second (assuming he steals) with no outs and Byrd attempting to advance him to third and Koyie Hill batting in the pitcher's spot. Just a thought. Luckily for Quade, Barney saved his ass with a double to score Campana and all is well that ends well, but that was a dumb set of moves.<br />
<strong>This was a frustrating series in a lot of ways.</strong> Three one run losses in a row and an absolutely crazy 4th game. Apparently the Nationals fans didn't have a lot of interest in seeing baseball this week. There were a ton of empty seats and a lot of Lexus logos visible on the seats behind the plate. Average attendance for the series was just over 23,000 and that's with over 32,000 on Monday. I guess I can't blame them for not wanting to watch one of the worst teams in baseball.</p>
