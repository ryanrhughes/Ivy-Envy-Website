<p>With the #6 pick in the first year player draft the Cubs have selected Albert Almora, OF, Mater Academy (Fla.).</p>
<p>This isn't a huge surprise as Almora has been projected to go to the Cubs by most mock drafts. The surprise is that Mark Appel from Stanford was still available at #6 and the Cubs chose to pass. He was drafted by the Pirates with the #8 pick. Appel was projected by many to be the #1 overall pick and is a college jr who would probably move his way through the minors quickly.</p>
<p>In other news, I just saw a commercial with Ron Swanson (<em>Parks and Rec</em>) wearing a Cubs hat and Daryl (<em>The Office</em>) wearing a White Sox. Love that Ron is a Cubs fan.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of attention put on what Epstein, Hoyer and Mcleod would do in their first draft with the Cubs. We have some waiting to do to see what comes of this draft class, but stay tuned for a full recap and analysis of the Cubs' 2012 draft.</p>
