    right, they are very vague when it comes to describing injuries.  \r\n\r\nDid

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Campana.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5290" title="Campana" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Campana.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="237" /></a></p><br />
So, here's my entire post in one sentence. Andrew Cashner won't be back any time soon after finding out he's re-aggravated&nbsp;his shoulder while Tyler Colvin and Marcos Mateo have been optioned to Iowa making room for tiny Tony Campana and lefty John Maine.</p>
<p>Now, the details if you want them.</p>
<p>Cashner had an MRI on Tuesday that confirmed the aggravation of his rotator cuff injury. MLB teams are really good at coming up with vague terms to describe injuries. Aggravation could mean anything from a minor sun burn to an arm completely falling off. The Cubs have not set a date for his return so I'm guessing it's somewhere between those two levels of severity. Other sources are saying July, but we'll see.</p>
<p>According to Jim Hendry, Tyler Colvin&nbsp;"...put himself in this spot". He's been optioned to Iowa after hitting .113 in 28 games. The Cubs are looking for the Colvin that showed up last year and hit 20 home runs and had 56 RBI.</p>
<p>The mighty Tony Campana made his major league debut last night vs. the Reds. After getting his three-sizes-too-big jersey from the Cubs equipment staff, the Cincinatti area native got to impress his family and friends with a pinch run scored, his first hit and an RBI. Campana is listed a 5' 8" 165 lbs, but looked like a third grader standing next to 6' 3" Joey Votto at first. Campana has been hitting .342 this year in Iowa and had a season average of .319 last year with Daytona. Don't expect any home runs to right from this lefty. Campana has never hit one in his professional career. Do expect pinch runs and stolen bases. He's fast. He had 66 steals in 2009. The top base stealer for the Cubs so far is Starlin Castro with 4. Tony already had 8 with Iowa.</p>
<p>Marcos Mateo has been streaky. He left with a 5.74 ERA in 20 appearances. Hendry has determined that Maine will be a better option in the bullpen based on his performance with the Cubs last year. Maine adds another lefty to the pen bringing the total to four now that James Russell has returned to his regular job.</p>
<p><strong>CONGRATULATIONS DOUG DAVIS. </strong>After his first start with the Cubs on Saturday, Davis' wife went in to labor and gave birth to their daughter on Sunday. Davis is scheduled to start Sunday at Fenway.</p>
