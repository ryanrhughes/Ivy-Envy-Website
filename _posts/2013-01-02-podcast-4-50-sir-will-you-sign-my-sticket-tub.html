<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt return after a week off to talk about two signings that the Cubs have made.  Edwin Jackson is the biggest free agent the Cubs have signed in the off-season.  Edwin Jackson's 4-year, $52 million signing was made official today.  We talk about the length and dollar amount of contract and we end up noticing the rankings of the Cubs players in regards to salaries.</p>
<p>The Cubs have also reportedly agreed to terms with Carlos Villanueva.  We discuss his starting and bullpen experience and assume that he will be given a chance to fight with Scott Baker, Scott Feldman and Travis Wood for a back-end of the rotation spot.  </p>
<p>We had a few listener-submitted topic suggestions from our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>.  Adam asks us about rooting for the Packers to help the Bears get in the playoffs.  Jake asks what the perfect item to have autographed at Cubs Convention would be.  Also, congrats to Brian for winning our Fantasy Football league this year.  </p>
<p>We give a few Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
