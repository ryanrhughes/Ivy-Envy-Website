<p>Don't forget that the live broadcast for our 100th podcast episode is tomorrow (Saturday) night at 7pm CST.  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6062" target="_blank">I mentioned before</a> that we are giving away the little girls Cubs dress and hair-bow. </p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2011/08/286742_10150255191808947_298438948946_7722573_7941630_o.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/286742_10150255191808947_298438948946_7722573_7941630_o-300x199.jpg" alt="" title="286742_10150255191808947_298438948946_7722573_7941630_o" width="215" height="145" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6089" /></a><a href="/uploads/2011/08/Cubs-Bow-300x1991.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/Cubs-Bow-300x1991.jpg" alt="" title="Cubs-Bow-300x199" width="215" height="145" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6090" /></a><br />

Thank you to <a href="http://www.markandgracie.com" target="_blank">Mark and Gracie's</a> for donating the dress and bow. You can put your name in to win this package at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a>.  Just find the post and add a comment to add your name to the drawing.  </p>
<p>We also have a few other things to give away.  In order to get your name in the drawing for these prizes, you must call in to the live show.  At the end of the show, we'll take all the names of the callers and choose winners for these three prizes.</p>
<p>*  <a href="http://www.flspringtraining.com" target="_blank">FLSpringTraining.com</a> has donated this game-used bat that is signed by 11 members of the Daytona Cubs.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/08/Daytona-Cubs-signed-bat.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/Daytona-Cubs-signed-bat-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="Daytona Cubs signed bat" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6085" /></a></center></p>
<p>It is signed by: Justin Bour, Rubi Silva, Jae-Hoon Ha, Evan Crawford, Logan Watkins, Rafael Valdes, Jake Ortiz, Matthew Cerda, Michael Brenly, Michael Burgess, David Macias.</p>
<p>*  The Peoria Chiefs have donated a Matt Szczur signed baseball.  Szczur started the season with the Chiefs and was then promoted to Daytona.  He is ranked as the #7 top Cubs prospect, but that was put out by Baseball America in January and he has shown quite a bit so I would have to think he'll be ranked much higher when the 2012 rankings come out.  Baseball America also crowned Szczur as the "Fastest Baserunner" and "Best Athlete" in the Cubs system.  I'm sure Tony Campana would have something to say about that "Fastest Baserunner" thing.  </p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/08/Matt-Szczur-signed-ball.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/Matt-Szczur-signed-ball-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="Matt Szczur signed ball" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6086" /></a></center></p>
<p>All signs indicate that Szczur is the Cubs' future center-fielder, so this is your chance to win a ball signed early in his career.  </p>
<p>*  The fine folks over at <a href="http://www.chitownclothing.com" target="_blank">ChiTown Clothing</a> have donated a shirt from their catalog.  If you are chosen as the winner for the ChiTown Clothing shirt, you can go to their website and choose any t-shirt design you'd like.  Here are a few of your options.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Ron.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Ron-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="ChiTown Ron" width="140" height="140" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-6071" /></a><a href="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Starlin.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Starlin-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="ChiTown Starlin" width="140" height="140" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-6072" /></a><a href="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Fool.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/08/ChiTown-Fool-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="ChiTown Fool" width="140" height="140" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6076" /></a><br />
<br><br></p>
<p>To be eligible to win the bat signed by Daytona Cubs players, the Matt Szczur signed baseball or the t-shirt from ChiTown clothing, you must call into the show.  We've done 100 episodes, you can call in and tell us what you think about the current and future Cubs.  Call in, say "hi" and have a chance to win one of these prizes.  </p>
