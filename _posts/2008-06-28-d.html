    Perhaps winning has come too easy for this team and they  need a stretch of bad baseball to show them that they are not invincible and destined to win the division, the pennent and end the 100 year drought.

    Guys like E-Pat should be playing their asses off.  You just got called up to the big leagues by the team with the best record in baseball and you're not going to give it your all to earn your spot onto the late season 40 man roster...or work your way into a trade with a team that could give you a starting spot.

    I didn't like him before, but now I think he is worthless and lazy.  He should never wear a Chicago Cubs uniform again.  Murton in Left!  I can't see him playing lazy like that.

<p>is playing a position with which he isn't very familiar, but he needs to at least hustle.&nbsp; The defense bears the same burden of placing the pitcher in a position to win that the offense does.&nbsp; The Cubs are 1-3 in the last four games, and the only errorless game out of those four was the lone win against the Orioles.&nbsp; Do the Cubs fielders need to run a bunch of little league drills where they "see the ball into the glove?"&nbsp; Not necessarily.&nbsp; However, they do have to be intentional about playing focused baseball every day.</p>
