<p>Andy and Corey look ahead to the trading deadline and discuss the moves that the Cubs could make and the idea of re-building. We also continue the discussion the situations with Hendry and Quade.</p>
<p>Mike Quade calls out Starlin Castro and Darwin Barney for their miscommunication in the infield and we tell you whether we agree with this action or not. We touch on a few topics that were given to us by listeners and we pick a photo caption winner.</p>
<p>Be on the look-out for an interview with Tim Sheridan. That should be up on Wednesday and he'll be sharing information on a project he's working on.</p>
<p>Corey will have the opportunity to meet Tom Ricketts and participate in a media session with the Cubs' Chairman. We know you have lots of questions for Ricketts and we want to hear them. Be on the lookout for a thread on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> early next week. Or, you can email them to me and we'll read them all on the next podcast episode.</p>
