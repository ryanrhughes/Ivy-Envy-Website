  content: The good news for Wells is he gets to come back up to the big show again
    and get a shot to prove that he's worthy of being back there.&nbsp; The bad news
    is, I'm sure the second Dempster's better, he'll be sent packing again.&nbsp;
    But I'm sure he's well aware of that.&nbsp; The only exception would have to be
    if he gets all Phil Humber on somebody, but even then I don't know.&nbsp;

<p>Ryan Dempster was placed on the Disabled List with a strained muscle and Randy Wells was recalled from Iowa to fill in for Dempster.  I was surprised when Wells was sent to Iowa, but had a hunch it wouldn't be long until the Cubs had an injured starter, paving the way for his return. </p>
<p>How did Wells do in his short time with Iowa?  The good news - he had a 1-0 record.  The bad news?  In the three games he started for the I-Cubs, he had a 9.42 ERA.  In his 14 innings pitched, he gave up 15 runs, all of them earned.  His last start was his worst performance, a 2.1 inning outing against Round Rock in which he gave up 8 runs on 8 hits.  </p>
<p>But Wells <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/12050301-573/veteran-randy-wells-back-in-cubs-rotation-replacing-injured-ryan-dempster.html" target="_blank">is not worried</a>.  Although have you really ever heard an athlete admit they are worried?  "I feel real good. The ball&rsquo;s coming off my hand good.  I know the ERA doesn&rsquo;t quite show it, but I&rsquo;ve worked out some stuff."</p>
<p>It would have been nice if Wells went down to Iowa and dominated AAA during his time there, but the Cubs need a starter and he's the best they have in the reserve tank.  We had hoped that Iowa would be a little stronger with pitching this year, especially starting pitching, but that's not really the case.  Check out their pitching stats <a href="http://www.milb.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?t=t_ibp&cid=451&stn=true&sid=t451" target="_blank">here</a>.  </p>
<p>Wells will have at least a few starts to redeem himself and try make the case for him to be kept on the Cubs and one of the struggling back-end starting pitchers to get the I-80 trip back to Des Moines.  </p>
