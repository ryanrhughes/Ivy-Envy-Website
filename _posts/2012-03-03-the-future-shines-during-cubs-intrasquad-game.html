<p>The Cubs left Fitch Park for Hohokam and the Spring Training schedule.  Before the Cubs start exhibition play on Sunday vs. Oakland, they are conducting two intrasquad games at Hohokam.  The players were split into basically an A Team (the Cubs of the present) and a B team (the Cubs of the future).  The Cubs of the future seized the opportunity and made those of us that have put our hopes in the minor league players look like we know what we're talking about...for a day, at least.  </p>
<p>Brett Jackson will probably not break camp with the Cubs, but we should see him occupying an outfield spot in front of the ivy sometime this year.  Jackson led the game off with a home run and ended the game 2-2 with two walks, two RBIs, two runs scored and the HR.  </p>
<p>Travis Wood, who came from the Reds in the Sean Marshall trade, served up that home run to Jackson and didn't pitch particularly well.  He gave up six runs in three innings.  Jackson wasn't the only prospect that had Wood's number on Friday.  Matt Szczur, the former Villanova wide receiver, took Wood deep for a grand slam.  </p>
<p>While the intrasquad game was not broadcast, I'm guessing the grand slam was not the most impressive play from Szczur to see.  He also scored from 2nd on a sacrifice fly to right fielder David DeJesus.  This is the type of heads-up and aggressive play that excites me about Szczur.  I saw him play early in the 2011 season with the Peoria Chiefs and witnessed him turn a routine base-hit to the left fielder into a double without even glancing at left field.  </p>
<p>For those that see Tony Campana as the lone speed threat, Szczur possesses the speed to be ranked the Fastest Baserunner and Best Athlete by <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/today/prospects/rankings/organization-top-10-prospects/2012/2612580.html" target="_blank">Jim Callis at Baseball America</a>.  While he's not anywhere close to being considered a "power-hitter", he definitely has more power than Campana.  In 2011, between Peoria and Daytona, Szczur had 10 home runs.  </p>
<p>While Brett Jackson is waiting in the wings and probably major league-ready, Szczur is a few years away.  After shining with Peoria and making the Midwest League All-Star Game, Szczur struggled a bit in Daytona.  I have not heard anything about where Szczur may start the 2012 season, but perhaps with a strong showing in Mesa this spring, Szczur could start things off in Tennessee.  </p>
<p>While Friday's game was merely a scrimmage, many Cubs fans were hoping to see the "B squad" stick it to big leaguers.  It's easier to have hope about the future than to face the possibility that the young guys have less promise than the current players we are ready to rid ourselves of.  At least for one day, we can see some hope on the horizon in Brett Jackson and Matt Szczur occupying two spots of the outfield in Wrigley.  </p>
