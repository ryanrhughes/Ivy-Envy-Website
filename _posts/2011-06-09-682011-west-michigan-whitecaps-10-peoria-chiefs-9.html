<p>I have been to O'Brien Field when players with MLB experience have been playing with the team.  On Tuesday, Angel Guzman was added to the Peoria roster from Extended Spring Training.  It's possible that many casual fans wouldn't recognize his name, especially if they have a short memory.  Guzman sat out the entire 2010 season after undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.  This is Guzman's fourth trip to Peoria.  He made two rehab starts for the Chiefs in 2005 and one in 2009.  </p>
<p>I made the 180 mile round-trip jaunt to Peoria on Wednesday night.  Guzman is not scheduled to pitch until Friday, but I thought this might be a good opportunity to watch Graham Hicks pitch.  Hicks came to the Cubs from the Nationals in the Tom Gorzelanny trade, which took place this last January.  Hicks appeared in his 10th game this season for the Chiefs.  He came into the game with a 1-2 record and a 2.33 ERA in 38.2 innings pitched.  Opponents were batting .244 against Hicks and he's pitched well against lefties, holding them to a .217 average. </p>
<p>The Chiefs hosted the West Michigan Whitecaps in the only series in which the two teams will face each other.  The Whitecaps are the Detroit Tigers affiliate in the Midwest League.  The Chiefs carried a 30-28 record into the game while the Whitecaps sported a record of 25-33.  With the 93 degree temperature reading at the first pitch, a healthy amount of offense was expected for the 1,802 in attendance at O'Brien Field. </p>
<p>Hicks is tall and lanky.  His 6'5"-185lb frame, along with his wind-up are reminiscent of Sean Marshall.  While Hicks has pitched pretty well this year, he struggled in this game against West Michigan.  The Whitecaps jumped to a 2-0 lead in the top of the 1st inning when Hernan Perez singled with one out and then Rob Brantly followed him with a two-run homerun off the picnic tables beyond the right-field wall.  </p>
<p>Hicks was taken deep again in the 4th, this time by the Whitecaps DH Billy Nowlin.  However, it was the 5th inning where things really fell apart for Graham Hicks.  The inning started off with an error by Chiefs shortstop David Macias off the bat of Luis Castillo.  After a barrage of four hits and another error, the Whitecaps scored four runs, two of them earned.  Hicks exited the game with the Chiefs down 7-5 after the top of the 5th and was replaced by the South Korean, Su-Min Jung.  </p>
<p>The Chiefs offense scored three runs in the bottom of the inning, and that gave Hicks the opportunity to get the win, despite the rough outing.  Hicks gave up seven runs, five of them earned, on nine hits in his five innings of work.  He struck out three and did not issue a walk.  Jung pitched two hitless innings, but Bryce Shafer came in to pitch the 8th for the Chiefs and the Whitecaps tied the game at nine, to give Hicks the no-decision.  </p>
<p>Offensively, the bats were alive for the Chiefs' offense.  The DH, Richard Jones, was the only Chiefs batter that did not register a hit.  Matt Szczur had a career-high four RBIs and went 4-5, extending his hitting streak to 11 games.  Sczcur was also able to show off some his his defensive skills and his speed in this game.  He's an exciting kid to watch and a name in the organization to keep an eye on.  </p>
<p>Kyung-Min Na also had a great game at the plate.  Na went 4-4 with two doubles, an RBI and one run scored.  Na is also a speedster and was named the fastest high school player in South Korea by scouts in 2009.  Na is a lefty and reminded me of a smaller, faster Kosuke Fukudome with a less exaggerated corkscrew swing.  He has just enough of that corkscrew swing to be very quick out of the batter's box and when a batter is making contact, it doesn't look as bad.  Na was picked off first base in the 8th, so while he's very quick, it appears that the 20 year old still has some fundamentals to work on.  </p>
<p>The game was tied at nine in the top of the 9th inning when Billy Nowlin hit his 2nd solo-homerun of the day, putting the Whitecaps up 10-9.  The Chiefs were not able to respond in the bottom half of the inning and dropped to 30-29 on the season. The Chiefs' pitching struggles continue as the staff blew it's fifth save in eight games.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, the Chiefs will host South Bend.  Former Cub and Hall-of-Famer Andre Dawson will be on hand to throw out the first pitch and sign autographs for charity.  We gave a pair of tickets away to Saturday's game and congratulations to Greg from New Windsor, IL for winning them.  If you haven't had the opportunity to see the Peoria Chiefs this year, they are a fun team to watch.  There's some speed, some power and some prospects worth keeping an eye on...and that's exactly what you'd want in a minor league team.  For those of you that are here in the Quad Cities, the Chiefs will be in town next weekend to take on the River Bandits.  If you get a chance, head down to Modern Woodmen and cheer on the future Cubs.  </p>
