<p>This episode contains an interview with Tim Sheridan of <a href="http://boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a> on the 2013 Cubs Spring Training.  But first, Andy, Corey and Kurt say farewell to Tony Campana and look at the two 17-year old pitchers the Cubs got in the trade with Arizona.  </p>
<p>We had a good discussion on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> yesterday about the Cubs potentially parting ways with WGN after the 2014 season.  Traditions are a tough thing for Cubs fans to ignore and WGN has been a part of the Cubs brand since 1948.  There are many aspects of the situation to consider.  There's also many dollars to consider.  Those are dollars that could make the Cubs quite competitive.   </p>
<p>We then play an interview we did with Tim Sheridan, the PA announcer at Hohokam and the man behind <a href="http://boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>. Tim's Spring Training coverage is second to none in my opinion.  He posts great photos and videos, and has the passion of a true fan.  Tim tells us what he's seen there at Fitch Park here in the first few weeks of Spring Training.  Tim talks about the progress of the organization in adopting "The Cubs Way".  </p>
<p>There's obviously a lot of prospect talk, since that's the emphasis of the organization.  Tim also comments on the mood of the fans at Fitch.  The construction of the new facility in Mesa is underway and Tim touches on that, too.  </p>
<p>We come back from the break and look at a couple of Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
