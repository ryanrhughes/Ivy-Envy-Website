<p>The 2012 season ended seven weeks ago and we've been fairly quiet on the website, besides our weekly podcast episodes.  If you have mentally put the the Cubs on the back-burner, allow me to get you up to speed with what has transpired so far in this off-season. </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Darwin-Barney.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Darwin-Barney-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Darwin Barney" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7910" /></a></a><strong><u><center>Darwin Barney Wins Gold Glove</strong></u></center>In a season in which Barney tied the MLB record for most consecutive errorless games at 2nd base (141), the choice for the Gold Glove for 2nd base in the NL was pretty clear.  In a season with very few bright spots, it was great to see Barney's work pay off and for him to win this award. </p>
<p>It's pretty incredible to see a player earn a spot on the roster in Spring Training and win something as prestigious as a Gold Glove the next season.  It will be interesting to see if Barney can maintain this productivity on defense.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Marmol.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Marmol-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Marmol" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7944" /></a><strong><center><u>Cubs Almost Trade Carlos Marmol</center></strong></u>Twitter blew up on Friday, November 2nd that the Cubs had traded Carlos Marmol to the Angels for Dan Haren.  The Cubs reportedly backed out of the trade because of concerns with Haren's health.  After the failed trade, the Angels quickly bought out Haren's option, making him a free agent.  </p>
<p>The would-be move was a little surprising, considering how dominant of a closer Marmol was just a few years ago.  However, Marmol is no longer that dominant closer and he may never be again.  From the Cubs perspective, a starter is more of a need than a closer.  Even if Marmol could become that dominant closer again, what's the point if the short-term plan for the organization is to assemble and develop rather than necessarily win games in 2013?  This is a pretty good sign that Marmol isn't in the long-term plans for the Cubs and could very possibly be dealt for a starter.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Volstad.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Volstad-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="San Fransico Giants v Chicago Cubs" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7923" /></a> <center><strong><u>Chris Volstad Era Is Over</strong></u></center>Chris Volstad came to the Cubs in the trade that sent Carlos Zambrano to the Marlins.  If the goal was to rid the organization of Zambrano, there wasn't much to lose in the trade.  However, Volstad gave us Cubs fans all the losing we could handle.  </p>
<p>Volstad started the season in the rotation and didn't earn his first win until his 14th start.  He finished the season with a 3-12 record and a 6.31 ERA.  He also started 12 games for the AAA Iowa Cubs, going 3-5 with a 5.17 ERA.  The Royals claimed Volstad off waivers and the future isn't bright for the former 1st rounder.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Baez.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Baez-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Baez" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7932" /></a><center><strong><u>AFL Season Ends Early for Javier Baez</strong></u></center>The Cubs' #1 pick in the 2011 draft (9th overall) was swinging away with the Mesa Solar Sox until he fractured his thumb.  This reportedly happened in a celebratory high-five with a teammate.  It was a non-displaced fracture on the tip of his right thumb.  This is not a serious injury and Baez will be ready for Spring Training.  I would imagine players are pulled from off-season fall and winter leagues with nearly any injury, as it is not worth the risk.  </p>
<p>In the 14 games before his injury, Baez was a heavy hitter, when he connected.  Baez was leading the league in HRs (4) and RBIs (16) at the time of his departure.  However he was hitting only .211 and had struck out 14 times while only drawing two walks.  Baez spent 23 games at High-A Daytona and struggled, after knocking the ball all over the Midwest League with the Peoria Chiefs.  I expect Baez to start the 2013 season in Daytona. </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Zack-Putnam.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Zack-Putnam-150x150.png" alt="" title="Zack Putnam" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7947" /></a><center><strong><u>Cubs Claim RHP Zach Putnam Off Waivers</center></strong></u>The 25-year old was drafted in the 5th round in 2005 by the Indians and spent the 2012 season with the Rockies organization.  Putnam has just 10 games of MLB experience.  He's pitched out of the bullpen at the AAA-level and in 3 season has a 3.80 ERA, which makes him pretty damn good in the Cubs organization.  </p>
<p>Given how many pitchers the Cubs went through in 2012, Putnam will probably get plenty of playing time in the Majors in 2013.  I think we'll see the Cubs add quite a few more pitchers like this before April.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Scott-Baker.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Scott-Baker-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Minnesota Twins v Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7950" /></a><strong><u><center>Cubs Sign Starter Scott Baker</center></u></strong>The Cubs signed Baker to a $5.5 million, one-year deal to give them four starters for the rotation.  This is a very Paul Maholm-type deal.  Baker is a solid pitcher that could hold some value at the trade deadline.  Baker was the Twins Opening Day starter just a few years ago.  The 31-year old has a 63-48 record and a 4.15 ERA over his seven MLB seasons, all of which were with the Twins.  </p>
<p>Theo Epstein says the Cubs are pursuing pitchers across the spectrum, but they definitely seem to be keyed in on the players recovering from injuries.  Price tags are a little lower on these players and the risks aren't huge.  Is Baker in the long-term plans?  Probably not, but he can serve as a stop-gap in this "organizational assembly" time.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Matt_Garza_2012_Cubs.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Matt_Garza_2012_Cubs-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Matt_Garza_2012_Cubs" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7957" /></a><center><strong><u>Matt Garza Cleared to Pitch</strong></u></center>Garza injured his elbow on July 21st, right before the trade deadline.  That injury is probably the reason Garza is still with the Cubs.  Garza has been cleared to resume workouts and will reportedly be ready for Spring Training.  </p>
<p>Garza could be the Ace of this rotation the Cubs need him to be healthy and strong heading into Spring Training.  Perhaps they could spend a little more time working with him on fielding in Mesa.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dioner+Navarro+Los+Angeles+Dodgers+v+Cincinnati+F5GBOqN99Ggl.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Dioner+Navarro+Los+Angeles+Dodgers+v+Cincinnati+F5GBOqN99Ggl-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Dioner+Navarro+Los+Angeles+Dodgers+v+Cincinnati+F5GBOqN99Ggl" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7964" /></a><strong><center><u>Cubs Sign Catcher Dioner Navarro</strong></u></center>The 28-year old catcher signed a 1-year, $1.75 million deal.  Navarro has been moved around since being drafted in 2004.  He's been with the Yankees, Dodgers, Rays and Reds.    He is a career .245 hitter and has spent most of his career jumping between the majors and minors.  He's a better hitter than Steve Clevenger, so I'd expect Navarro to serve as Welington Castillo's back-up and Clevenger will be back in Iowa.  </p>
<p>Navarro has fought through a lot off the field.  Both is wife and mother have suffered from cerebral aneurysms.     His wife was given a 5% chance of surviving surgery, but made a full recovery.  His son was born with multicystic dysplastic kidney and had to have one of his kidneys removed.   </p>
<p>Navarro should make a solid back-up for Castillo and has some power that the Cubs could use off the bench.  </p>
