Just when we thought the Cubs might be done signing pitchers, they go and grab two more. &nbsp;This past week, the Cubs added Gerardo Concepcion and Ryan Rowland-Smith.</p>
<p>Concepcion, an 18-year-old Cuban defector, reportedly signed a seven million dollar contract with the Cubs. &nbsp;Signing a player as young as Concepcion to a contract that large shows that the Cubs see him as a pitcher with immense potential. &nbsp;The size of the contract might also be a result of the buzz surrounding Cuban players this off season. &nbsp;The Cubs have been reported to be very interested in both Yoenis Cespedes and Jorge Soler as well. &nbsp;Concepcion is a left-handed pitcher who was named Rookie of the Year in the&nbsp;Cuban Serie Nacional last season. &nbsp;He had great numbers in his one season there, and hopefully he adjusts well to the American game.</p>
<p>Australian pitcher Ryan Rowland-Smith, 29, &nbsp;has also been signed to a minor league contract. &nbsp;He has been with the Mariners for four seasons, and at one point he was among the top ten prospects in Seattle's organization. &nbsp;Rowland-Smith had a rough past couple seasons, and he spent last season on the roster of the Mariners' triple-A affiliate. &nbsp;According to his Twitter account (hyphen18), he is "stoked to be a CUB!!!"</p>
<p>It's great to see how much emphasis the Cubs are placing on pitching, and we have to believe that some of these players will end up being effective pieces of the big league club at some point. &nbsp;Others will likely be used in future trades. &nbsp;Good news either way.</p>
