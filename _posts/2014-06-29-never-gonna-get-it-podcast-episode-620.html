We talk a little about who is to credit for this "success", both offensively and pitching-wise.  Will this be the only month in the 2014 season that the Cubs play at or better than .500?</p>
<p>We spend some time looking at the Iowa Cubs roster, realizing this is by far the most exciting roster Iowa (or any Cubs minor league team) has had since we started our podcast in March of 2009.  In doing so, we look at who may be the first position prospect the Cubs call up to the big league team, Arismendy Alcantara.  </p>
<p>Dallas Beeler had a really nice MLB debut and we look at this game and discuss Theo's motivational approach to calling him up.  </p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener submitted questions, Corey steps on Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week and we award a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
