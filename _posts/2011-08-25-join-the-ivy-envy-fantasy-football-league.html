  content: I am willing to give this a shot this year.  The only thing is I know literally
    nothing about it.  Nothing.  So you guys might have to help me with it

<p>The Cubs have been out of it since...April and it's almost September.  Do you really want to think about Castro walking around the infield with his head in the clouds?  Do you want to sit and ponder why the Cubs maneuvered through the trade deadline with a guy guiding the ship that had already been secretly fired because he isn't worthy of the position?  It's just discouraging.  You know that we are months from finding out which direction Tom Ricketts are going to take this organization.  You can take some time off from the Cubs, as long as you read our site and listen to our podcast.  We've all been ready to find something else to pay attention to for months. </p>
<p>Now that football season is about to start, you actually have something worth-while to distract yourselves.  So why not join us in a Fantasy Football League?  Like everyone else, you probably do 5 different leagues, but what's one more?  No money, just fun.  </p>
