<p>With the Cubs half way through their four-game series with the Milwaukee Brewers, the Cubs have worked through one cycle of their starting rotation.  For the most part, Cubs fans can't be disappointed with the rotation.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Ryan Dempster 7.2IP 2H 1 R 1ER 3BB 10K</strong></u><br />
Dempster's Opening Day performance was a thing of beauty.  We all know that Dempster probably wouldn't be a #1 on many other rosters, but on Thursday, he showed why he has earned that spot on this pitching staff.  He labored in the 1st inning and struggled in the 3rd inning.  In both innings, the Nationals had runners on 2nd and 3rd with 1 out, but failed to score.  </p>
<p>He was pulled by Sveum with 2 outs in the 8th inning after giving up just his 2nd base-hit of the game.  Kerry Wood eventually walked the run in, which was charged to Dempster, though hardly his fault.  After 108 pitches on a cool Opening Day, it's understandable why Sveum would pull him, but I think the W-flag would have been flying at Wrigley if Dempster would have finished the game, or at least the inning.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Matt Garza 6IP 5H 2R 2ER 1BB 5K</strong></u><br />
While Garza's line doesn't look that impressive, it was one fastball to Adam LaRoche that damaged his pitching line.  Garza left the game with the Cubs leading 4-2, but the bullpen paved the way for another no-decision for the starters.  </p>
<p>A 60-degree day is pretty warm for an April game at Wrigley and Garza, for the most part, did a good job of keeping the ball down.  Garza was hurt by the lack of Cubs offense last year and hopefully the bullpen doesn't continue to blow his leads this year.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Jeff Samardzija 8.2IP 4H 3R 1ER 0 BB 8K</u></strong><br />
Jeff Samardzija has been a joke for most Cubs fans.  Many scoffed at the idea of him being in the rotation, let alone the #3 starter.  Samardzija appeared to be on a mission to prove his worthiness.  Had Starlin Castro been able to accurately throw across the diamond, Samardzija would have completed the game.  With 2 outs in the top of the 9th, Castro's throwing error allowed Ryan Zimmerman to reach first safely.  Adam LaRoche then hit a home run off Samardzija and Sveum dipped into the bullpen to give Marmol his first save of the 2012 season.</p>
<p>Anyone that has paid attention to Ivy Envy for any amount of time knows that I'm probably the biggest Samardzija-homer in existence.  So I'll keep this to a minimum, but it's great to see Samardzija putting things together.  He was a guy the Cubs spent a good chunk of money on and has struggled in his time in the majors.  However, he pitched well last year and if Sunday's performance is a glimpse of what Samardzija can be for the Cubs, I have a feeling I won't be the only one proudly sporting my #29 shirt.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Chris Volstad 5IP 5H 3R 3ER 2BB 6K</u></strong><br />
Volstad's performance is something you'd probably expect from a #4 starter.  It took him a while to settle down and he threw a lot of pitches in those 5 innings of work.  I have pretty low expectations for the back end of the rotation, so I think the goal would be for them just to get into the 6th, maybe the 7th inning and keep the game close.  At the end of the 5th, the game was tied 3-3, so all I'd like from him is to go a little deeper in the game.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Paul Maholm 4IP 6H 6R 6ER 2BB 2K</strong></u><br />
I was real excited about the Cubs picking up Maholm in the off-season.  I enjoyed watching him pitch for the Pirates and hoped that the Cubs offense could score more runs for him than the Pirates did.  He was 6-14 with a 3.66 ERA last year.  </p>
<p>Paul Maholm will probably not look back fondly on his Cubs debut.  It's not good when you give up 2HRs at Wrigley when the temperature is in the 30s with a strong wind blowing in.  There were probably 3 or 4 flyouts that probably would have cleared the fence on a warm day.  </p>
<p>I couldn't figure out why Maholm was assigned the #5 spot, but I now have a better understanding.  I'm guessing Maholm is going to put this game behind him and I will, too.  Len and Bob noticed that the Brewers may have spotted something in his delivery, identifying his off-speed pitches.  Perhaps the Cubs will identify the issues by looking at tape and get Maholm on track.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Summary</strong></u><br />
The top three starters in the rotation each earned quality starts.  The back end of the rotation showed some weakness, but that's to be expected.  If the front of the rotation can perform well on a consistent basis, that will allow the Cubs to focus on finding the right pieces for the #4 and #5 spots.  Whether that's Volstad, Maholm, Randy Wells or someone else, that will probably become more clear over the next 3-4 starts.  </p>
