On this, the 398<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we try to reassure you that the Cubs are just fine.  Their 25-8 record should have already done it, but some folks need a little more reassurance.  We discuss what we right and what went wrong in this 3 game series with the Padres.</p>
<p>With a shutout in the 2nd game of the doubleheader, a lot of focus is on Soler.  Soler went 0-4 with 4 strikeouts in the game.  We weigh in on the Soler issue and share what we think might be wrong.  </p>
<p>We share some scary stats and Andy spins a wonderful Rube Waddell story.  </p>
