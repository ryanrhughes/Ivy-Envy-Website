excerpt: "I believe I have written before that the idea that \"This series is important\"
  or \"This game is important\" is kind of a silly notion.&nbsp; There are 162 games
  and though the idea is to just win series', there are numerous opportunities to
  make up lost ground.&nbsp; That said...this series is important.\n\nI don't think
  it's terribly important numbers-wise, although the Cubs and Brewers were close enough
  last year for it to scare me.&nbsp; If a few games would have gone the other way,
  the Cubs wouldn't have enjoyed getting destroyed by the Arizona in the playoffs.&nbsp;
  This series feels important because it has the potential to be a momentum-builder,
  especially for the Cubs.&nbsp; I would think it would be kind of deflating for the
  Brewers "

<p>I believe I have written before that the idea that "This series is important" or "This game is important" is kind of a silly notion.&nbsp; There are 162 games and though the idea is to just win series', there are numerous opportunities to make up lost ground.&nbsp; That said...this series is important.</p>
<p>I don't think it's terribly important numbers-wise, although the Cubs and Brewers were close enough last year for it to scare me.&nbsp; If a few games would have gone the other way, the Cubs wouldn't have enjoyed getting destroyed by the Arizona in the playoffs.&nbsp; This series feels important because it has the potential to be a momentum-builder, especially for the Cubs.&nbsp; I would think it would be kind of deflating for the Brewers <a id="more"></a><a id="more-161"></a>if the Cubs strolled into Wrigley-North (Miller Park) and not only won the series, but also beat CC Sabathia and Ben Sheets.&nbsp; The Cubs managed to keep the game close&nbsp; against Sabathia and get into the Brewers bullpen.&nbsp; The key to beating the Brewers is to get to their bullpen.&nbsp; Tonight, Zambrano faces Sheets and Carlos loves these pressured situations.&nbsp; I expect him to give the Cubs a good chance to win.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the type of game that&nbsp;will be a low-scoring game that will probably come down to an error or some other flukey play.</p>
<p>I really do feel that the Brewers have more to lose in this series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Derek Lee escaped hitting into another double play after the error by Rickie Weeks.&nbsp; Lee has hit into 21 double plays already this year.&nbsp; That's 6 more than he had in all of the 2007 season.</p>
<p>* Marmol looked great last night.&nbsp; He was intense and masterful.&nbsp; It seemed he had much more control over his pitches and he made batters look silly.</p>
<p>* Samardzija has stepped up well.&nbsp; He looked a little shaky in his first appearance, but that's to be expected.&nbsp; He pitched a great two innings on Sunday and earned his first save.&nbsp; If you believe what Lou Piniella says, Samardzija won't necessarily be headed back to Iowa when Wood comes off the DL. "You see a young man throwing the ball like that, I don't think he'll be the guy leaving, I'll tell you that," Piniella said.&nbsp; I would say that he definitely helped shore up the bullpen and he's helped just as much as going out and getting someone at the trade deadline.&nbsp; Let's hope he can keep this up.&nbsp; I like what I see.</p>
