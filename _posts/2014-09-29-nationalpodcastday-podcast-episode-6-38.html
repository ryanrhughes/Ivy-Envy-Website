  content: If things go how I hope they will, I may be starting a podcast soon. I'm
    meeting to discuss it on Friday, so that's sort of a podcast celebration. Anyway,
    my podcast list is 99% Invisible, Cracked, Freakonomics, The Nerdist, Stuff You
    Should Know, Mohr Stories, Fatman on Batman, and of course, Ivy Envy. I listen
    to these religiously and would recommend them all.

    Great episode today, right up there with the season predict over under and end of season results. My list The Final  Lap(nascar), TWIT, Build a Bad Ass Business, a lot of Paleo diet podcasts, morningstar, Multirotor podcast, all of the Corolla digital series, Bigger Pockets, Timehackers, Mac Break, Mac Power Users, The Mutual Fund Show, and a couple conservative politics shows.
    The big ones that got me going are Dave Ramseys Entreleadership, 48days to the work you love, and This is Your Life by Michael Hyatt as I'm trying to work on my career

  content: I found Ivy Envy when ESPN cancelled their awesome Baseball Today with
    Eric Karabell and Keith Law and replaced it with the awful Baseball Tonight Podcast
    and I had a hole in my Baseball Podcast Lineup. On iTunes I found a number of
    individual team podcasts and subscribed to one for my Braves, the Nats, and Ivy
    Envy. After a half season of listening I had enough of Braves Talk and the Nats
    podcast but after two seasons I have yet to have my fill of Ivy Envy.                                                                                                 I
    also listen to Effectivly Wild, The Jonah Keri Podcast, ESPN's Fantasy Focus Baseball
    Podcast, Never Not Funny, Filmspotting, Happy Jack's RPG Podcast, and most of
    all Stop Podcasting Yourself.                                            I really
    enjoy listening to podcasts from various universities in the iTunes U area of
    iTunes.

    Jason missed AnteUp poker cast. Edumacation is also a good one when they bother
    to put them out.

  content: "Great episode! I got into podcasts through This American Life and then
    found out the plethora of niche options. It was like creating a radio station
    that only I wanted to listen to, but I don't have to worry about it getting cancelled
    or turned into a top 40 station. I listen to a lot the baseball podcasts you mentioned
    in the episode, but other big ones for me are The Pen Addict, The Lunch Box Podcast,
    The Dinner Party Download, How to Do Everything, The Incomparable, among others.
    I found Ivy Envy through my frustration with Bleacher Nation (nothing against
    those two guys, they're awesome, but the podcast was too sporadic and too deeply
    informed for my taste - haha). \n\nIvy Envy and The Pen Addict eventually pushed
    me into wanting to podcast myself. I started a podcast called The Erasable Podcast
    that focuses on a super-niche I love, wooden pencils and analog writing. My two
    co-hosts and I (one works in marketing in Fort Wayne, one is a stay at home dad
    and PhD in Baltimore, and I'm an 8th grade teacher in East TN - though my hometown
    is Munster, IN) record every other week. Within 15 episodes, we're up to 4-6,000
    downloads per episode. Last week we interviewed a Nat Geo television show host
    and before that the CEO of America's best pencil manufacturer. I also have a blog
    called The Writing Arsenal, but like you Corey, I sort of hate blogging. I'm in
    the process of phasing that burden out and sticking to the podcast. Every two
    weeks I'm itching to record and I can't imagine stopping. Thanks for the inspiration!
    I owe a lot of our style to listening to the relaxed tone of your podcast and
    I hope ours is a listenable as yours."

    until maybe six months ago.  Nick Seuberling does a podcast on the Cincy Bengals.  Jason
    Bryant runs a network of college wrestling podcasts.

  content: Wow. A Bengles podcast. One of the few that would have been more painful
    than the Cubs over the last decade.
