  content: "Corey I completely understand your viewpoint.  What irks me is how the
    Cubs pushed Samardzija up the system and onto the big league club seemingly based
    more on celebrity status then on actual ability shown in the minors.  Not to mention
    the RIDICULOUS contract Hendry gave him given his all-too-brief professional career
    at that point.  I know the contract is not so much Jeff's fault but one would
    hope he'd play up to that and frankly I haven't seen that.\r\n\r\nI'm tired of
    this season as well (hence the complete lack of any activity at EOC).  Hopefully
    2011 brings better times.  But with $103.5 million already committed to next year's
    payroll I'm not too optimistic they'll make many changes this offseason."

  content: Corey, it was not his first MLB start. I believe it was his third. I think
    his other 2 were both late season starts as well. He looked decent Monday night.
    Had more confidence in his breaking stuff. Maybe he's figured out major leaguers
    can hit even the best 4-seam fastball. Still needs to work on his control though,
    he was a bit wild.

<p>When the Cubs put Jeff Samardzija in the bullpen to start the 2010 season, I was pretty frustrated that the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2203" target="_blank">Cubs weren't giving him a chance to succeed</a> by giving him adequate time in the minor league system to develop his pitches.&nbsp; After a few weeks and four relief appearances in April, the Cubs moved Samardzija to Iowa.&nbsp; And the best part is - they left him there for the entire season.  Samardzija responded by going 11-3 for the Iowa Cubs this season.  </p>
<p>So when Samardzija was called up to the Cubs, I was real interested in seeing how he will perform to close out this 2010 season.&nbsp; Immediately, bloggers and fans poked fun at Samardzija and his past struggles.&nbsp; He's the new John Grabow...the easy guy to hate.&nbsp; People hate him for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; He hasn't played particularly well for the Cubs.&nbsp; He is highly paid and he has not earned the salary.&nbsp; However, it seems that the biggest beef people have with him is that he wore a gold helmet in college.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is probably the reason that I have continued to support Samardzija.&nbsp; I won't hide the fact I'm a Notre Dame homer and Samardzija has a special place in my heart.&nbsp; He earned that spot with plays like this, which I happened to be in Notre Dame Stadium for:</p>
<p><center><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="350" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/l_g3oLuVMt8&amp;feature" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/l_g3oLuVMt8&amp;feature"></embed></object></center></p>
<p>When I heard that Samardzija would be getting his first Major League start on Monday versus the Cardinals, I knew the blogs and Twitter-world would be licking their chops to make fun of him.&nbsp; I was happy to see him get a chance to start after spending a season in Iowa.&nbsp; The game didn't matter for either team, so why not give him an opportunity to start and face Major League batters for more than an inning of relief?</p>
<p>Samardzija responded by shutting the Cardinals out for 5 2/3 innings before being lifted.&nbsp; It wasn't a perfect performance.&nbsp; He gave up six hits and walked four, but he worked himself out of jams and looked better than he ever has in a Cubs uniform.  He also knocked in an RBI.  </p>
<p>So the purpose of this post isn't so much to celebrate a good outing by Jeff Samardzija, it's to complain about Cubs fans.&nbsp; I'm sick of all the negativity from Cubs bloggers and Twitter folks.&nbsp; I know there is a large number of Cubs fans that want to see Jeff Samardzija fail.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Is it because you turned on him quickly and want to be right in the long-run?  Or is it that you all wear your negativity towards the Cubs as a badge of honor?  It's lame, whatever it is.  </p>
<p>I am the first to admit that there have been Cubs players I haven't liked.&nbsp; We were called out for our "Most Hated Cub of the Year" contest at our event at Twenty last year.&nbsp; I can understand some frustration with the club and individual players.  But I'm a Cubs fan and I want to see anyone wearing Cubby blue succeed.&nbsp; I don't remember this negativity from fans in the 80's.&nbsp; We were Cubs fans and they were "our guys".&nbsp; I fault the explosion of the blogging world.&nbsp; Everyone has to out-do eachother and if you have nothing of substance to stand on, you apparently have to out-do others with the dislike of a player...or Manager...or General Manager.  It's over the top and it doesn't make you funny or witty.  </p>
<p>Honestly, I'm tired of it and I'm ready for this season to be done.</p>
