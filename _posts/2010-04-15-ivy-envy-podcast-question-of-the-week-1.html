<p>We will be introducing a new segment on the upcoming podcast episode.  We would like to interact with the listeners more and get your opinions on things.  So we will send out a question on Thursday or Friday of every week via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946?ref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.  So follow us there and join in the discussion.  We will read all responses on the podcast.  You can also respond by e-mailing us at:  podcast@ivyenvy.com</p>
<p>We wanted to keep it pretty simple for the first question and here it is:<br />
Who is your favorite Cubs player, past or present?  What did that player do to endear himself to you?</p>
