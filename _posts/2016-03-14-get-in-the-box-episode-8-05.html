  content: Guys don't get out of the box by defining the 91 year old as a republican
    and a trump supporter.It irrelevant, plus it makes you look stupid saying stuff
    like that! You only cause division in your followers and make some &nbsp;not want
    to become supporters of your broadcast. Stick to baseball!
