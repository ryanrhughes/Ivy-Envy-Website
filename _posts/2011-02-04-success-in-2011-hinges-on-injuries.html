<p>I realize that the title of this post is a bit of a cliche.&nbsp; That statement is true for every team in baseball.&nbsp; There are 2 or 3 players on every team that must, for the most part, stay healthy for the team to compete for their division title.&nbsp; The difference between that type of situation and the 2011 Cubs is if the Cubs stay healthy, they will MAYBE compete for the division.&nbsp; If they don't stay healthy, come September, they could easily be battling the Pirates to stay out of the cellar.</p>
<p>The Cubs are a much younger team than what we have seen for a number of years.  If injuries do happen (and they will), these young and inexperienced players will be called on to step up.  Over the next week or two, I will look at each position on the team and identify the weak spots in the line-up in regards to injuries and depth.</p>
