<p>After 5 months of waiting, our bus trip to the Cubs game is today.&nbsp; I'm pretty floored that 56 people will be making this trip today.&nbsp; I'm glad that we sold the tickets in February, when everyone was excited about the Cubs.&nbsp; If we would have waited until this point in the season, I'm not sure we could have given them away.&nbsp; It will be cool to see Derrek Lee one more time, though he'll be wearing different shades of blue and red.</p>
<p>But it's going to be a blast and we'll be posting some photos from the trip on Twitter today so follow along at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">www.twitter.com/ivyenvy </a></p>
<p>Get ahold of us on Twitter if you'll be at Wrigley today and want to get a drink.</p>
<p>Also, There won't be a podcast episode this week since we typically record on Saturday mornings.</p>
