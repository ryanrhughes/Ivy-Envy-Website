<p>The news just broke that Jim Hendry has been dismissed from his role as the General Manager of the Chicago Cubs.  Randy Bush will take over as the interim General Manager.  </p>
<p>For those of us that have expressed concern about the Ricketts family and their ability to make big moves to guide the team towards a future of winning, this is a good sign.  This was the first big step and I'm thrilled to see ownership make the move.  </p>
<p>Ricketts will address the media this morning and an early quote is that "It's time for a fresh approach in our baseball leadership".  </p>
