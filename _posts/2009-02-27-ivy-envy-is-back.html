<p>Welcome to the new home of Ivy Envy. Thanks for finding us and be sure to subscribe to or update the RSS feed so you can get all our posts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to let you in on some of the changes here at Ivy Envy. I know this happened towards the end of the 2008 season, but we have added Kurt as a writer. He&rsquo;s already chimed in with some good reads and we&rsquo;re glad to have him on board. Kurt&rsquo;s a graphic designer, so there have been whisperings of some Ivy Envy shirts.</p>
<p>The big news is that Ivy Envy will now host a podcast. We are recording our first episode this Saturday and it should be up by Sunday. We will record our second episode the weekend before Opening Day and once the season starts up, we aim to bring you a new episode once a week. The podcast will be available to stream or download on the site and it will also be in the iTunes store for free, of course. We have asked a local sports reporter, Matt Veto to join us with the podcast whenever he would like. Matt writes and blogs for the Dispatch/Argus and you can find his blog at: <a href="http://www.qconline.com/bloggers/vetopower/">Veto Power</a></p>
<p>One Ivy Envy writer will be making a trip to Spring Training.&nbsp; Paul heads to Mesa in a few weeks.&nbsp; I'm trying to encourage him to do some stuff for Ivy Envy while he's down there.&nbsp; I think it's only fair that he shares a little slice of Spring Training with those of us stuck in the frozen tundra.</p>
<p>Visit us regularly and if you like what you see, tell other Cubs fans. We&rsquo;re glad to be back on the horse and we will continue to be your source for strong opinions and marginal analysis of the Chicago Cubs.</p>
