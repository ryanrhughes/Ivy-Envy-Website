    to ask ?  The rest of the team can't continue to be held back by your  lack of

  content: Len and JD talked about this during the game last night. I don't remember
    the numbers, but they showed the run differential in wins and losses. When they
    win they win big. When they lose they don't score.

<p>A few years ago, we thought 2014 would be the year of the start of the upswing.  Here we sit almost halfway through May and other than some encouraging individual performances (Rizzo, Castro and some pitching) there hasn't been anything to indicate that upswing will happen this year.  But if you're looking for something to be encouraged by, trying looking at the Cubs run differential.  </p>
<p>Granted, these stats are a little distorted by last night's 17-5 blowout of the Cardinals, but they're still worth looking at.  </p>

<p>That's right, this Cubs team that is 13-25 (.351), which is the 2nd worst record in baseball, ranks 18th out of the 30 teams in run differential with a deficit of just -4.  With a run differential of -4, their record should theoretically be 18-19.  </p>
<p>The Cubs run differential ranks them 4th in the division, ahead of only Pittsburgh.  We're not talking about bad luck keeping the Cubs from being a playoff-caliber team. What we're talking about is that the Cubs would be more fun to watch if their record came close to mirroring their run differential. However, then we get into the discussion of what a .500 team in 2014 does for the long-term trajectory of the organization.  </p>
<p>I would like this year to be the last that I say, "We'll get a good draft pick next year."  Would you rather see the team hover around .500 and have no real shot at the playoffs, or secure a top 3 draft pick and get a player like...oh, Kris Bryant?</p>
