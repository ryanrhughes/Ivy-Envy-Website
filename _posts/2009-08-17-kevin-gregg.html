  content: Well, at least Gregg is now out of the closer role.  This has been one
    area that really sets the Cardinals apart from the Cubs--Ryan Franklin has only
    blown two saves in 32 opportunities.  Can we fault the Cubs offense at all for
    not getting more runs on a team like the Padres?  It all looked so promising with
    TL on the mound.

  content: "It's not ideal to only give the closer a one run lead going into the 9th,
    but that dude gave up 4 runs.  So in theory, he would have given up a four run
    lead, which should be pretty safe.  The lack of offense is troubling, but a closer
    giving up 4 runs in the 9th is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nThat was the 11th homerun Gregg
    has given up this year."

  content: Yeah, you're right... I can understand the closer giving up one run every
    once in a while, but anything more than that is unacceptable for the guys that
    supposedly have the best stuff among relievers.  When Gregg blows a save, he goes
    all out.

<p>I shouldn't be writing this post.&nbsp; I stayed up late for this West Coast game simply because I wanted to hear the Cubs win a 1-0 game.&nbsp; It would have been the first of the season.&nbsp; Enter, Kevin Gregg.</p>
<p>Piece of shit.&nbsp; I beg someone to defend him.&nbsp; Give me one reason he should not be released tonight.&nbsp; If this photo doesn't make you swear, I want to hear from you.</p>

<p>Totally worthless post, but I feel that I'm entitled to it after what I had to endure tonight.</p>
