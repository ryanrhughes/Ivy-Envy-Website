  So the White Sox are headed to the North Side for the weekend's Crosstown Series.&nbsp; The Cubs come limping into Wrigley after getting swept for the first time this year....by the Tampa Rays.&nbsp; That just doesn't sound right.&nbsp;

  So maybe Lou will be looking to fire the team up.&nbsp; Maybe a guy in cubbie blue will step up and motivate his team

<p>So the White Sox are headed to the North Side for the weekend's Crosstown Series.&nbsp; The Cubs come limping into Wrigley after getting swept for the first time this year....by the Tampa Rays.&nbsp; That just doesn't sound right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe Lou will be looking to fire the team up.&nbsp; Maybe a guy in cubbie blue will step up and motivate his team<a id="more"></a><a id="more-101"></a>&nbsp;by knocking someone around a little.&nbsp; I'm not an advocate of violence, but Michael Barrett's punch to AJ Pierzynski was one of the best Cub moments in my life.&nbsp; This wasn't a scuffle, he decked Pierzynski.&nbsp; So which current Cub is the team badass?&nbsp; Who would be most likely to step up like Barrett did?&nbsp; Maybe the badass that took Barrett on in the dugout, Carlos Zambrano?&nbsp; Well, he isn't pitching in this series.&nbsp; Plus, he's nursing a shoulder.&nbsp; I think Derek Lee's punch on Chris Young last year was pretty weak and that seemed out of the ordinary for Lee.&nbsp; So I don't think it will be him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My pick is Geovany Soto.&nbsp; I mean, this current group of Cubs players don't look real tough.&nbsp; Mark Derosa and Mike Fontenot aren't exactly intimidating.&nbsp; But I wouldn't want to cross Soto.&nbsp; He's a catcher, so he's got to be tough and ready for some physical impact at all times.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://media.scout.com/Media/Image/42/429615.jpg" alt="Soto" /></p>
<p>He's a rookie and shooting for a starting bid on the NL All-Star team.&nbsp; So maybe this is his chance to step up and be&nbsp;a leader on this team.&nbsp; Again, I'm not advocating violence, but to quote the movie<em> </em>Rudy, "Nobody comes into our house and pushes us around".&nbsp; Maybe the Cubs just aren't feared enough yet.&nbsp; Whether it's with runs, attitude&nbsp;or fists, I think the Cubs need to show who should be feared in the city of Chicago.</p>
<p>Go Cubs, take care of the Sox!</p>
