<p>MLB rosters have expanded and the Cubs have begun to tap into the minor league pitching.  We go through the current list of players that the Cubs have called up and recently activated from the disabled list.  The Cubs have announced who they will be sending to play for the Mesa Solar Sox in the Arizona Fall League and we look at what we hope to learn about the players in their time in the league.  </p>
<p>We answer listener questions and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
