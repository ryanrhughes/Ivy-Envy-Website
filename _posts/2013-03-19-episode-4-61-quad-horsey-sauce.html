<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt convene to talk about the last week with the Chicago Cubs.  We start things off by letting you know that once the season begins, we will move our episodes to Sunday evenings at 8:30pm Central.  </p>
<p>Episode #200 is on the horizon and on this episode, we tell you all of our plans.  Episode #100 was our first live video broadcast and since then, every week we've invited you to watch us in the studio on our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">live broadcast page</a>.  Well, for episode #200, we're literally inviting you into the studio.  Here's the flyer for the weekend, which is June 7th - 9th.  Listen to this episode for all the details.  </p>

<p>Javier Baez apparently wanted to make sure that all Cubs fans were aware of him before he got sent down to the minor league camp.  Saturday was the first Cubs television broadcast and he caught the attention of everyone watching.  We talk about his performance this spring, what he needs to work on to become a more complete player, and we discuss what his path to the majors may look like.  </p>
<p>The Cubs signed a Cuban relief pitcher, Armando Rivero.  Andy tells us about his daring escape to freedom.  The Ian Stewart story gets more humorous/depressing.  So much for those exciting 30 at-bats.  Will the Cubs keep him?  Listen for our thoughts.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have unveiled new slogans/mottos/themes for their 2013 marketing campaign.  We struggle to find anything positive to say about "Committed", "Not if, when" and "Nothing worth having ever comes easy".  </p>
<p>Andy and Kurt have a few internet muscle flexes for this episode and Kurt's takes a dark turn.  We wade through a lot of submissions for the photo caption contest and after facing a 4-way tie, award a first-time winner.  </p>
