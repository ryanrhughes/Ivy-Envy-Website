<p>Cubs fans are experiencing many emotions after the last week, and more specifically, the weekend series with the Cardinals.  Quade's decision-making became the most discussed topic between Cubs fans until Carlos Zambrano let off some steam and called the team out to the media after Sunday's loss.</p>
<p>Tonight, we want to hear your opinions on these topics.  We will be doing our first live broadcast.  The plan is to start things at 8pm.  The broadcast will be streamed to our site and you can listen to it <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?page_id=5362" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; You can also click on the "Live Broadcast" tab at the top of our page.&nbsp; We'd love for you to call in and talk about Quade, Zambrano and the Cubs.&nbsp; The call-in number is 309-623-4936.&nbsp; We won't be able to screen calls and put them on hold, so when we are between calls, and we ask for another caller, just dial us up.</p>
<p>We have kicked around the idea of doing a live show for a while and this seems like a good opportunity to give it a try.&nbsp; We will be recording the show and it'll go up on our podcast feed later tonight.</p>
