<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey via Skype for this episode.  Corey talks about an Angels/Dodgers game and Jose Canseco in a HR Derby.  We discuss the Giants series and White Sox series and look at the health of the pitching staff.  We reminisce about the Doug Davis days and look ahead to the days of the next scrap-heap pitcher, Ramon Ortiz.  </p>
<p>Carlos Zambrano gets people worked up by throwing out the first pitch at a softball game after leaving a game because of an injury.  And lastly, we look at the Cubs' representation at the 2011 MLB All-Star Game.  We also read your entries for the photo caption contest.  </p>
