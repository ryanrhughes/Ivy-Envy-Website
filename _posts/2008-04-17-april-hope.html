  content: I remember that Steve Stone remark.  I think it was in the 1990 season.  As
    immature 12 year olds, it was the highlight of our day, for sure.  I'm also pretty
    sure we followed it up with a mean game of fast-pitch tennis ball-baseball in
    the Seaton grade school parking lot.

<p><strong>April 1991: Pittsburgh</strong></p>
<p>The bases were loaded, and Andre Dawson came up to bat in the top of the ninth.&nbsp; The Cubs were down 3-0.&nbsp; I rocked back and forth on the couch and watched anxiously as Dawson dug in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be awsome if he hit a grand slam?" I mused aloud.&nbsp; As soon as I said it, I realized I was falling into my typical routine of willing my woeful team to win.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-19"></a></p>
<p>The very next pitch, Dawson hit the ball over the left field fence.&nbsp; We exploded into celebratory high-fives (the Canseco-McGwire bash was&nbsp;uncool by this time I believe).&nbsp; I felt prophetic.</p>
<p>Much to our dismay, however, the Cubs' closer Dave Smith&nbsp;went on to blow the&nbsp;save in the bottom of the ninth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This game is one of my most vivid memories of being a Cubs fan, and it embodies much of my Cubs experience--a build up of tension and excitement often followed by the familiar scenario of blowing it in the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day, when I was watching the game at Paul's house, the Cubs blew a ninth inning comeback opportunity.&nbsp; The video feed cut away to blackness, yet the audio remained.&nbsp; We could distinctly hear Steve Stone railing about the Cubs' play that day.&nbsp; "These damn Cubs!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my Cubs experience hasn't been all Bartman and blown opportunities.&nbsp; There have been plenty of peaks to go along with the valleys.&nbsp; Win or lose, I always enjoyed watching my favorite player, Ryne Sandberg, play.&nbsp; I loved listening to Harry Caray.&nbsp; One time I was watching the Cubs play the Cardinals in St. Louis, and coming back from a commercial, Harry said, "Here we are... back at Busch Memorial Hospital."&nbsp; Though he did have his miscues as a commentator, I loved his enthusiasm.&nbsp; I got to see my first game at Wrigley in the early nineties.&nbsp; The&nbsp;field was verdant and charged with excitement,&nbsp;and we sat on the first base line near Mark Grace.</p>
<p>The Cubs have given me plenty to cheer about in the past, and I'm sure that this year's team will be no exception.&nbsp; My favorite current players are Mark DeRosa, Ted Lilly, and Kerry Wood.&nbsp; I enjoyed watching Jason Kendall last season, and I was disappointed that the Cubs let him go.&nbsp; The current roster is strong, however, and they are on the cusp of a great season.</p>
<p>Go Cubs Go!</p>
