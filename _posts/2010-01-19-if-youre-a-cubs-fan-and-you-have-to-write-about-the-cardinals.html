<p>I'd like to give a shout-out to regular Ivy Envy podcast guest and Dispatch-Argus sportswriter, Matt Veto.&nbsp; Veto has the unfortunate responsibility of covering the Cardinals and their Single-A affiliate here in the Quad Cities.&nbsp; With the Cardinals Caravan rolling into town yesterday, I expected today's Sports Page to be dominated by Cardinals.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised when I started <a href="http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=475928">Veto's column</a> and saw the word "steroids" five words in.&nbsp; I appreciate the reminder to the general public that the Cardinals have hired an admitted cheater.</p>
<p>I mentioned this whole McGwire/Jack Clark thing to a Cardinals fan today and he stated he felt that Jack Clark deserved boo's for "speaking against a fellow former Cardinal".&nbsp; The following quote is from Veto's column:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What he and Sammy (Sosa) did at the time put people in the seats for the next five or 10 years, even up until today. It rejuvenated the game. I kind of wished the whole thing never came out, but it did." -- Former third baseman Ken Reitz on Mark McGwire and his steroids admission.</blockquote><br />
Yes, the regret is that it came out.&nbsp; There's no regret that those guys were inflating statistics by injecting themselves.</p>
<p>For some reason, my hatred for the Cardinals has softened in the last few years.&nbsp; It's quickly becoming more intense than it ever was.&nbsp; I suppose posts on consecutive days about the Cardinals might be the first sign that this is happening.</p>
