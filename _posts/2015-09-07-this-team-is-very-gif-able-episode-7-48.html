Granted, the playoff percentages have been above 90% for quite a while, it still hasn't felt like a safe lead.  </p>
<p>On this episode (the 355<sup>th</sup> episode of our podcast), we talk about the series sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks.  We continue swooning over Jake Arrieta's dominance and Kris Bryant's ridiculous power. The Cubs have a pretty important series coming up in St. Louis and the pitching match-ups definitely don't favor the Cubs.</p>
<p>We have several listener questions to get to, list off some Jake Arrieta scary stats and read a few internet muscle flexes. </p>
