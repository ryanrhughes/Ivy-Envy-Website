<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt take a look at some of the hot stove rumors swirling around heading in the winter meetings.  Of course, we can't avoid the two-headed Pujols/Fielder beast and the rumors that the Cubs are interested in these big money free agents.  Last week, we talked about Matt Garza, and this week we look at a few more current Cubs that are supposedly on the trading block - Randy Wells and Carlos Marmol.  </p>
<p>Dale Sveum finds his bench coach and we find next week's photo for the caption contest.  And....Greg Maddux leaves the Cubs...again.  </p>
