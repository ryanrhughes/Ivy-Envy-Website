<p>A few podcast episodes ago, I said that Doug Davis would be one of those guys that 5 years from now, I would not recall him playing for the Cubs.  That became more likely today when the Cubs released him.  </p>
<p>The 35 year-old veteran was signed by the Cubs in May to plug the holes in the rotation caused by Randy Wells and Andrew Cashner going down to injuries.  His Cubs debut happened to be the day of our charter bus trip to the Cubs/Giants game.  Davis suffered the loss and followed that game up with 5 losses and a no-decision in his next six starts.  </p>
<p>The one bright spot in Davis' tenure with the Cubs was an unexpected gem against the Yankees.  Davis gave up 1 run on 3 hits in 7 1/3 innings of work and was rewarded with a standing ovation by the crowd at Wrigley.  His pitching performance allowed the Cubs to escape with their lone win in the inter-league series.  </p>
<p>Davis' next two outings against the White Sox and Giants were back to normal.  The Cubs finally pulled the plug on Davis today, following his abysmal performance yesterday against the Giants.  Davis gave up 10 runs on 12 hits in 4 1/3 innings.  The Cubs needed a better showing from Davis as the bullpen was sure to be strapped in the day/night doubleheader and the stretch of 18 games in 17 days before the All-Star Break.</p>
<p>Davis was a low-risk/high-reward type signing and his short stint with the Cubs is completed.  Just remember the name "Doug Davis" for some obscure trivia question on an Ivy Envy Bus Trip to a Cubs game 4 or 5 years from now.  While everyone else is saying "he played for the Cubs?", you'll be saying "ugh...yeah, he played for the Cubs."</p>
