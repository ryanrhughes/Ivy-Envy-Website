<p>So far this team has been difficult to watch (as they always are), but there are some encouraging aspects we can hold on to while our hearts palpitate about the rest.</p>
<p>-I'm starting to feel fairly confident in the starting rotation.&nbsp; Dempster and Wells had great outings, and Zambrano looked a lot better yesterday.&nbsp; Dempster had <em>nine</em> strikeouts!&nbsp; Silva looks to be effective for the first time in years.&nbsp; I may want to reel these words of confidence back in depending on how it goes with Gorzelanny today, but once Ted gets back, this looks to be one part of the Cubs machine that will be reliable.</p>
<p>-The defense has been solid since the first game.&nbsp; Fontenot and Lee had great plays in the field yesterday, and L &amp; B can't stop singing the praises of Fukudome's quickfire D in right.&nbsp; I thought for sure Byrd was going to run down and rob that homer.&nbsp; He can move pretty well for his all his Bulk Vanderhuge-ness.&nbsp; Watch Fontenot's diving play <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=7363439" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>-Marmol had his grossest sliders of the season going on in yesterday's game.&nbsp; He appeared to be untouchable.&nbsp; And Bob is so damn right it hurts when he is talking about Marmol throwing his fastball more.&nbsp; When you have a mid-nineties fastball and are having trouble controlling the breaking pitches, throw the heat, man.&nbsp; But the slider was sharp yesterday, and it was beautiful to watch.&nbsp; Some other gross sliders--</p>

<p>I guess this is a good time to transition to the bad stuff.</p>
<p>-John Grabow is the new Neil Cotts.&nbsp; He is at the top of my list of Cubs pitchers that I can barely stand to watch.&nbsp; Corey keeps reiterating how this bullpen will be difficult to live with all year.&nbsp; I still feel a slight twinge of confidence in Caridad, despite him serving up that 4-run homer the other night.&nbsp; We'll see how long that twinge lasts.&nbsp; I might just need a Tums.</p>
<p>-According to Muskat, "12 of the Cubs' total 17 runs have come on 8 homers."&nbsp; While it is fun to see some power hitting, it is equally fun to see a string of base hits turn into multiple-run rally.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to when the Cubs do this, although I'm not holding my breath for it after seeing the swings they were all taking yesterday.</p>
<p>-Lee should not attempt to steal.&nbsp; I know he has a great stride length, but his turnover frequency is not good.&nbsp; He was picked off at first yesterday, and he was caught stealing later in the game.&nbsp; Getting caught stealing is Theriot's department, okay?</p>
<p>It is the last game against the Reds today, and then finally we are home to Wrigley.&nbsp; Maybe a homecoming will lead to a winning streak.</p>
