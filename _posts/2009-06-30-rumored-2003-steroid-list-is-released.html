  content: I'm sort of surprised by someone like Soriano, honestly.  I've always had
    it in my head that spindly players like him have a "Bonds-esque" transformation
    when they use steroids.  Do steroids make people grow fingers sometimes?

  content: "We knew Garciaparra was dropping dirty because of the groin injury he
    sustained.  The two names that surprise me (if this is true) are Derek Lee and
    Kerry Wood.  \r\n\r\nThe name that does not surprise me, though it might surprise
    a lot of Cubs fans, is Aramis Ramirez.  If you look at pictures of him from 3
    or 4 years ago, he was much bigger than he is now."

  content: I am extremely surprised to learn that people like Woodie, DLee, Prior,
    Z, and Ramirez were dirty.  It doesn't change my feelings on any of them, but
    even so, it's just surprising.

  content: Ramirez doesn't surprise me in the least.  In 2005, I predicted he was
    juiced.  He's also slimmed down quite a bit in the last few years.

  content: I've been listening to the radio an awful lot.. Thgey were talking about
    steroids in baseball, as Manny has just returned.. That list is either a comlete
    scham, which is what I think, or ESPN is way late to the game.. which doesn't
    seem as likely.

  content: Wow.. Reading through that thing.. It's a joke.  There's a reason why nobody
    is talking about it other than us. I'm not buying it.

  content: "We weren't the only people talking about it.  A google search shows about
    3/4 of a million hits.  I wrote this post the day it was released.  It was
    discussed in the blogging/message board world, but never really got covered
    in the real media.  That's because they know how to filter and determine if a
    story is valid.  We don't have those resources, so we speculate and give mention
    to items like this.  It's what makes the blog-world interesting to fans.  \r\n\r\nI
    was pretty clear at the beginning of this post that it might be completely false.
    \ I didn't really lend it any credibility.  I'd be pretty shocked if the list
    really is accurate.  If anyone read this post and thought that Ivy Envy believed
    the list was legitimate, they had better not get ahold of Weekly World News or
    The Onion.\r\n\r\nBut if over 100 MLB players tested positive, which we know is
    true, why do you think any particular name on there is a joke?"

  content: I don't know.. I suppose it's because I live in the United States.. Where
    you're innocent until proven guilty.  (I learned this on Cops.)  Probably the
    same reason why Barry Bond's will still probably make the Hall even though we
    all know he's most likely a roid filled bag of douche and why Rafael Palmeiro,
    Sammy Sosa, Roger Clemens, and Neifi Perez will have harder times getting the
    same treatment.  He just hasn't been proved to have tested positive yet.

  content: The Hall of Fame is easily determined by the court of public opinion.  Whether
    he's been found guilty of using steroids or not, the public knows he used them.  The
    Supreme Court doesn't put guys in the Hall of Fame, journalists do...and they
    don't have to have any good reason to put one guy in and leave another guy out.

  content: I think Bond's will make it... Eventually.  He's not going to be a first
    ballot guy like his numbers deserve.  I think Santo has a better chance at being
    in there sooner, but stranger things have happened.  On the subject of the Hall,
    I think Pete Rose needs to be in there.  It's not a a Hall of Character, it's
    a Hall of Fame.

<p>Since I'm on vacation, I'm a bit out of the loop.&nbsp; This may have been discussed on Chicago-based and national sports radio.&nbsp; It may be the biggest news in sports or it's so flimsy nobody has noticed it.&nbsp; I have no idea if this is true and I'd suggest you give it the same amount of credibility.&nbsp; Supposedly, <a href="http://rotoinfo.com/read_article.php?articleId=318">the list of baseball players that tested positive for steroids in 2003 has been released</a>.&nbsp; Some of the players with connections to the Cubs are:&nbsp; Nomar Garciaparra, Alfonso Soriano, Milton Bradley, Derek Lee, Cliff Floyd, Moises Alou, Corey Patterson, Carlos Zambrano, Mark Prior, Kerry Wood, Matt Clement, Antonio Alfonseca, Gary Matthews Jr and Aramis Ramirez.</p>
<p>If the list is accurate, some of those names don't surprise me and some shock me....even though they probably shouldn't.</p>
<p>Weigh in with your opinions here.&nbsp; Which names surprise you and which names don't?</p>
