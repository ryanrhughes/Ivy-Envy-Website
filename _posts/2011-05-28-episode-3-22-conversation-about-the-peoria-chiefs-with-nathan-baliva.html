<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Jeremy look at the Mets series and the first game of the series with the Pirates.  We talk about some improvement we're seeing with the offense and areas that are still sources of major concern, mainly Aramis Ramirez.  We talk a look at Ramirez's inexplicable drop in power and consider his future with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We take a look at some of the topics that some listeners sent to us.  Justin from Kansas asks about the pitching staff. Andy from West Des Moines would like to know why the Cubs are trying to rehab older veteran players rather than bringing pitchers up from the minors.  Josh from Moline raises the "collision at the plate" topic because of Buster Posey's injury.  Then, Brad from Effingham, IL asks how we feel about the management or mis-management of the bullpen and starts, the playing time for Reed Johnson and the defensive problems of Koyie Hill.  </p>
<p>Nathan Baliva, the Broadast & Media Manager and play-by-play voice of the Peoria Chiefs comes on the show to talk about the Chiefs with us.  It's a real interesting conversation and we thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to talk Chiefs baseball with us.  </p>
