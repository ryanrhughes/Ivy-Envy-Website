  content: Yeah.  I would assume that the club would rather announce it first.

<p>Len and Bob have mentioned multiple times tonight that Jeff Samardzija may be called up the Cubs since Kerry Wood was placed on the disabled list.&nbsp; They stated the decision of who the Cubs decided to call up would be announced after the game tonight.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote><p>7/24/08<br />

If this is true, it happened much sooner than I expected.&nbsp; He has posted a 4-1 record with a 3.13 ERA in his short stint in Iowa and has apparently earned himself what will probably be an extended weekend in Chicago.&nbsp; I never imagined I would see a Notre Dame football player in a Cubs uniform.&nbsp; Samardzija has brought together <a id="more"></a><a id="more-140"></a>my love for the Irish and the Cubs.</p>
<p>I had discussed before that I needed to find a new favorite player.&nbsp; Now, how could it be anyone else?&nbsp; But I'm not ready to make that commitment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following YouTube clip is from my favorite Samardzija play.&nbsp; I was at this game and Samardzija scored this TD right in front of us.&nbsp; Notre Dame had struggled offensively all day and was 80 yards and 90 seconds from losing to UCLA.&nbsp; This ended the drive and gave the Irish a victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>That was just pulled from Samardzija's blog.</p>
<p>Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
