<p>Today, the Cubs placed Geovany Soto on the DL after injuring his groin last night against the Cardinals.  Koyie Hill came in to replace Soto and kicked all Cubs fans in the groin.  I can't express how much I dislike Koyie Hill.  Forget the fact that Hill was completely useless at the plate, going 0-4 and stranding 6 baserunners, but Hill's defense is touted as the reason he is even on this roster.  In the 7th inning, with runners on 2nd and 3rd, Ryan Theriot lined out to Fukudome, who threw the ball home and the throw probably beat Nick Punto by 5-7 feet and Hill promptly just drops the throw and the Cardinals score.  I would love to hear one person defend Koyie Hill.  I'm sure he's a nice guy and he's done pretty well since going to battle with that band saw, but why he's on the team, and why the Cubs gave him a hefty raise this season, I'll never know.</p>
<p>To fill Soto's roster spot and, at least at first, act as Koyie Hill's backup (there's an embarrassing title, the Cubs called up Welington Castillo from Iowa.  Castillo started the season in high-A Daytona and was called up to Iowa on 4/21.  </p>

<p>This will not be Castillo's first stint with the big league team.  He came up late in the year last year, playing in seven games with six hits in 21 plate appearances.  He is probably most well-known for his bat breaking and "impaling" Tyler Colvin.  </p>

<p>Castillo will probably start on Friday or Saturday.  In his 26 games this season with Daytona and Iowa, he's batting .242 with 3 HR and 11 RBIs.  So don't look for Castillo to come in and be as productive as Soto, but he's not Koyie Hill, so I'll take whatever he can give us.  </p>
<p>The Cubs also brought up Doug Davis.  His is a name Cubs fans should be familiar with.  Davis has been in the majors since 1999 and spent 2003-2006 and 2010 with the Brewers.  Davis is 35 years old and signed with the Cubs about a month ago.  </p>

<p>Davis went 1-4 with a 7.51 ERA in 2010 and then had elbow surgery in October.  The worst news about Doug Davis being called up to the Cubs is that he'll be getting his first start since July 9, 2010 on Saturday, which happens to be the game for the Ivy Envy Bus Trip.  It's bad enough the temperature will be in the mid 50's and they are forecasting rain, but now we'll have to sit through the start of a pitcher that 5 years from now, we'll say "Wait, when did he ever play for the Cubs?"  The way this thing is shaping up, I fully expect John Grabow to be called in to mop up.  On the bright side, I'm looking forward to the D'agostino's Pizza at Wrigley.  As a vegetarian, usually my only option for ballpark fare is nachos, so I'm looking forward to being able to consume some good pizza.  </p>
