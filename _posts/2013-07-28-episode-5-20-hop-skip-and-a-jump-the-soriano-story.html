<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt spend the vast majority of this podcast sharing their thoughts on Alfonso Soriano's years with the Cubs.  The variety of opinions on Soriano over the years is an odd thing.  There was also a lot of variety in the listener comments on Soriano's years with the Cubs.  At the end, we decided his years could best be summed up with: "meh".  </p>
<p>Andy and Corey talk about what they have seen from the Kane County Cougars, specifically Albert Almora and Dan Vogelbach in their series in Peoria.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a Scary Stat of the Week, we read a few Internet Muscle Flexes and we pick a winner for this week's photo contest, who will be awarded a copy of the MLB Productions DVD "MLB Bloopers: Deluxe DoubleHeader".  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, we will be sending out another bonus episode of the podcast.  This time it will be Corey's interview with Cubs prospect, Dan Vogelbach.  </p>
