<p>Apparently, I was not the only person with this concept on my mind today.&nbsp; On my way home from work, I was listening to The Score, WSCR 670AM and Terry Boers and Dan Bernstein were discussing this very same issue.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-52"></a></p>
<p>According to them, this is mainly a Chicago Cubs fan phenomenon.&nbsp; They stated that it is only Cubs fans that live and die on every game and predict the rest of the season based on a game or series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it's because we've seen it all go wrong so many times.&nbsp; Those painful memories come flooding back to us and we can only assume that the same heartache is just around the corner.</p>
<p>They traced it back to, and blamed it on, Chip Caray.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to these guys, it was as if he was broadcasting the apocolypse.&nbsp; I don't remember that, but I didn't get to see many Cubs games during his era due to work/college/living in other parts of the country without cable</p>
<p>All I know is that if Boers and Bernstein are correct, it's just further proof to me that the Cubs have helped define who I am.&nbsp; For better or for worse, usually the latter, they have become part of me.&nbsp;</p>
