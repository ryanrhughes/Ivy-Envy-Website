  content: Gentlemen, this roster will be fluid and in transition throughout the season
    incrementally seeking to improve the overall organization as well as the final
    product line. More confidence is about how those at the MLB level is playing (as
    opposed to last couple of years) led by the new regime. I think this team will
    improve on last year if they play Sveum ball. Being cynical for cynical sake does
    not inform, it merely is the media's herd mentality.

  content: I was hoping you could recommend a good Cubs podcast because when I listen
    to you guys in the car it makes me want to pass out and swerve off the road.&nbsp;
    Your voices are so droll that I want to stick a screwdriver into my skull to make
    you stop.&nbsp; No seriously, I need another podcast.&nbsp; I'm from the Quad
    Cities and I was hoping for the best for you guys but you don't get any better.&nbsp;
    I don't give a shit about your hat or your video games or how much you love some
    crappy sports bar.&nbsp; I love the Cubs.&nbsp; I want good Cubs coverage and
    ever since Cubscast went belly up I've had to endure you guys. Blah, blah, blah,
    blah, blah.&nbsp; That's all I hear when I listen to you guys.&nbsp; Give me a
    way out.&nbsp; Get better or turn it over to someone worth listening to.

    &nbsp;@PortlandCub&nbsp;
    We don't listen to other Cubs podcasts, so you're on your own. &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    We are normal fans, talking about the Cubs. &nbsp;I don't think we ever claimed to be more, but sorry we didn't live up to your expectations. &nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    Thanks for stopping by. &nbsp;Feel free to stop torturing yourself. &nbsp;

    @PortlandCub
    It's pretty clear you don't fit into our listener-base, though. &nbsp;Everyone we interact with is pretty decent and you hurl insults anonymously. &nbsp;

    Let's this break this down sentence by sentence:
    &nbsp;
    "I was hoping you could recommend a good Cubs podcast because when I listen to you guys in the car it makes me want to pass out and swerve off the road.&nbsp; Your voices are so droll that I want to stick a screwdriver into my skull to make you stop"
    &nbsp;
    You seem to have some weird sort of punsihment complex as evidenced by the tone of your entire comment.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "No seriously, I need another podcast."
    &nbsp;
    Other than the fact that this sentence is completely unnecessary, for a guy that seems to have everything figured out you sure aren't very good at using the internet.&nbsp; Are you familiar with Google?&nbsp; It's a search engine that allows for its users to locate certain websites online.&nbsp; Go to www.google.com&nbsp;and then type in whatever you're looking for (Books online, Cubs podcasts, or in your case -&nbsp;hot shemale rimjobs) and it will literally bring up millions of websites that can help you find what you're looking for,&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "I'm from the Quad Cities and I was hoping for the best for you guys but you don't get any better."
    &nbsp;
    It doesn't matter where you live.&nbsp; Do you 'expect better' from us since we live in your hometown?&nbsp; Would you like us to take some pictures of the Centennial Bridge at sunset&nbsp;and drop them off at your front door?&nbsp; This statement is also a run-on sentence.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "I don't give a shit about your hat or your video games or how much you love some crappy sports bar"
    &nbsp;
    Obviously, you're not familiar with how radio works. From time to time,on a broadcast, it's common for the hosts to get off topic.&nbsp; Most listeners find it refreshing, but you clearly don't.&nbsp; And as far as you giving us grief for mentioning the sponsor, if I have to explain to you how that works I might as well just stop over and show you how to operate the velcro on your shoes and how to use your microwave.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "I love the Cubs"
    &nbsp;
    So do we.&nbsp; Now only if we were into tranny porn, then we'd have two things in common.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "I want good Cubs coverage and ever since Cubscast went belly up I've had to endure you guys"
    &nbsp;
    Wait a minute "had to endure you guys"?&nbsp; When was anybody requiring you to listen to our internet radio show?&nbsp; Nobody is putting a gun to your head and making you come to this website.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.&nbsp; That's all I hear when I listen to you guys."
    &nbsp;
    You're not very good at understanding English then.&nbsp; There's this company called Rosetta Stone that makes these tutorials on how to learn new languages in a very short amount of time.&nbsp; When you figure out how to use Google maybe you can look it up.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "Give me a way out."
    &nbsp;
    Listen to WLLR -&nbsp;they play a ton of Toby Keith which should be right up your alley.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    "Get better or turn it over to someone worth listening to"
    &nbsp;
    So, let me get this straight - You want us to fire ourselves for a job that we don't get paid for, then find someone else to replace us for no pay just to make you happy?&nbsp; In what world is that reasonable?&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    ...
    &nbsp;
    To be perfectly honest with you, I don't even care that you don't like the show.&nbsp; It's your opinion, you're entitled to your opinion, and I'm sure that your show is MUCH better than ours.&nbsp; What pisses me off is that you act like we don't have real jobs, don't work fifty hours a week, and spend all week preparing for Saturday morning's show.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    What I really would like to know is - how long did it take you to reach this conclusion about our site?&nbsp; Usually if I don't like some form of entertainment, I know almost immediately.&nbsp; I don't need to watch "30 Rock" for an entire season to know that Tracy Morgan isn't funny and that Alec Baldwin should probably be burned for fuel.&nbsp; My point is, if our voices were so "droll" wouldn't you have caught that in the first five minutes?&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    If you don't like it, don't consume it.&nbsp; Either way we make the same amount of money and don't lose any sleep.
    &nbsp;
    Sincerely,
    &nbsp;
    Ryan @RAVENATION837
    &nbsp;
    Post-Script:&nbsp; Also, I find it very insulting that you go out of your way to demand that we find you a different podcast to listen to.&nbsp; It isn't our responsibility to steer you towards our competition when you feel like you have been ripped off by something that was essentially free to begin with?&nbsp;

  content: Thanks for the breakdown, I appreciate your time.&nbsp; I, however, have
    moved on and I hope you will too.&nbsp; There's real baseball out there fellas.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
    wrote that comment in a moment of pre-season frustration.&nbsp; I don't regret
    it but I really didn't mean to piss you guys off so much.&nbsp; In the end my
    opinion doesn't meant that much and you should maybe have a thicker skin about
    this stuff.&nbsp; That's the rough and tumble world of podcasting.&nbsp; Not everyone
    is going to love you.&nbsp; I really do wish you guys the best.&nbsp; In the end
    we are all Cubs fans and it's a hard enough life as it is.&nbsp; I must now get
    back to my trany porn. Cheers.

<p>Andy and Corey predict the starting rotation for the 2012 Cubs and share their confidence not just in the starters, but also the bullpen.  We look at Ryan Dempster, Matt Garza, Paul Maholm, Jeff Samardzija and Chris Volstad, and assume that Randy Wells is on the outside looking in.  </p>
<p>We also comment on Bryan LaHair's improved numbers over the last week, and if those numbers continue, what that means to Anthony Rizzo and his move up to the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We talk with Joe Martin from Spring Training and he talks about a display of power he witnessed from Anthony Rizzo, Brett Jackson and James Adduci.  </p>
<p>Then we come back and pick co-winners for the photo caption contest.  </p>
