  content: "I just saw the Seinfeld episode where Jerry heckles the lady at work.
    Priceless. \r\n\r\nI agree and what I hate even more is Cubs fans who heckle other
    Cubs fans. I went to opening day in 06 when it was 35 degrees. They were playing
    the Birds and my winter coat had red on it. I got harassed by some asshole who
    needed to prove his superfan status.\r\n\r\nBTW, you would make a horrible Yankee
    fan with your restrained expectations and anti-booing sentiment."

<p>I've been putting off this post for a few days, but a Monday night with no Cubs game and a wife that wants to watch The Bachelorette is giving me the 20 minutes it takes for me to construct a post and then go back and attempt to fix all my grammatical errors.</p>
<p>During Lou's presser after Saturday's game, he mentioned an interaction he had with a fan after pulling out Kevin Gregg.&nbsp; Apparently, the fan criticized Piniella for not pulling Gregg sooner.&nbsp; Since when did $200 for a good seat and some Old Style give you the right to heckle a MLB player or manager?&nbsp; I can understand the frustration in the situation.&nbsp; My couch took more punches in that 20 minutes than it has in it's 30 years of existence...yes, we have hand-me-down furniture.&nbsp; I have no doubt that all of us were more frustrated in the top half of the 9th inning than we have been all season.&nbsp; But really, what good does it do to make a fool out of yourself in front of millions of people by calling out the manager in the middle of the game?</p>
<p>I'm not big on the booing of players or managers, either.&nbsp; If a player is struggling, what good will it do to boo them?&nbsp; Soto, Lee and Bradley come to mind.&nbsp; You think you are bothered more by their performances than they are?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Now, if a player does not show effort and...oh...say....gets thrown out at second after going into a homerun trot on contact and then realizing the ball isn't going over the fence , boo away.&nbsp; That's laziness and worthy of booing.&nbsp; A conscious decision was made to loaf on the play.</p>
<p>Unless you want this guy showing up at your work and heckling you after you make what he perceives to be a mistake, enjoy the ballgame and shut up.</p>
