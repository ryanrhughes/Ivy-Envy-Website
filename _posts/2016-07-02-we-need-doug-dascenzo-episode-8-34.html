<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 412th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  This was kind of an impromptu recording. As Corey and Andy were sitting in the garage, talking about the Cubs, they decided to sit down behind mics and knock out this week's episode.  After two losses to the Mets, Cubs fans are feeling pretty down and we talk about why Cubs fans should be worried about the team's recent performance and we try to put things into context.  </p>
<p>This is a short episode and if you're just finding our podcast, this is not your typical episode.  Happy Independence Day!</p>
