<p>Ivy Envy is based in the Quad Cities, IL.  We are 90 miles from Peoria which is close, but not convenient for being able to watch the Cubs Single-A affiliate, the Peoria Chiefs.  However, a few times a year, the Chiefs drive up I-74 to visit us and play our hometown Quad Cities River Bandits.  The Bandits are a Cardinals affiliate, but a nice stadium on the riverfront and the Chiefs in town will draw us to Modern Woodmen to watch the Cubs prospects.</p>
<p>The Peoria Chiefs will be in the Quad Cities to play the River Bandit this Monday through Wednesday.  If you haven't been to Modern Woodmen Park, mid-April isn't exactly the ideal time to go, but if you want to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><del datetime="2011-04-16T00:21:39+00:00">see</del></span> walk over the Mississippi River, this would be a great series to watch. &nbsp;The floodwaters are a-rising, but it's not expected to affect the games. &nbsp;The parking situation will be interesting since at least 1/2 of the parking will be under water. &nbsp;The Bandits are constructing a pedestrian walk-way over the water, so even though the perimeter of the ballpark will be underwater, the games will go on.</p>
<p>If you haven't followed the Chiefs in the first few weeks of the season, these are the guys that are playing well that you'll see:</p>
<p><strong>Matt Szczur - </strong> Szczur was drafted by the Cubs in the 5th round of the 2010 draft out of Villanova University.  He was a standout for the Wildcats in both baseball and football.  He hit .443 in 2009, and he was also on the 2009 FCS Football Championship team, winning the Championship Game MVP with 270 all-purpose yard.  Szczur spent time at Boise after being drafted.  He was there for 18 games and hit .394 with nine doubles, eight RBIs and 17 runs scored while with Boise.  He spent a week with the Chiefs last year.  </p>
<p><strong>Rubi Silva -</strong> You might recognize his name as one of the Cuban players the Cubs signed in this most recent off-season.  This is the 21 year old's first professional season.  He has been making great contact at the plate for the Chiefs.  He has seemed to adapt to the chilly Midwest April weather and he carried an 8-game hitting streak, which was ended in the 2nd game of a double-header on Sunday.  He's currently batting .378 and he's shown early on that he is reliable with runners on (.429) and with runners in scoring position (.500).</p>
<p><strong>Pierre LePage - </strong>LePage was drafted by the Cubs in the 13th round of the 2010 draft, out of the University of Connecticut.  He spent time in 2010 with Boise and he was named a NWL Post-Season All-Star, hitting .331 with 38 RBIs in 65 games.  LePage has historically been very patient at the plate.  He had 248 at-bats his final year at UConn and struck out just twice.  </p>
<p><strong>Smaily Borges -</strong> Smaily Borges is in a fierce battle with Arismendy Alcantara for the best name on the 2011 Chiefs.  Smaily spent the entire 2010 season in Daytona and hit .227 with six homers, 14 doubles and 26 RBIs.  These aren't great numbers and what makes Smaily interesting (other than his name) is that, at 27, he is the oldest player on the roster and he will also serve as an extra coach for the Chiefs this season.  Smaily is off to a good start in 2011, though.  He is hitting .400 on the season.  </p>
<p><strong>Greg Rohan - </strong>Rohan returns to Peoria after starting the 2010 season with the Chiefs before being called up to Daytona.  The Ohio native is hitting the ball well for the Chiefs so far in 2011.  He's hit safely in every game and brings a .333 batting average into the series against the River Bandits.  </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Probable Pitchers</strong></span><br />
<strong>Hayden Simpson -</strong> I have written on Hayden Simpson a few times over the last few weeks.  Simpson was the Cubs #1 Draft Pick in 2010.  He didn't pitch in 2010 because of a bout of mononucleosis.  This will be Simpson's third start of the 2011 season.  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4784" target="_blank">I witness and wrote about his professional debut</a> in Peoria, where he went 3 2/3 innings, giving up one run on three hits.  He walked one and struck out seven.  Simpson's second showing was a little less stellar.  He went 5 innings and gave up five runs on 8 hits, walking one and striking out two.  Simpson enters Monday's game with no decisions and a 4.15 ERA.  This could be your chance to see a Cubs prospect and #1 Draft Pick get his first professional win.</p>
<p><strong>Austin Kirk - </strong>The Oklahoma native should take the mound Tuesday night.  Kirk was selected in the 3rd Round by the Cubs in the 2009 draft.  Just by looking at the numbers, it seems that you can expect strikeouts and walks from Kirk.  In 7 innings pitched this year, Kirk has only given up four hits.  He's walked four and struck out eight.  Opponents are only batting .148 off Kirk, but it seems that besides some control issues, he's prone to make a mistake or two a game and give up the long-ball.  Of the four hits he's allowed, two of them were homeruns.  </p>
<p><strong>Robinson Lopez - </strong>Lopez came over to the Cubs in the Derrek Lee trade with the Braves.  He went to the Chiefs after the trade and he's returned there this year.  Lopez has given up six runs on 12 hits in 9 innings pitched.  He had a rough first outing and looked better in his second start, pitching 5 innings of shutout baseball against Burlington.  </p>
<p>The Chiefs employ the piggy-back system of pitching, so you will see quite a few Chiefs pitchers over the series.  I have just seen the Chiefs once this year and I look forward to being able to see them 3 or 4 times in the next few weeks.  If you're in the Quad Cities, don't let the floodwaters or chilly weather scare you off.  This is a great opportunity to see some of the young talent in the system at their beginning stages.  </p>
