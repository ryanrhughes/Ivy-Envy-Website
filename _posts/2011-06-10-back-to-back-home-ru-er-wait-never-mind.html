If you missed last night's game between the Cubs and the Phillies, you missed one of the most entertaining games of the year (in my stupid opinion).&nbsp; This game had it all.&nbsp; It had</p>
<ul>
<li>a Campana head-first slide into first (he was out)</li>
<li>a bullet hit straight back at Sean Marshall's head that he caught in self-defense</li>
<li>a thrilling, hour-long-plus rain delay</li>
<li>an appearance by every position player except for Koyie Hill</li>
<li>a shaky John Grabow inning, replete with a balk</li>
<li>Fieldin Culbreth as the home plate ump</li>
<li>a Carlos Pena collision with the fence that appeared fierce enough to cause yet another injury</li><br />
</ul><br />
But best of all, it had an apparent home run hit by Tyler Colvin called a double after some hot replay action.&nbsp; Colvin was riding a torrid 0-34 streak at the plate when this craziness occurred.&nbsp; I was ridiculously excited after what appeared to be back-to-back homers by the Cubs.&nbsp; That excitement soon turned sour when the homer was ruled a double due to fan interference.&nbsp; <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_06_09_chnmlb_phimlb_1&amp;mode=recap_away&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Here is the link to the replay</a>, in case you missed it.&nbsp; It looked to me like the ball was going to bounce off the top of the fence had the fan not interfered.&nbsp; Though he reached over the fence, it looked to me like the ball struck him in the forearm.&nbsp; At any rate, the Cubs ended up winning the game later, so it became a non-factor.&nbsp; Anyone else out there have an opinion on this play or on instant replay in general?&nbsp; I'm sure eventually the Cubs will have an instant replay call go their way.</p>
