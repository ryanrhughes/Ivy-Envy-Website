    who couldn't sell books without ratting out his peers.  Sure his peers were using,
    but it was their responsibility to come forward and admit it, not his.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Forgive my non-Cubs related post today. &nbsp;But honestly, do you WANT to read about yesterday's 13-3 loss to the Marlins?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was able to attend a Dodgers vs. Angels game in Anaheim. &nbsp;I spoke a bit about this on the podcast and wanted to share a few photos from the game.</p>
<p>While I know a few very nice Dodgers fans, for the most part, their fan base holds the title of the worst fanbase in the world (according to me). &nbsp;They are an awful group. &nbsp;If you think the White Sox fan base is bad, go to a Cubs/Dodgers game in LA and wear a Cubs shirt. &nbsp;Last year, we had my friend, Gus, (Dodgers season ticket holder) on the podcast and he agreed with about all of my opinions on fan base. &nbsp;Because of my experiences, the Giants fan beat-down earlier this year did not surprise me at all.</p>
<p>My father-in-law (life-long Southern Californian) said that Dodger Stadium is probably the safest place in LA because of the police presence in response to that incident. &nbsp;When my mother-in-law aked "Gene has tickets to a Dodgers/Angels game, do you want to go?" &nbsp;My first response was "Is it in LA or Anaheim?" &nbsp;Her answer was "Anaheim", so I was down. &nbsp; I don't care how "safe" Dodger Stadium is now, I don't want to go back.</p>
<p>Angel Stadium is an great venue. &nbsp;I love watching ballgames there. &nbsp;While built in a fairly boring stadium era, the Angels have done a great job with upgrades. &nbsp;They've also done a lot to make it a fan-friendly joint. &nbsp;Their team shops have great prices, with adult t-shirts as low as $10 and hats as low as $7.50. &nbsp;They also have lots of food options. &nbsp;I got a huge container (could easily feed 2) of Panda Express for $8. &nbsp;I am not well versed in the world of the Angels, but I think it's this kind of fan-centered policies that probably eased the tension of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim name-change. &nbsp;In 2009, the Angels were ranked the most fan-friendly of the 122 pro sports organizations.</p>
<p>I would say the fans were split 50-50 or maybe 60-40 favoring the Angels. Overall, the Dodgers crowd was pretty typical. &nbsp;They were loud, obnoxious and borderline intimidating. &nbsp;We had some mellow Dodgers fans sitting in front of us, so it was a pleasant experience at "The Big A" for myself and members of my family. &nbsp;If you follow us on Twitter, during the game, I sent out the following photo with the caption "Dodgers Fan Hat-Fail".</p>

Ivy Envy writer, Jimmy, was on the ball and quickly revised the photo.</p>

<p>Here are a few more photos. &nbsp;It was a typical beautiful Southern California evening.</p>

<p>Earlier in the season, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5218" target="_blank">I wrote a post</a> about the Angels giving away Lucha Libre wrestling masks. &nbsp;This put his on for the final out of the game. &nbsp;I like the tradition he's started more than "Go Cubs Go".</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Angels-Lucha-Libre.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5657" title="Angels Lucha Libre Mask" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Angels-Lucha-Libre-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></center></p>
<p>Before the game, I was walking around the stadium with my brother-in-law, Jay. &nbsp;While on the outfield concourse, we saw this sign:</p>
<p></center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1108.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5658" title="Jose Canseco HR Derby" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_1108-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></center></p>
<p>That's right, after the game, there would be a Homerun Derby between Angels legend, Tim Salmon, and Jose Canseco. &nbsp;At the both time, we both said "We are staying for this." &nbsp;Sure enough, after the game, out wandered Jose Canseco.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Jose-Canseco.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5659" title="Jose Canseco" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Jose-Canseco-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a></center></p>
<p>This was a softball HR Derby, but as it turns out, Jose Canseco can still hit the hell out of the ball. &nbsp;Sure, the pitches are being lobbed in and everything, but his swing was pretty fierce. &nbsp;Here's a video I took of Canseco practicing. &nbsp;Notice the "warm reception" Canseco receives when he was announced. &nbsp;I also noticed that, the whole time, he was being ignored by the other former players on the field.</p>

<p>It was a good night at Angel Stadium. &nbsp;It was cool to be able to spend some time with the guys of the family and take in a game.  I've said this before, but if you get the chance to take in a game there, you won't be disappointed. </p>
