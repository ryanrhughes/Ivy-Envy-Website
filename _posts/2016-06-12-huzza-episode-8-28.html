We start this episode off by looking at the 2016 MLB draft and the Cubs strategy with the draft.  We talk about trade rumors that have surfaced and share some advice on considering the credibility of reports.  </p>
<p>The Cubs made one trade this week by bringing back Chris Coghlan.  We briefly talk about this move.  The Cubs beat the Braves 2 games to 1 this weekend and we talk about a couple of topics from the series.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener questions and talk about the incredible defense the Cubs have played in 2016...outside of today's game.  Kurt has a scary stat and we have a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
