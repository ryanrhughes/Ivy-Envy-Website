<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt wrap up the 2012 season in this episode.  Darwin Barney makes his way into the MLB record books by tying the record for most consecutive errorless games at 2nd base.  We discuss this accomplishment, our opinions on Barney and his future with this team and in the major leagues.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are flirting with their first 100 loss season since 1966.  But really, does it matter if they lose 99 or 102?  What's the difference?  </p>
<p>Since the Cubs traveled to Colorado this week, we re-visit the Tyler Colvin trade and tell you if we regret that trade.  </p>
<p>As the 2012 season wraps up, we start looking ahead to the off-season.  The Cubs front office will sit down with Dale Sveum on Thursday to evaluate the players and determine who will be with the team in the 2013 season.  Also, the Cubs are reportedly going to spend some money on pitching in the off-season and we discuss what the Cubs plans may be over the next five months.  </p>
<p>Logan Watkins is names the organization's Minor League Player of the Year and Nick Struck is named the Pitcher of the Year.  We look at their stats for the year and comment on these players and the awards.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.
