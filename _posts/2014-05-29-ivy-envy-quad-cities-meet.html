  content: One thing I have been noticing about some pictures and whatnot are that
    you need to change the privacy settings to Public so more people can see it and
    share it better.

  content: yeah, that's annoying. Also why you should always ask others to share it
    instead of just liking. A quick "Please Share This With Your Friends" tag-line
    should be on all your posts. It will just remind others to help you out.

  content: Yeah, I don't want to come across as pushy.  I figure if you create content
    worth sharing, people will share it.  I see what you're saying, though.

  content: People don't see it as pushy. Your fans know you are trying to reach as
    many people as possible and many of them would like to help you, but they need
    reminding. Now, if you tell them they are just being A-Holes if they don't share,
    that might come across wrong.
