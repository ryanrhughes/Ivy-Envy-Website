<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />What a great time to be a Cubs fan.  The Cubs just beat the Cardinals in a series in St. Louis. It's the 14th of September and the Cubs are about to lock up the NL Central. The future is bright and we're having a blast.  </p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about Kyle Hendricks and his near no-no.  This leads to a discussion about Joe West and how, because of his actions, he is bad for baseball.  We get you caught up on the news in the last week of Cubs baseball.  Jason McLeod may be on his way out of the organization, Javy is the emergency catcher if the Cubs carry 2 catchers in the playoffs.  Andy addresses the claim that Kris Bryant is not "clutch".  </p>
<p>There's lots to discuss in this episode and we think you'll enjoy it.  </p>
