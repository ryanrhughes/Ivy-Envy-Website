  content: Spoken like a true Flubs fan.  BP should not have ran his mouth but come
    on.   Votto's comments were in jest...or did you fail to read that part of the
    story?  Good luck next year.  Maybe the Flubs will win 65 games.  Nice series
    this past weekend, by the way.

    believe they will melt down in any sort of race to the finish.\"\r\n\r\nYou mean
    they will melt down the same way the Cubs have for the past 100+ years?"

    a winning season or finished better than 3rd place in 10 years.

    about right...1908, bro.  1908.

    was trying to say is that when September rolls around there's not a whole lot
    of pennant race experience on that team.  \r\n\r\nAnd they're annoying.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

    I have a lot of friends in the Cincinnati area.  But this year they have been
    much more cocky.  Votto was flying under the radar for a while but that comment
    about Byrd kind of blew his humbleness quotient.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: Again, if you go back and look at the reports, it was totally in jest.  He
    meant it about the Cubs fans, not the Cub players.  I've been to well over 200
    games at Riverfront/Cinergy/GABP.   By far, the most rude and obnoxious
    fans are from the Mets and Cubs.  No other team's fans are even close.  Not even
    Phillies fans.

    by almost every account in sports history,  Eagles fans are the worst and it's
    not even close.\r\n\r\n\r\nMets fans are assholes because they're from New York
    so they have somewhat of an excuse.\r\n\r\nBut Phillies fans...no we are not nearly
    as hateful (and violent) as Phillies fans.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "I think we should mention that on tonight's show we discussed the Jim
    Edmonds thing and we all pretty much don't remember the media assaulting him like
    he claims.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly honest with you, all I remember was he got the
    standard grief from the die hard fans from coming over from a team that we all
    hate more than anything in the world, but even before the time he hit his first
    home run, all of that disappeared.  \r\n\r\nIt's your standard \"blame the media\"
    card, and it's a crock.  According to these guys the media is responsible for
    when they hit .235, which is ridiculous.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>I never really minded the Reds.&nbsp; When I was 13, I put a Reds sticker on my dirt-bike to support them in their 1990 playoff run and World Series battle with the Bash Brothers and the rest of the Oakland A's.&nbsp; They haven't really been terribly relevant, and so I've had pretty impartial feelings towards them for years.&nbsp; When Dusty Baker was picked up by the Reds, I wanted to see them fail, just because I couldn't stand Dusty Baker.&nbsp; However, in the last month or so, the Reds are possibly becoming my most hated team in the division.</p>
<p>The Reds have become a cocky and outspoken team.&nbsp; There is a gray area of cocky and whiny and these Reds fall somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>After the All-Star game, we awarded Joey Votto with our <strong>Asshat of the Week </strong>award for his comments about the Cubs and Marlon Byrd after Byrd's efforts to help the National League win home-field advantage, from which the Reds could possibly benefit.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don't like the Cubs.&nbsp; And I'm not going to pat anybody with a Cubs uniform on the back.</blockquote><br />
You might be curious what Votto did to assist the NL in securing home-field advantage in the World Series.  He went 0-2 at the plate.</p>
<p>But that's old news.  Reds players have been in the news twice this week for their statements.  This week, the Reds acquired Jim Edmonds to assist him in his tour of the NL Central - 4 teams down, 2 to go.  Edmonds was asked if fans would warm up to him in Cincinnati and responded with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>As long as it&rsquo;s not as bad as it was in Chicago, I&rsquo;ll be all right. The media killed me in Chicago for the first three weeks until I hit my first home run.</blockquote><br />
Now I'll admit that I don't have the most fresh memory, but for the life of me, I don't recall the media or fans in Chicago killing Jim Edmonds, literally or figuratively.  Many fans had mixed feelings based on his years in St. Louis, but I don't recall anyone being that difficult on him.  He actually became a player I had positive feelings about, based on his effort, despite his declining skills.  I posed the following question on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a>:  Does Edmonds think that to fit in at Cincy, you need to have an inferiority complex towards Chicago and the Cubs?</p>
<p>And then Brandon Phillips joined the party on Monday with his comments on the Cardinals.</p>
<blockquote><p>I'd play against these guys with one leg. We have to beat these guys.  I hate the Cardinals. All they do is bitch and moan about everything, all of them. ... I really hate the Cardinals. Compared to the Cardinals, I love the Chicago Cubs. Let me make this clear: I hate the Cardinals.</blockquote><br />
The Cardinals were none to happy with these comments and Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina let Phillips know how he felt as Phillips came to the plate in his first at-bat in Tuesday night's game.  This led to the clearing of both benches and ejections of the two managers.</p>
<p>Since the Cubs are out of post-season contention and although I am definitely no fan of the Cardinals, I am rooting for them to destroy these mouth-breathers from <del datetime="2010-08-11T00:49:43+00:00">Cincinnati</del> Northern Kentucky.&nbsp; They apparently can not handle four months of winning baseball and I believe they will melt down in any sort of race to the finish.&nbsp; They exhibit the inability to keep their cool and control themselves.</p>
