  content: Rangers fans must hate the Cubs. Jon Daniels openly talks about the pain
    of the Garza deal. They were reportedly interested in&nbsp;Kottaras to fill in
    for an injured Geovany Soto (but didn't claim him). Then snag Donnie Murphy to
    fill a spot Mike Olt would have been ready for. That stings.

<p>In a move that pretty much indicates that Mike Olt will be the starting third baseman with the Chicago Cubs rather than Iowa, the Rangers have claimed Donnie Murphy off waivers.  With Luis Valbuena and Emilio Bonafacio performing fairly well this spring, it seemed that Murphy would probably be the odd man out.  </p>
<p>Murphy was a bit of a pleasant surprise hitting .255/.319/.530, but it was the uptick in power that led to Murphy finding his way into the lineup.  Murphy had career high numbers with 11 HR and 23 RBIs.  The departure of Murphy means the departure of his salary, $825,000.  Murphy performed better than I ever expected him to, but I definitely prefer the alternatives over him in 2014.  </p>

<p>This unexpected move leaves the backup catcher position to either John Baker or Eli Whiteside.  </p>
<p>It's safe to say these next four or five days could be pretty active for the Cubs, roster-wise.  </p>
