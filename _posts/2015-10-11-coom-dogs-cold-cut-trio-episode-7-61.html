<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we recap the first two Cubs/Cardinals games in the 2015 NLDS.  Game 1 didn't go as planned and we share our thoughts on why the Cardinals were able to take a game from Jon Lester.  </p>
<p>The three of us were able to attend Game #2 in St. Louis on Saturday.  The majority of the episode is our experiences and takes on what we saw.  We have some personal stories from our interactions with "the best fans in baseball".  </p>
<p>We look ahead to Game #3 and look at the pitching match-ups.  We will record a live post-game show after Game #3.  You can watch it on Blab right after the game.  If you're not on Blab, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/live</a> and click on the link.  </p>
