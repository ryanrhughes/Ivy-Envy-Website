  content: "That was a great fun episode! Great idea to interview your daughter. \nMy
    opinion is I'll wait and see; give Clark a chance. But I would have liked to see
    a mascot that can appeal to ALL ages. For example, in Denver which is where I
    live, Dinger, the mascot for the Colorado Rockies, I think does. I would not be
    embarrassed to get my picture taken with Dinger.  With Clark, I'm not sure."

    Ya know, I kinda had fun with the some of the stuff people were doing to rip on Clark, until it got to be disturbing. &nbsp;I listened to this podcast and it reminded me of the point that he's for kids, not for the Twitter haters (who gonna hate).

    As an aside, my son (7) and I were working on his Pinewood Derby car. &nbsp;We had set out some newspapers to paint on (like 2 hours after I listened to this episode). &nbsp;Unprompted, he saw Clark's picture on the newspaper and said "and I can't wait to go to Wrigley Field this year now that they've got a mascot!" &nbsp;

    Again, get over it. &nbsp;If you're checking on the stuff on Deadspin or if you can name any employee from the Cubs' front office, then Clark is not meant to make *you* happy.

Twitter freaked out and Deadspin grossed us out. We will surely talk about this on our regular podcast episode this Sunday, but I figured it would make sense to talk with the demographic this mascot is geared towards. So I sat down for a quick conversation with my 6-year old daughter.<br />
We talk about Clark the Cub, mascots in general, her thoughts on Wrigley Field and her favorite player. If you have kids, I am interested in hearing what their thoughts are on Clark the Cub. I'd also like to hear your opinions.
