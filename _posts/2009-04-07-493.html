  content: "When I lived in Long Beach, I never felt like I could hang the flag after
    a Cubs victory because I thought everyone would assume I was a supporter of George
    W. Bush.\r\n\r\nI don't think many people there would see a \"W\" flag and assume
    it meant the Cubs won."

  content: "It would be great if people also assumed you only supported him on certain
    days and kept trying to figure out \"What did that genius do today that he's so
    excited about?\"\r\n\r\nMaybe we could find a big \"O\" flag."
