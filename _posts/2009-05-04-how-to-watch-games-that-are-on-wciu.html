    it.  I will soon give up and listen to Ron and his non-analysis.

  content: "As the first inning finally came a close with Reed Johnson leaving the
    bases loaded, I clicked refresh to see where the game is now.  \r\n\r\nIt was
    magically the top of the 3rd inning.\r\nHowever, now it's not nearly as choppy."

  content: I may subscribe to gameday audio so I can listen to the  broadcasts. Right
    now I am watching at school so it's pretty good quality. If there is a game next
    saturday I can watch it in class.

    for free.\r\n\r\nWhen we're out in CA this summer, I'm going to subscribe to the
    MLB.com tv thing so I can see the non-WGN games.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome over in
    Fountain Valley to watch the games with me anytime."

<p>For those of you that are outside Chicago, but for some reason declared in the "Chicago market" by the powers that be, Cubs games that are televised on WCIU are very frustrating.&nbsp; Last time I checked, over-the-air antennas in Bloomington, Moline and Des Moines could not pick up Chicago stations.&nbsp; We discussed this on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=752">Saturday's episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to find a way for you all to watch tonight's game with the Giants.&nbsp; It appears that I may have accomplished that goal.</p>
<p>I tested it on a few other games and it seems to work.&nbsp; If it looks messed up at first, hang with it.&nbsp; I'm guessing that it will run more smoothly if you have a fast internet connection.</p>
<p>Go to:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hdlounge.net/">http://www.hdlounge.net/</a></p>
<p>Click on the "Channel 4" tab.</p>
<p>If it does not work, click on the Troubleshoot Guide.</p>
<p>Then just follow the directions and download the plug-in.<br />
***Edit***  I think Troubleshooting Guide will come up prior to the gametime.  Try again when the game is starting.<br />
I just followed the prompts and it appears to be working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully this allows you to enjoy tonight's game.</p>
