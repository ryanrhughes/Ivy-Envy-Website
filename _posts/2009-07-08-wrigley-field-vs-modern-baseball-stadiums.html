  content: '"I love the lack of artificial visual and auditory stimulation."  I love
    that about Wrigley as well.  This is a good post.  We have to enjoy Wrigley while
    we can because it will go away in our lifetime.  I also like watching Cubs games
    at home so I can get out my own "rally monkey."'

<p>Last night, I went to see the Angels play the Rangers at Angel Stadium.&nbsp; Although I would consider my 2nd favorite team to be the Angels, the distance between them and the Cubs is great.&nbsp; I don't know much about their players and I merely glance at their scores in the paper.&nbsp; They were a major reason I decided to subscribe to MLB Extra Innings this year, but I find it difficult to stay up for West Coast games after chasing two little kids around all evening.&nbsp; However, if I ever build up the guts to kick the Cubs to the curb (like I've threatened many times), the Angels would be high on the list of replacements.</p>
<p>Although from the exterior, Angel Stadium is a bland, cookie-cutter ballpark, they have done a lot to give the inside of the stadium some character.&nbsp; It does not feel cookie-cutter on the inside and although there is nothing specific to look at, the view from the stadium is pretty nice, especially for a smaller-town Midwest guy that isn't used to seeing big freeways, mountains and palm trees.&nbsp; I find it hard to appreciate a stadium that blasts music over the PA.&nbsp; Commercials between the innings don't feel real natural to me.&nbsp; I know baseball well enough to know when I should cheer, although some fans apparently need a jumbo-tron to tell them.&nbsp; But that's common in baseball now.&nbsp; After watching one of the Angels players get tagged out in a run-down and hearing a sizeable amount of fans cheering afterward because the play was exciting, I understood why sometimes they may need to be reminded of when to cheer on a massive screen.</p>
<p>Some folks are down on Wrigley.&nbsp; I understand their reasons.&nbsp; They claim it's the world's largest bar or that fans would rather talk on their cell phones than watch the game.&nbsp; I saw the same level of interest at this Angels game.&nbsp; There are fans there for the game and there are fans there to socialize.&nbsp; The Cubs have what we see every game we watch or go to, the Angels have fans that do the wave or cheer when the beach ball bouncing around the section is kept from the security guard.</p>
<p>I also think that just because you see someone in a Cubs shirt on tv acting a little douchey at the game, doesn't necessarily mean they are a Cubs fan.&nbsp; To most of the country, Wrigley is a museum and the Cubs are a novelty.&nbsp; Any family trip through Chicago has a male in the family begging for a stop at Wrigley Field.&nbsp; A stop in a Wrigleyville t-shirt shop and a seat at Wrigley does not make someone a Cubs fan.&nbsp; I have sat around many people at Wrigley decked out in Cubs gear that don't know a thing about the team.&nbsp; Those are the people on their phones telling all their buddies stuck behind their desks in Chattanooga that they are at the Friendly Confines.&nbsp; At least that's what I'd like to think.</p>
<p>I love Wrigley Field.&nbsp; I love the organ.&nbsp; I love being able to clearly see the scores of divisional opponents.&nbsp; I love the lack of artificial visual and auditory stimulation.&nbsp; I want to be able to geek out with my scorecard and not get distracted by fireworks or "Who let the dogs out".</p>
<p>But last night at the Angels game, I had to put aside my MLB stadium standards and enjoy a good modern-baseball stadium.&nbsp; I would be kidding myself if I thought that at some point in my life, a stadium that the Cubs call home won't end up just like the rest.&nbsp; There are a lot of stadiums much worse than Angels Stadium.&nbsp; It's a nice ballpark and sometimes you need to loosen your expectations a little.&nbsp; I'm just really grateful that we left last night's game a little early to grab a bite to eat and didn't have to experience the Rally Monkey on the jumbotron.</p>
