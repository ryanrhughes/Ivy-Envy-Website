<p><strong>The Cubs entered the series 7-8 and ended the series 9-9</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Padres entered the series 7-8 and ended the series 8-10.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_18_sdnmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">Monday, April 18th--Cubs 1, Padres 0 (10 innings)</a></p>
<p>This game was broadcast on WCIU.&nbsp; Listening to the game on the radio was fine, but it would've been cool to watch Zambrano's 10-strikeout performance live.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to settle for <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_18_sdnmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">the video highlights</a> the next day.&nbsp; Despite the frigid temperature at Wrigley (34 degrees + 12 mph wind at game time), Zambrano went deep into this game, pitching eight strong innings.&nbsp; However, the Cubs offense was unable to take advantage of Z's start--Padres' starter Tim Stauffer blanked them through seven innings of work.&nbsp; It took ten innings and a pinch-hit double by Tyler Colvin to win this game.&nbsp; We have been bagging on Colvin a lot lately, so it was nice to actually see him get a clutch hit for once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday, April 19th--PPD due to ridiculous weather.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ice-bat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5089" title="ice bat" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/ice-bat.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="280" /></a></p><br />

<p>Wednesday, April 20th--<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_20_sdnmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">Game 1: Cubs 2, Padres 1 (11 innings)</a>; <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_20_sdnmlb_chnmlb_2&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">Game 2: Padres 5, Cubs 4</a></p>
<p>Tuesday's gelid weather forced a Wednesday double header, and unfortunately, the weather wasn't that much better on Wednesday.&nbsp; I tuned into game one just in time to see Reed Johnson hit his walk-off homer.&nbsp; Johnson later talked about the Padres' Gregerson being basically a two-pitch pitcher, and he correctly predicted a slider with a 1-1 count.&nbsp; This guy is a smart, hard-playing player who is hard not to like.&nbsp; <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_20_sdnmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">Take a look at the replay</a> and watch him fly out of the box after he hits this ball.&nbsp; The video is also worth watching for the commentators' reactions; Brenly lets out a Santo-esque shout.&nbsp; Also, at about 25 seconds in, look for Samardzija's amazing celebratory ballet-kick.&nbsp; The other good news from this game is that Garza finally had a strong outing.&nbsp; He pitched six scoreless innings and struck out nine.</p>
<p>Game two didn't go as well for the Cubs.&nbsp; It had already been a long day, and the Cubs were looking for James Russell to pitch as deep into the game as possible.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Russell gave up four earned runs and only pitched four innings.&nbsp; Former Bronson Arroyo groupie, Aaron Harang, pitched well for the Dads Club.&nbsp; He earned the win to get to 4-0 on the season.&nbsp; He also loves to eat bamboo.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Harang-Koala.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5092" title="Harang-Koala" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Harang-Koala-300x109.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="109" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Soriano hit a two-run homer late in the game to make it close, but the Cubs just couldn't finish the rally.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Up Next</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Dodgers Carnival rolls into Chicago for a three-game series with the Cubs.&nbsp; We here at Ivy Envy are really looking forward to Saturday's Dempster-Lilly matchup, but Kurt said he is more interested in seeing Aaron Miles back in Chicago.&nbsp; Hopefully Ted Lilly's next paycheck doesn't bounce.&nbsp; We might have to pass a hat around for him at the next live event.<strong><br />
