<p>In June, the Cubs went 10-16.&nbsp; Their overall record is 34-45, 11 games under .500 a week and a half before the All-Star break.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.waxpaperbeercup.com" target="_self">Wax Paper Beer Cup</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/wpbc" target="_blank">via Twitter</a>) pointed out today that they are on track to win fewer than 70 games this season.&nbsp; I could go on and on with everything wrong with this team.&nbsp; But what pops into my e-mail inbox multiple times a day?&nbsp; An e-mail from the Cubs <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">encouraging</span> begging me to vote for these guys to go to the All-Star Game.&nbsp; And why should I vote for position players that are part of a team that ranked 3rd to last in the league for runs scored in June?&nbsp; Yeah, I'll make sure I vote as many times as MLB allows.</p>
