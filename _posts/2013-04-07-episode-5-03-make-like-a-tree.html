<p>The first week of the 2013 Cubs season is in the books and Carlos Marmol is out as the Cubs closer.  We talk about the events that led to this change.  We go through the three games he was involved in and one of us made a prediction about these three games in our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-01-2013-cubs-season-predictions/" target="_blank">2013 Prediction Episode - Episode 5.01</a>.</p>
<p>While we spent a lot of the episode discussing the ugliness we've witnessed, we also look at the positives we've seen in the first week of the 2013 season.  Jeff Samardzija is mentioned (of course) and we look at what went wrong for him in the Sunday game vs. the Braves.  We've also been impressed with others on the pitching staff.</p>
<p>This week has also been the first chance for lots of Cubs fans to get acquainted with Jim Deshaies and we comment on what we've heard from the Len/JD broadcast duo.  We also have to comment on Carlos Villanueva's facial hair.  </p>
<p>We haven't awarded someone with the "Asshat of the Week" title in years and we dust it off to hand it over to Chipper Jones this week.  The Scary Stat of the Week segment returns after a six month hiatus, but we return to a statistical category that we've spent a lot of time on in previous years.  Then we go through the many entries for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
