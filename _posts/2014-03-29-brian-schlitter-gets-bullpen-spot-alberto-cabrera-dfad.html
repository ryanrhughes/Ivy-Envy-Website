<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Brian+Schlitter+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+PlBzHCIieIsl.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/Brian+Schlitter+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+PlBzHCIieIsl-204x300.jpg" alt="Brian Schlitter" width="204" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9426" /></a>In a move that would not have seemed likely a month ago, the <a href="https://twitter.com/GDubCub" target="_blank">Cubs announced today</a> that <del datetime="2014-03-29T17:26:23+00:00">Johnny Damon</del> Brian Schlitter would start 2014 in the Cubs bullpen.  This leaves Alberto Cabrera out and the Cubs have designated Cabrera for assignment.  </p>
<p>Schlitter, a Chicago-area native, pitched in eight games this spring.  After posting a 2.08 ERA with 9 strikeouts and 1 walk, the Cubs liked what they saw and gave him a spot in a bullpen that had many options.  </p>
<p>Schlitter has been in the Cubs organization since 2008 and besides 7 appearances with the big league team in 2010, he has been in the minors.  Schlitter spent time with Tennessee and Iowa in 2013 and pitched well.  In 54 appearances, he had a 2.42 ERA and 22 saves.  </p>
<p>Alberto Cabrera, on the other hand, did not look so sharp during Spring Training.  With 10<sup>1/3</sup> innings pitched in 8 appearances, Cabrera had a 6.97  ERA, giving up 8 earned runs and 3 home runs.  The Cubs will have 10 days to either trade, release or waive Cabrera.  If the team places him on waviers and he clears, Cabrera could be sent to Iowa.  </p>
