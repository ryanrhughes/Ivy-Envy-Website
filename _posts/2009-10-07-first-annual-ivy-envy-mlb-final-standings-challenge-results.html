<p>After an incredible 163<sup>rd</sup> game between the Twins and the Tigers, the 2009 regular season is over.<span> </span>That means it&rsquo;s time to compare scores for the First Annual Ivy Envy MLB Season Standings Predictions.<span> </span>Here are the results:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Corey &ndash;      24 points</li>
<li><strong>Tie</strong> -&nbsp; Kurt&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; John      (<a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a>) &ndash; 26 points</li>
<li>Andy &ndash;      28 points</li>
<li>Matt      Veto (Moline Dispatch/Rock Island Arugs) &ndash; 32 points</li>
<li>Jim &ndash;      38 points</li><br />
</ol><br />
There were three perfect divisions.&nbsp; Kurt and Corey aced the AL East and John aced the AL West.<span> </span></p>
<p>The winner for the worst single pick is Matt Veto.<span> </span>Matt picked the Arizona Diamondbacks to win the NL West.<span> </span>If you weren&rsquo;t aware, the D-backs finished in last place.</p>
<p>We will do this again next season and it is open to anyone.<span> </span>The winner is named Emperor of Ivy Envy and responsible for paying all domain and hosting fees.</p>
