<p>If you didn't get a chance to hear it, Von Joshua was interviewed during the pre-game show on WGN radio.&nbsp; He was surprisingly blunt and honest, which is quite refreshing compared to the way Lou Piniella is handling the situation.&nbsp; Oh yeah, remember the changes Lou said he would be forced to make?&nbsp; Apparently the big change is to have Andres Blanco at 2nd rather than Aaron Miles.&nbsp; Yeah, that should mix things up and get the offense going.</p>
<p>Anyway, Joshua said that the club looks "very very lost" and he stated that he feels most of the club is going up swinging for the fences and trying pull the ball.&nbsp; He seemed to be directing that at the younger guys and singled out Soto and Theriot.&nbsp; He said that his goal is to have "good hitters with power".&nbsp; He said that he told Theriot that he got where he is by poking the ball through the holes and hitting line-drives and that if he gets a good pitch to turn on, go ahead.&nbsp; When asked about Fukudome, he said the biggest thing he's noticed is that his timing with his front foot seems to be a little bit off and he needs to have his front foot planted before he connects with the ball.</p>
