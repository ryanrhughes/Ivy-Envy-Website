excerpt: I spent some time with Manstrength today and we were discussing the Cubs
  pitching today.&nbsp; If you haven't gathered, he's much more of an optimistic Cubs
  fan than I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitching scares me more than it bothers him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    He's played the Cubs real well the last few years.  I'd take him.

    I think the guys on the trading block for the Cubs are:
    Matt Murton, Mike Fontenot and maybe Ronny Cedeno.

    It'd be kind of a bad thing to let Cedeno go when he is showing so much potential, but this is probably when you could get the most for him.  I can't see getting much in the way of a pitcher for Murton and Fontenot.

<p>I spent some time with Manstrength today and we were discussing the Cubs pitching today.&nbsp; If you haven't gathered, he's much more of an optimistic Cubs fan than I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitching scares me more than it bothers him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a id="more"></a><a id="more-65"></a></p>
<p>Let's have a discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think?&nbsp; How are you feeling about the Cubs pitching?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it's time to trade for some solid pitching?&nbsp; Who's leaving the North Side if a trade needs to happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; Are teams ready to sell off players or is it too early for some of these teams to throw in the towel?</p>
<p>We want to hear from you, mystery readers.&nbsp;</p>
