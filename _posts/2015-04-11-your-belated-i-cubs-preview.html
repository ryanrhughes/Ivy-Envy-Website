    john lester is quite possibly the best&nbsp; SP-3&nbsp; in the majors .


    cubs should put&nbsp; 25 cent coin slots on those port-o-johns&nbsp; , and go out and get
    two of&nbsp; price / cueto&nbsp; / zimmerman&nbsp; for the 2016 season .

    I agree..."Well done". &nbsp;Over the years I have personally learned and continue to learn about players, trades and MLB from Sean. &nbsp;Keep up the good work....

<p>This is a little late as the I-Cubs are already three games into their season, but for at least the next month, the Iowa Cubs will again boast the most exciting roster in MiLB. The talent roaming the infield is unmatched with three guys poised to terrorize Pacific Coast League pitching in Bryant, Baez, Russell (all have been named top-5 prospects in baseball within the last two years) until Chicago and the Big Leagues come calling.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much left unsaid about All-World third baseman <strong>Kris Bryant</strong> at this point, but he is a must-see talent in PCL action until <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">service time rules are satisfied</span> he gets enough defensive reps at the hot corner and in left field to be &lsquo;Big League Ready.' Once he's called up, it wont be long before&nbsp;you're checking this <a title="page" href="http://krisbryanthomeruns.com/" target="_blank">page</a> daily.</p>
<p>The length of <strong>Javier Baez</strong>&rsquo; return trip to Des Moines will be dependent on his ability to improve the contact issues that led to him batting well under the Mendoza Line during his stint in The Show last year. The other tools are all where they need to be but until the hit tool comes around, the speed, power, and glove will be on display at Principal Park instead of Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>This spring, <strong>Addison Russell</strong> showed that he is ready to man shortstop at the big league level now, but he&rsquo;ll refine his game in AAA until trade or injury open a spot for him in Chicago.</p>
<p>The Iowa infield will be rounded out by organizational depth in <strong>Jonathan Mota</strong> and <strong>Chris Valiaka</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the outfield, <strong>Junior Lake</strong> is the headliner for now and he will look to continue the progress he made over the winter in regards to plate discipline and pitch recognition in the hopes that this development will allow him to reach some of his yet untapped potential. Other outfielders will include <strong>John Andreoli </strong>and <strong>Rubi Silva</strong>, plus depth guys in <strong>Mike Baxter</strong> and <strong>Adron Chambers</strong>. More prospecty excitement is on the way to Iowa in short order with CF Albert Almora and LF (and part-time catcher) Kyle Schwarber tabbed as short-timers for Tennessee.</p>
<p>Speaking of catchers, <strong>Rafael Lopez </strong> won&rsquo;t offer a ton by way of the bat but he has a major-league-caliber glove and is ready whenever the Cubs may call upon him. He will be backed-up by <strong>Taylor Davis</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Pierce Johnson</strong> and <strong>Eric Jokisch</strong>, both pitchers capable of having Kyle Hendricks-esque seasons, if things break right, headline the arms in Iowa to start the year. Johnson wields more upside, but Jokisch has the polish to fill in for Chicago now if they develop a need. <strong>Zac Rosscup </strong>is a reliever who pitched well enough this spring to earn an MLB bullpen spot but the roster just didn&rsquo;t shake out in his favor, though he will be up before long.</p>
<p><strong>Armando Rivera</strong> is yet another power arm who may well be the heir to &lsquo;Closer of the Future&rsquo; title, though guys like Neil Ramirez, Hector Rondon, and Justin Grimm aren&rsquo;t going anywhere soon. Either way, the train of high leverage RHP coming from the Chicago bullpen won&rsquo;t be slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<p><strong>Drake Britton</strong> is another former Oriole pitcher who the Cubs hope to turn into the player scouts hoped he would be, and although Jake Arrieta he is not, Britton has a chance to be a quality big league arm.</p>
<p>Other intriguing pitchers include <strong>Blake Parker, Joe Ortiz, Carlos Pimintel and Barret Loux</strong> but once again there is more fire-power on the way- CJ Edwards is starting his 2015 campaign in AA, but will be joining the squad in Iowa before long.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s edition of the Iowa Cubs once again looks poised to be the most talked about minor league team in baseball, and even as top names like Bryant, Russell, and Baez graduate, there are high quality prospects in AA-Tennessee who will be champing at the bit to take their places in the minor league spotlight.</p>
