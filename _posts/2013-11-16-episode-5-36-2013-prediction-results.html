<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt are all in studio again and welcome long-time listener and first-time guest host, Michael from Galesburg.  Michael also podcasts and you can find his show on the 1980's at <a href="http://theawesome80s.net/" target="_blank">The Awesome 80's Podcast</a>.</p>
<p>On this episode, we revisit the 2013 predictions we made at the beginning of the season. This was <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-01-2013-cubs-season-predictions/" target="_blank">Episode 5.01</a>.  Also, in this episode, we mention our review of "Marlins Will Soar" and you can find that about halfway through <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-3-30-marlins-will-soar/" target="_blank">Episode 3.30</a>.  </p>
