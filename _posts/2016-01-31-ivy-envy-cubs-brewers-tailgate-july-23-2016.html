This event will be replacing our bus trip to Wrigley in 2016.  </p>
<p>Miller Park opens their parking lot 3 hours before first pitch and allows tailgating.  We will have a reserved tailgating area.</p>
<p>Tickets must be purchased by Friday, February 12<sup>th</sup>.  You can purchase yours through the Paypal button below.  Your $30 purchase includes a ticket to the Cubs vs Brewers game.  </p>
<p>While this event is replacing the Ivy Envy bus trip, we will not be renting a bus. You're responsible for your own transportation.  And after the game, please transport yourself responsibly.  </p>
<p><strong><u><center> Tickets are no longer available for this event.  It sold out.</strong></u></center></p>
