<p>Tim Sheridan, the public address announcer at Hohokam Stadium, took us on a behind the scenes tour of Hohokam Stadium. Hohokam Stadium has been the Spring home of the Cubs since it was completed in 1997. The Cubs and the city of Mesa are working towards building a new facility within the next five years.</p>
