<p><a href="/uploads/2014/04/Emilio+Bonifacio+Arizona+Diamondbacks+v+Chicago+PG9UPJ4oZY4l.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/04/Emilio+Bonifacio+Arizona+Diamondbacks+v+Chicago+PG9UPJ4oZY4l-210x300.jpg" alt="Emilio Bonafacio" width="210" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9649" /></a>As the Cubs lost last night for a fifth time in their first seven games, everyone tries to find out what the bright spots of the season are so far. Sure the starting pitching has been fantastic, excluding Edwin Jackson's start last night, and the confidence being back for stars, like Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro,are fantastic starting points for a young season. But when looking up and down the Cubs lineup, one name stands out as a breakout star over the last week or so. And his new nickname is Super Emilio 64.</p>
<p>For those not recognizing that nickname, it is Cubs super utility man Emilio Bonifacio. The nickname stirs from "Super Mario 64", the old Nintendo game, but replaced with Emilio. The 64 stays because that is what number he is. It fits perfectly.</p>
<p>Bonifacio, acquired in February after the Royals released him, has gotten off to a scorching start. After a 3-5 performance last night, Bonifacio is leading the league with 17 hits and a .515 average. If those numbers don't impress you (they should) he has accumulated already 0.6 WAR prior to last nights game. His WAR last year with the Marlins and Royals last year? 0.6. Also, his OPS of 1.131 is in the top 10 in the National League.</p>
<p>The key to his early season success? Getting on base and having better plate discipline. His .556 OBP is tops in the NL and third in baseball. Also, his strikeout rate is down from his career average and his walk rate is up. Even without the base hits, he is still getting on base and causing havoc. &nbsp;He is a perfect 5/5 in stolen base attempts, which leads MLB, and gives the Cubs a productive top of the order hitter who can score runs, which he is near the top of the leader board in that category too.</p>
<p>Now, Bonifacio won't hit .515 for the entire year (wouldn't that be nice), but he does look very comfortable in the lead-off spot. Manager Rick Renteria has slotted Emilio in center field and second base just to get him in the lineup everyday. The Cubs haven't had a prototypical lead-off hitter since Juan Pierre back in 2006, and he led the league in hits that year. Now, am I saying Bonifacio will lead the league in hit? No. But he does bring an element to the Cubs offense that has been lacking the past couple years. If Bonifacio can hit around .280, steal 35-40 bags, and continue to get on base at a decent clip, he is going to have a big year. The Cubs lineup just has to drive him in.</p>
