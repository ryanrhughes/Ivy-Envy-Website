<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt are joined for our first live broadcast in a while.  If you would like to see these, they will be archived on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RelentlessPodcasts/videos" target="_blank">Relentless Podcast Network YouTube page</a>.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about Ron Santo's induction into the Hall of Fame.  We look back on his life and career and comment on what stands out and what is most impressive.  </p>
<p>The Cubs hit a brick wall in St. Louis and their recent "tear" was ended by the Cardinals.  We talk about the Cardinals series and how it will effect the way some Cubs fans will see this team.  This episode has a lot of pitching talk, with the trade rumors with Dempster and Garza swirling.  We talk about the impact these trades would have on the team, and who would become the ace of the staff.</p>
<p>Then, we take a look at some of the topics and questions given to us from listeners.  Some of the topics include:  Trades, Harry Caray impressions, the idea of the Cubs re-signing Dempster in 2013 and the 2013 starting rotation.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a scary stat of historic proportions.  Then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
