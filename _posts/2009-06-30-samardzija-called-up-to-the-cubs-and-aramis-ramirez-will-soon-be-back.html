<p>Former Notre Dame standout wide receiver, Jeff Samardzija, was called up to the big leagues again today.&nbsp; I am a huge ND and Samardzija fan.&nbsp; That said, I hate seeing him called up to the Cubs as a reliever.&nbsp; He's being groomed to be a starter and I'd like to see him get comfortable and successful in that role and I'm not sure these quick little stints in the majors are beneficial to him.</p>
<p>Also, it looks as though it won't be a real long rehab stint for Aramis Ramirez.&nbsp; Lou said he'd like to have him back for the Atlanta series next week.&nbsp; I've never been a huge Ramirez fan, but it will be really good to see him in that lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if he is tentative in the field and doesn't return to form there, his bat and clutch hitting will be welcome.</p>
