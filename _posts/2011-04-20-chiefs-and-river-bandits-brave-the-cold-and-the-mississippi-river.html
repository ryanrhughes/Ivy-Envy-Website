<p>It would not be a Chiefs road trip to the Quad Cities in April without cold and wet weather.  Tuesday's game was postponed and the two clubs will make up the game in a double-header this afternoon.  I was at Monday's game to see Hayden Simpson make his third professional start.  The Arkansas native took the mound on a chilly 44 degree night, with a brisk wind that always exists by the river in the Spring.  Gripping the ball would be a challenge for anyone Monday night, and it seemed as though all the pitchers struggled with control at times.  </p>
<p>Simpson got his first decision in his pro career, a loss, and gave up four runs, two of them earned, on six hits in his four innings pitched.  It seemed as though Simpson was sticking to fastballs and his 12-6 curveball.  He struck out three and walked two.  He had one wild pitch and had another pitch sail over everyone to the backstop.  A temperature of 44 degrees may not sound that cold, but it was breezy and damp.  I don't know what the wind chill was, but it felt more like the upper 30's.  </p>
<p>Getting to the ballpark was interesting, as the city of Davenport has constructed temporary pedestrian bridges over the floodwaters.  Nearly all of the parking at Modern Woodmen Park is under water.  The river has completely surrounded the stadium.  The flooded area and cold temperatures had a huge impact on attendance.  I counted 61 fans in the stands, but with the people in the restaurant/bar area and the two or three suites that were occupied, I'll be generous and say that there was 100 people there.  </p>
<p>If you are interested in going to today's double-header between the Chiefs and the River Bandits, the first game starts at 12pm.  Austin Kirk will start the first game for the Chiefs and Dallas Beeler will start the second game.  If you are interested in these games, the Bandits are having their Belly Buster deal tomorrow.  For $19, you can watch both games and enjoy all-you-can-eat hot dogs, nachos, popcorn, peanuts and soda.  </p>
<p>I left my camera's memory card at home, so the only photos I have are from my iPod.  Speaking of my iPod, kudos for the Bandits and MWP for having public Wifi.  Kurt, Lana and I were able to keep an eye on the Cubs game via the MLB At-Bat app.  So here are the photos:</p>
