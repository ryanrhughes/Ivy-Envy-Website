<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt finally have Cubs baseball to talk about as Spring Training 2013 is officially underway.  We recap the first four games of Spring Training and key in on some highlights (and lowlights).  </p>
<p>Three of the four infield positions are locked up, but we look at the depth at first base, second base and shortstop.  Then we discuss the cluster that is 3rd base for the 2013 Chicago Cubs.  Ian Stewart, Luis Valbuena and Josh Vitters added together equal a lot of underwhelmed Cubs fans.  What's the status and what direction should the Cubs go?</p>
<p>We have a good number of topics from listeners, including: the front office "playoff" rhetoric, parallels between the Cubs and the Detroit Lions, public funding for professional sports stadiums, Samardzija as the ace of the staff, how quickly the Cubs should trade Matt Garza and Alfonso Soriano, and the fact that the offensive output in Spring Training is coming from guys that will probably start 2013 in the minor league system.  </p>
<p>The Scary Stat of the Week segment returns with a pretty frightening Spring Training Stat.  Kurt reads an Internet Muscle Flex that isn't really a flex, but definitely entertaining.  Then, we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  </p>
