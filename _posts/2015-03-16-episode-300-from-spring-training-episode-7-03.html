After 26 non-stop hours in a Toyota Corolla, Corey and Andy have arrived in Arizona for the Cubs Spring Training.  </p>
<p>This is the first time we have been to Sloan Park and we talk about our impressions of the facility and what we saw both on the back fields and in the Spring Training game vs. the Reds today.  </p>
<p>In the off-seasons, we try to implement changes and new things with IvyEnvy.com and The Ivy Envy Podcast.  We have three items to share with you on the this episode.  </p>
<p>We will be at Spring Training through Thursday evening.  <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Follow us on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Instagram </a> for updates, photos and videos.  </p>
