<p>We have an interview episode for you this week.  On Monday, Andy and Corey sat down and talked with Javier Baez in Peoria.  Baez was the Cubs' first pick, and the 9th overall pick in the 2011 MLB Draft.  Most experts label Baez as the #2 prospect in the Cubs system and his BP and mammoth home runs are attracting attention in the Midwest League.</p>
<p>We will be back next Saturday (July 14th) with a regular episode.  </p>
