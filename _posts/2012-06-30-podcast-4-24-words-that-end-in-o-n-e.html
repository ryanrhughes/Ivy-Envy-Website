<p>Andy, Brian, Bob from Moline and Corey are in Studio "A" for the very last time and Kurt joins us from an undisclosed location in Iowa.  We spend the first little bit of the podcast talking about some changes coming to the podcast.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo is called up to the Cubs and we talk about what we've seen in the first few games.  We also look at the expectations from the fans and how it is impacted by the current state of the organization.  </p>
<p>Marlon Byrd is busted for PED use and suspended 50 games by MLB.  We probably spend a little too much time on the former Cubs player, but steroids and PEDs are an interesting topic in baseball right now.  </p>
<p>Jeff Samardzija has had 5 less-than-stellar outings in a row.  Can he return to his April/May form?  Is this the real Jeff Samardzija?  Is the biggest issue his walks or the fact he is very hittable?  Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week involves Samardzija, so he gives it to us in this segment.  </p>
<p>Travis Wood appears that he could become a serviceable piece of the rotation.  We comment on his recent performances and look back on the trade that brought Wood to the Cubs and sent Sean Marshall to the Reds.</p>
<p>We briefly comment on Randy Wells clearing waivers and going to Iowa.  Then we get to a few listener-submitted questions and topics.  After the break we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
