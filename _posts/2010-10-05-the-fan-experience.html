  content: "Regardless of whether or not it will piss people off or not, and whether
    it's 4 years or 400 years it will eventually happen.  \r\n\r\nThe lower profile
    the team remains for an extended period of time could spark interest in a new
    stadium.  I think at some point fans have to just say \"You know what, it's over...do
    it and make it quick and painless\"...\r\n\r\nI think we are low profile for the
    moment but not quite enough to get this conversation actually going in management
    meetings.  Would you want to be the guy who brought that up?  \"Hey, I think we
    could earn a little bit more scratch if we just up the price of nachos another
    dollar again...Oh, and I think they should tear down Wrigley.  If you need me,
    I'll be at the bulletproof vest store.\"  Of course no one wants to say it, but
    the idea just seems like such a sacriledge it's keeping Chicago from getting a
    ball park that they've really deserved for a while now.  (Especially for all they've
    taken the fans for)\r\n\r\nRyan"

  content: "The White Sox are starting, slowly, but still starting to build restaurants
    around the ballpark. Hopefully they will gentrify that area, but \"Bacardi at
    the Park\" should be interesting. \r\n\r\nIt's too bad about Wrigley. I'm not
    really sure though what the risk is in moving. Can't the stores and bars move
    as well? Set up a second location in Arliington Heights? Brand a Ron Santo hotel
    and Ricketts can rake in the cash! It seems Reinsdorf was a genius in how he used
    the White Sox moving as leverage to get a new stadium (which turned out to be
    very cost-effective)."

<p>Now that the season is officially over and we know that there are only seven teams in all of baseball worse than the Cubs, it's time to move on to complaining about other things we can't control. On our last podcast Paul mentioned that he thinks the Cubs need to get rid of Wrigley field. Paul said later that he expected to be attacked for such a statement and was surprised by the lack of reaction from the rest of us.</p>
<p>I'll admit that I've drank the Wrigley kool-aid for a long time. It has a sense of history and charm that you don't find in other stadiums and that's hard to replicate. If you blow it up, you can't get it back. However, after my experience at the September 25 game against the Cardinals, I'm starting to dislike the taste of kool-aid.</p>
<p>Everyone knows there are a lot of really bad seats at Wrigley. I happened to get lucky enough to get two of them. It was the usual, pole in the face and a busy aisle in front of you seats. If we would have stayed in those seats we may have seen about two innings of the game, and not consecutively. We, of course moved to better seats. My problem is in the fact that after the 40% in added fees the tickets cost over $30 each. x2 + a couple beers and we dropped over $80. You're welcome, Cubs. It's frustrating to me that such seats even exist. Just remove them...or sell them for what they're worth, about $5. When I bought the tickets the day they went on sale (expecting a late season race between the Cubs/Cards) it was not disclosed that these seats sucked. If I bought a car that didn't drive I would expect my money back. If I buy a ticket to see a baseball game and the game can't be seen, should I get my money back? I know that's not going to happen, but seriously.</p>
<p>Add to that the junk, including a discarded Toyota sign, that just sits around the place and you've got a sub-standard experience for the <a title="Ticket prices" href="http://www.chicagobreakingsports.com/2010/04/cubs-have-highest-average-ticket-price-in-baseball-in-2010.html" target="_blank">highest average ticket</a> price baseball. The Cubs organization has a history of making decisions based purely on how it affects revenue. My hope is that Tom Ricketts will change the ways of the past and start to make decisions on what is best for the fans.</p>
<p>We Cubs fans are loyal. If you change Wrigley it will piss off a lot of people. I think a fan base that can tolerate this much losing can tolerate a little bit of change. Keep what works and get rid of what doesn't.</p>
