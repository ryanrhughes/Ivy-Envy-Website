  content: "It's worth mentioning that the big 3 bad deals that Hendry gave out; Soriano,
    Zambrano &amp; Ramirez were all inked when Tribune Co. still owned the team, before
    T Co. was sold to Zell.  Opening day payroll has been between 100 &amp; 145 million
    since 07'.  The purse was never 'opened' so to speak, payroll rose after the team's
    sale because Hendry backloaded all the contracts that he inked before it.  He's
    had a top 8 payroll his entire tenure- under T Co, Zell, &amp; now the Ricketts.\r\n\r\nThe
    writing was on the wall after the sweep in '07, when it was clear that a) this
    core wasn't going to win a title as constructed &amp; b) the money wasn't going
    to be there to improve the team on the fly because Hendry had already spent it,
    mortgaging the team's next few years to make the run in 07/08.  Sure enough,
    in '09, we had 100+ million commited to just 7 players, &amp; the wheels started
    to come off in earnest.  \r\n\r\nI'm not saying he shouldn't have made those gambles,
    regardless of whether or not he overpaid guys who didn't deserve it.  But his
    big play didn't work out, and that was fully clear 2 years ago now.  As the architect
    of a failed blueprint, he deserved the blame.  Credit him for having the balls
    to make big moves, but more so, blame him for making moves that, even at the time
    he made them were questionable &amp; since have turned into spectacular failures."

  content: I read somewhere that before Bush was assistant general manager he was
    the assistant to the general manager.  Maybe Dwight Schrute can try to emulate
    him.

Hendry is out, Randy Bush is the interim and the private search begins for a permanent replacement. Thanks to the Cubs' recent hot streak (11-5 in August), Hendry leaves the Cubs with a barely winning record of 749-748. I haven't done the research, but I wonder if he'll be credited with those wins since he was actually fired, I mean, notified of the intended change on July 22. I'll let smarter people sort that out.</p>
<p>We've all been clamoring for this for some time. The comment section of every Cubs article written in the past two years has had more than a few "fire Hendry" comments. We've discussed it countless times on the podcast. It was definitely time to part ways. According to chairman Tom Ricketts and Hendry himself, the Cubs have not won enough games. Ricketts attempted to sum up Hendry's service with, "Three division titles during his tenure, a winning record from what I see on the press release..." I'm sure that made Jim feel nice. "...from what I see on the press release", really, Tom? Next time read the press release, but please don't refer to it by name. Just a suggestion.</p>
<p>How will we remember Hendry? Should he be judged on just the past two seasons? If we can posthumously revere every celebrity, regardless of merit, I'd like to offer a little post Cub review of Jim Hendry. At least one paragraph to recognize and credit him for some of the good things he did.</p>
<p>For any Cubs fan born after 1945, the Cubs have made the playoffs only six times in your lifetime. Three were with Hendry as GM. The 2007&ndash;08 seasons were the first back to back playoff appearances by the Cubs since 1907&ndash;08. Baseball GMs have a tough job. They're expected to predict the future based on past performance and then figure out how much to pay for it based on market trends. Predictions are nearly impossible and market trends only last until the next record contract. In this era all the top free agents go to the AL East and the rest of them want AL East money to play in the NL Central. Also, let's not forget that for the majority of his time with the Cubs Hendry had the misfortune of working for the Tribune Company, whose main focus was revenue, not winning. When Sam Zell finally gave him the green light to spend some money the goal was to boost the value of the organization, not long term success. Hendry made his run and put all his chips on the table. It was expensive, but he got the Cubs close&mdash;closer than they've been in 100 years. Remember that movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120148/">Sliding Doors</a>? Probably not, hence the link. One little change like missing a train changes your life. The pain of 2003 makes it easy to forget how close they were. One little change, and Jim Hendry is a Cub legend.</p>
<p>When I first starting writing I thought I would run down the list of good deals and bad deals, but you already know what they are. I'm not a Hendry apologist, I just want to give him his due. I'm happy Tom Ricketts made the right call and decided to move on, but we should recognize that Hendry gave us several years of really good Cubs baseball.</p>
