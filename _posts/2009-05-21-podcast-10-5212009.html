<p>This one is a few days early and a little shorter.</p>
<p>We discuss the recent woes and the series the Cubs just handed to the Cardinals.&nbsp; We cover it all and touch on the Jake Peavy/White Sox topic.&nbsp; We also play a clip from episode #9 where Paul predicts that Peavy will be dealt to the White Sox.</p>
<p>Tonight's episode includes Andy, Corey and our regular guest, Matt Veto.</p>
