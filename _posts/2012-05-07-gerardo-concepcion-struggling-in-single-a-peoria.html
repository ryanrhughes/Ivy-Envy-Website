    Conception will make six million over the next five years in the Cubs organization.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    When we went to the Bandits game against the Chiefs in 2010, I was a bit surprsied that with so much pressure to move forward in a particular organization that there were so many errors.&nbsp; Hopefully for us, the errors in this game won't do a number on Concepion's confidence as a pessimist might fear.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    Brian Bedo from miCubs did an interesting article this week about the Pacific Coast League and the relievers that we might be seeing in the near future.&nbsp; At the rate Concepion's going it looks like we're going to see the likes of De La Cruz, Beliveau, Rusin, and Maine long before Concepion, don't you think?

<p>Cuban defector Gerardo Concepcion was brought up to Peoria a few weeks ago to begin his voyage through the Cubs minor league system.  To say that Concepcion is having difficulties adjusting would be an under-statement.  </p>
<p>Concepcion has started 3 games for the Peoria Chiefs and has an 0-3 record.  It can't be that bad, right?  I mean, look at Ryan Dempster this season.  Concepcion is probably just not getting the offensive support, you say?  Well, it would take a lot of offensive support to help Concepcion out.</p>
<p>In his 3 games, Concepcion has tossed a grand total of 6 2/3 innings.  Five of those came in his first start.  Concepcion's latest outing was this past Saturday, against our hometown Quad Cities River Bandits (Cardinals affiliate).  Prior to the game, I was less than 10 feet from him as he was warming up.  </p>
<p>I thought that his "stuff" looked pretty good, but I definitely have an un-trained eye.  Chiefs staff were watching his warm-up closely and a few times coached him on his arm angle.  He was having difficulty locating pitches, but after making these adjustments, his accuracy improved drastically. </p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Concepcion2.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Concepcion2-300x224.jpg" alt="" title="Concepcion2" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7237" /></a></center></p>
<p>I was eager to see Concepcion take the mound in the bottom of the 1st, but that excitement quickly disappeared.  The QC River Bandits knocked the ball around the ballpark and the Chiefs' poor defense led to 7 runs in the 1st inning.  Concepcion did not return for the 2nd inning.  Concepcion was only charged with 2 earned runs in the outing, but his pitches did not fool the Bandits' batters one bit as he gave up 6 hits and a walk in the inning.</p>
<p>In his 3 starts and 6 2/3 innings of work, Concepcion has given up 19 runs (14 earned) on 19 hits.  Opponents are batting an incredible .514 against him.  </p>
<p>I assumed Concepcion's time with Peoria could be short.  He was probably the biggest off-season signing by Jed Hoyer and Theo Epstein and I think the expectations were that he would elevate through the system at a fast pace.  However, at this rate, Concepcion probably won't be going anywhere but down for the time being.  This is no doubt a tough change for him and hopefully he will receive the coaching that he needs to develop into the pitcher the Cubs think he can become.  </p>
