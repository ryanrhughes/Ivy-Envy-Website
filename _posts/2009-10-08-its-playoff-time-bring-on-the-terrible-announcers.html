  content: It appears we've fallen into another dimension or a bizarro world in which
    DeRosa plays for the Cardinals, Tim is a Yankees fan, Jimmy is a Dodgers fan and
    Dick Stockton calls games with Bob Brenly.  Is the good universe still out there?  There
    has to be an alternate universe where the Cubs are on their way to their first
    World Series title and the Cardinals are cellar dwellers, roster replete with
    Aaron Miles.  I feel like if I turn around right now, Spock will be standing there.  And
    he'll have a beard.

<p>It looks like Cardinals fans are cursed with Dick Stockton this year.&nbsp; I listened to last night's game on the radio, so I didn't have to suffer through old Dick.&nbsp; It boggles my mind that TBS brings that guy back every year.&nbsp; I don't think that calling a game is a simple task, but there are surely folks out there that can, at least, remember players names.</p>
<p>Bob Brenly is stuck in the booth with Stockton, this year.&nbsp; I have heard a lot of Cubs fans argue that Brenly is terrible, but I've listened to a lot of different broadcasts and I think Brenly is a pretty good color guy.&nbsp; But that discussion is for another day.</p>
<p>Stockton is awful and I'd rather have this guy in the booth:</p>
