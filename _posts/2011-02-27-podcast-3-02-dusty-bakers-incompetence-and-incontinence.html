<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the news from the Cubs Spring Training in Mesa.&nbsp; The overall attitude seems to be different this year.&nbsp; Carlos Pena is teaching Tyler Colvin the ropes at 1st base,&nbsp; Alfonso Soriano is asking for help with his swing and Carlos Zambrano's Opening Day streak is over.</p>
<p>We also talk about Dusty Baker and his asshats in Cincinnati.&nbsp; Lastly, we crown a winner for the contest on our Facebook page.&nbsp; The person with the best one-liner to the Dusty "crap" story won 2 box seats to a Peoria Chiefs vs. QC River Bandits game at Modern Woodmen Park.</p>
