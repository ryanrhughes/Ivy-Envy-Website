<p>I don't doubt Lou that much, but last night's 9th inning seemed like it could have played out a little different.&nbsp; Some of the pinch-hitting&nbsp;decisions <a id="more"></a><a id="more-105"></a>seemed a little odd to me.&nbsp; Henry Blanco with 2 outs in the 9th with the bases loaded?&nbsp; I would send up Jason Marquis before Blanco.&nbsp; And you know I love Matt Murton, but I'm not sure he's the man you count on for a double.&nbsp; Extra Base hits aren't really this thing this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest bone-head, Eric Patterson with Ronny Cedeno in a close second.</p>
