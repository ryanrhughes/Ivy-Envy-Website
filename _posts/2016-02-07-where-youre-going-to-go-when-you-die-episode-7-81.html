<p><img data-id="11626"  src="/uploads/2016/01/MillerPark_Tailgate_600x600-300x300.png" alt="MillerPark_Tailgate_600x600" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11626" />Welcome to the 377<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  We've got a shorter episode for you this week.  The big news of the week in Cubs-land was that the Cubs and Jake Arrieta avoided an arbitration hearing by agreeing on a contract for 2016. Many Cubs fans wondered why the organization didn't try to lock up Arrieta with a longer contract.  We talk about the number that was settled on and some possible reasons a contract extension isn't happening right now.</p>
<p>The Cubs brought back a familiar face in Matt Murton this week.  Murton has been playing ball in Japan and returns on a minor league deal.  We talk about his years with the Cubs, what he has accomplished in Japan and how the Cubs might plan to use him in 2016.  </p>
<p>You have just a few more days to purchase your tickets to our Cubs/Brewers meet-up and tailgate in Milwaukee.  Justin Jabs makes an appearance on the podcast to share why you should attend this event.  You can purchase your tickets at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/tailgate">http://ivyenvy.com/tailgate</a>.</p>
<p>At the end of the show, we play some voicemail on your favorite Cubs memories from the 1980s.  </p>
