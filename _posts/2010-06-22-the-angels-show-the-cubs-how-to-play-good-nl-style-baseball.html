<p>Before Friday's game, I really felt that if the Cubs could put together a solid series, they could <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">work their way into the NL Central race</span> make me feel better about this team.&nbsp; I've mentioned this many times, but the Angels are my 2nd favorite team.&nbsp; I've been looking forward to this series all season.&nbsp; But man, the Cubs are really doing everything they can to push me away.</p>
<p>Friday's game was just painful to watch.&nbsp; Watching the Cubs commit errors and mental mistakes is hard enough, but when they do it against one of the best fundamental teams in baseball, it really stands out.&nbsp; I believe Pat Hughes said that the Angels are #1 in the majors at going 1st to 3rd on a base-hit.&nbsp; This is what I want the Cubs to be.&nbsp; I think I can handle the Cubs losing if they played good and fundamental baseball.&nbsp; Of course, good fundamental baseball leads to winning...so yeah.</p>
<p>The Cubs put together a rally in the 9th with homeruns by Colvin and Lee.&nbsp; For some reason, this only pissed me off more.&nbsp; I knew they'd come up short.&nbsp; Situations like that aren't a rush for me this year.&nbsp; I know they won't end well.&nbsp; Don't try to get my hopes up.&nbsp; Interestingly, J from <a href="http://www.gardenofhalos.com" target="_blank">Garden of Halos</a> told us on the last podcast that the Angels bullpen is awful and if the Cubs could get into the Angels bullpen, they would have a chance, regardless of the score.</p>
<p>You might think that Sunday's slaughter of the Angels would draw me back in.&nbsp; It doesn't - it makes me hate them more.&nbsp; How dare they put up a 12-spot in the 3rd game of an awful series?&nbsp; I am so tired of seeing L-L-W in a series, then they don't carry anything over to the next series.</p>
<p>So I feel I have three options with the Cubs at this point in the season, and in my life.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Option #1: </strong>Continue rooting on the boys in blue every day - living and dying (mostly dying) with every pitch, batter, inning and game.</p>
<p><strong>Emotions from taking this approach:</strong> Frustration, Anger, Depression</p>
<p><strong>Option #2: </strong>Give the Cubs the old "it's not you, it's me" talk.&nbsp; Thank them for their 25 years and be on my way.&nbsp; I can give a laundry list of reasons and the list ends with the fact they play Zombie Nation at Wrigley Field now.&nbsp; The idea of leaving the Cubs sounds ridiculous and I've dismissed it anytime I've heard a friend consider it.&nbsp; However, it's beginning to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>Emotions from taking this approach: </strong>Relief, initial 20 lb post-break-up weight gain, then a 30 lb weight loss to appeal to a new team, pleasure from finding a younger and hotter team, years of the ability to look back on a wasted 25 years and see how much better off I am since I broke it off.&nbsp; And I'll make big money by selling this website.</p>
<p><strong>Option #3: </strong>Put 2010 behind me.&nbsp; Call it a season, enjoy the summer and if I don't happen to have anything to do, maybe I'll turn a Cubs game on.&nbsp; I'll wait and see what they do to build a winning team and get my hopes up, if their moves warrant that.</p>
<p><strong>Emotions from taking this approach: </strong>A care-free spirit this summer, indifference when they get swept by the Pirates.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is this:&nbsp; What fun is it to be a fan of a team that you don't like?&nbsp; I think I know what will cure all of this.&nbsp; In a few weeks, I will see the Cubs play twice in Phoenix and once in LA.&nbsp; Going to see the Cubs on the road should re-fuel me a little.&nbsp; For now, it will probably be Option #3, but Option #2 is closer than it's ever been before.</p>
