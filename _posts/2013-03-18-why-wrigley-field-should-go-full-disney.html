  content: Great post, Michael. I think this type of direction is exactly what the
    Cubs should be looking at. They've got a chance to lead here instead of following.

  content: "This is interesting. I really like the idea of throwback advertising.
    A lot. Someone should pitch that to the brass. It might be difficult to sell to
    advertisers who worked so hard on getting their new brands thrown together. But
    then again, they would stand out from all other ballparks broadcast each night.
    In fact, I'd bet people would actually spend time looking at and critiquing the
    advertising instead of trying to ignore it. \nThe only place I'd stop short on
    would be the character costumes. I do think the khaki-shorts-and-polo-shirt wearing
    young adults with secret-service earpieces are ridiculous and unfriendly looking.
    But I always feel bad and embarrassed for the people that have to dress in costume.
    Maybe something in between. \nSomebody call Ricketts. I'll bet Jeff can get his
    number from Papa Hendry."

<p>There are three things that make a franchise great: Great Teams, Great Fans, and a Great Ballpark. Unfortunately, the Cubs are only owners of two of those things and right now they are at odds with each other. Wrigley Field, at 99 years old, needs to be updated. I think everyone knows that. As the owners of this historical place, the Ricketts are trying to bring it into the 21st century so they can attract new fans and revenue. The die-hard fans are worried that bringing in these modern things to the ballpark will hurt the experience by negating the beauty of a hundred years worth of steel, brick, and ivy with giant LED screens, booming sub-woofers, and even goofy mascots. Seemingly, this puts the fans against the Ricketts. It doesn't need to be that way. I think the Cubs can bring in revenue while still letting the fans have the feel of going to the same ballpark their parents and grandparents enjoyed. </p>
<p>I think the Cubs need to go full Disney at Wrigley Field. I know many of you just screamed at the computer, but let me make my argument for why I think this could satisfy the Ricketts and the fans so that everyone is happy with Wrigley Field. </p>
<p>1) Disney-fication: Nobody goes to Disney World because they have the best rides or the shortest lines. In fact, based on these two things, it could be considered the worst amusement park ever. But it isn't. People go to Disney World because of the atmosphere. They know when they get there that they will be immersed in Main Street U.S.A. or Frontierland. Everything from the janitors to the scenery while you are waiting in line is meant to make you feel as if you have stepped into that world. This should be the same at Wrigley Field. When we go there, we should feel as if we have stepped back in time to that mythical golden era of baseball. It should be a complete nostalgia fest. Fans love the feel of the park, families love the entertainment, and tickets sell for the experience, so the Ricketts like it too. </p>
<p>2) Appropriate Advertising: One of the big sticking points with many Cubs fans is that we don't want garish neon red Toyota signs sticking out like a sore thumb on a beautiful hundred year old ballpark. That doesn't mean we can't have advertising. The Cubs marketing team needs to sell advertising everywhere, but mandate that it looks like old Coca-Cola/Norman Rockwell type advertising. They could put these up all over the concourses or on huge billboards behind the bleachers and it would actually reinforce the idea that fans are at an old time game because the ads would look old. </p>
<p>3) No Jumbotron: The big plus for a jumbotron is that the Cubs can sell advertising on it. I would hope with the added signage throughout the park, it would alleviate this issue. Everyone, and I mean everyone, loves the hand-operated scoreboard. Adding a jumbotron would take away from that, thus taking away from the experience of the game. I would even get rid of the digital signs throughout the park because they don't fit the theme of the golden age of baseball. At Wrigley, they can sell analog.</p>
<p>4)Music instead of Mascots: The idea of mascots has been thrown around for the kiddos to be entertained. This is not a good idea. Mascots are only entertaining for kids for about 3 minutes while they say hello and get a picture. Then it's gone. Do the kids remember mascots afterward? No. It's wasted time, money, and parental frustration trying to track these guys down for a picture. Instead, Wrigley Field can play up different musical interactions that fit better into the overall atmosphere. A brass band can play jazz on the concourse. A blues guitarist can entertain on the outdoor patio bar providing entertainment on the patio and for people standing out front of Wrigley Field waiting to get in. Behind the scoreboard in the bleachers, the young men who drum on buckets can perform. The organ needs to be brought down from the broadcast area and put somewhere that people can watch the organist play the soundtrack to the game happening on the field with a large beautiful organ. The organ music should be the only music pumped out to the stands during the game. This makes four different places you can take your kids to experience four types of music, all of which are organic to Chicago and the Wrigley Field experience. These different experiences would actually entertain kids longer than a mascot and give parents something interesting to see as well. It will help make Wrigley Field more family friendly without costing families an extra $50 bucks to watch their kids throw a ball or swing a bat in an arcade. </p>
<p>5) Castmembers: I think there are plenty of people in Chicago who would be happy to go to Wrigley Field and play make believe all day. The ticket takers, ushers, and food/beverage service people could all wear period type costumes to help complete the theme. Programs would look like newspapers on the outside and there could be NEWSTANDS selling souvenirs. No more people in polos and hats anymore looking like security types or people you don't actually want touching your food. Like a job as a Disney castmember, Wrigley character jobs would become a draw for all types of Chicago actors and improv groups, which have a long history in the city. </p>
<p>In this age of new ballparks trying to overwhelm the fan with every gadget imaginable, Wrigley Field can market themselves as exactly the opposite of that. Creating a Disney-esque theme park feel could actually enhance the feel of Wrigley by creating a golden age of baseball that would only exist on the North Side of Chicago. I think even more people would come just to have that feeling again of when they were kids and it was about the game and not the video scoreboards or the kiddie arcades. The extra musical element and the castmembers would just enhance this experience. Fans want nostalgia, and the Ricketts could give it to them. It would be a complete nostalgia-fest every game. </p>
<p>This may not be the perfect solution, but it seems to me it would be a step towards satisfying both parties. Added marketing revenue plus added fan experience seems like a win/win. Plus, Wrigley Field will be the only place doing this. The Ricketts could try to wedge in a scoreboard here or a mascot there, but it would seem like a cheap knock-off of the other fields. It would be an old guy wearing skinny jeans and fiftynine fifty hat. Everyone would know it is wrong. Instead, they could go their own way and create a fan experience from the past that no other ballpark can match.  </p>
