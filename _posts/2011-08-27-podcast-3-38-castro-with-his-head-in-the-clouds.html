  content: "A couple things here:  \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost you always want to have
    your head in the game but at this point we're so far behind in the standings I
    can understand why he may have been daydreaming a bit.  This is another glaring
    example of why the schedule needs to be shortened to 140 again, the overall quality
    is becoming too thinned out as teams are mathematically eliminated.  (I do understand
    that with a longer schedule, teams are mathematically eliminated later these days
    but you can't disagree that the level of play is watered down in the 162 game
    season.)  I'm sure a lot of players are guilty of this and he's a young guy so
    I'm not very concerned about it just yet.  \r\n\r\nNow, in regards to Mr. Valentine's
    comments.  I thought at the beginning Bobby Valentine was alright.  I thought
    he provided genuine insight.  But nowadays, he talks about EVERYTHING.  He's got
    an opinion on almost anything in the world, and to make matters worse, he's super
    biased for everyone who he's ever worked for or worked with, which is everybody
    in MLB.  He may have been right about Castro but it's pretty trivial when you
    consider some of the other major shit he glosses over on an almost nightly basis.

<p>Andy and Corey welcome returning guest, Brian on this week's episode.  They talk about Castro being called on out a national ESPN broadcast by Bobby Valentine for not paying attention while in the field.  </p>
<p>We go through a bunch of listener-suggested topics and talk about what we have been using to distract ourselves from a miserable Cubs season. </p>
