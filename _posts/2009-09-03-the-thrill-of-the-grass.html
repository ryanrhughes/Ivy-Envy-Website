  content: "I have to admit I'm finding it difficult to just enjoy the games when
    they are generally playing poorly. My game watching time has to be half what it
    was at the beginning of the season. As baseball becomes more of a business and
    less of a game we become more consumers than fans. Americans, as consumers, are
    notorious for their extreme product demands and I think that's translating to
    baseball (and other sports).\r\n\r\nI like to think that I'm one of the old school
    fans, watching because I love the game, but I have a hard time letting go of the
    fact that a guy making $17 million doesn't exert $17 million worth of effort (see
    Corey's new post). Free agency has forever changed \"the game\" and I'm not sure
    we can return to the days of old. For every great Fontenot play there seems to
    be ten Soriano mistakes."

  content: Yeah, I guess my post was a little idealistic, but I would make the argument
    that there is as much good as there is bad.  And I'll go ahead and say it--I kind
    of enjoy a good fielding gaffe sometimes.  Seeing a player mess up on a hard-to-handle
    ball helps us to be able to appreciate the times where they miraculously make
    the play that much more.

  content: The good news is...we'll make really good old guys. I already drive slow
    and I love to talk about "the way things were".

<p>In W.P. Kinsella's "The Thrill of the Grass," the narrator describes a fellow fan:</p>
<blockquote><p>He is a fan.&nbsp; Really a fan.&nbsp; When the weather is intemperate, or the game not close, the people around us disappear like flowers closing at sunset, but we are always there until the last pitch.&nbsp; I know he is a man who attends because of the beauty and mystery of the game, a man who can sit during the last of the ninth with the game decided innings ago, and draw joy from watching the first baseman adjust the angle of his glove as the pitcher goes into his windup.</blockquote><br />
In the past, Cubs fans in general have had a reputation as&nbsp; being these types of fans.&nbsp; Is that the case anymore?&nbsp; It feels like winning is becoming everything.&nbsp; Can we still just simply sit "with the game decided innings ago" and just enjoy the beauty of the game?&nbsp; With the Cubs needing a miracle to make it into the playoffs, just enjoying the game is pretty much the only option now.&nbsp; And that's why many have quit "wasting their time" on the Cubs, moving on to the Bears or college football or whatever.&nbsp; Yesterday, however, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090902&amp;content_id=6758096&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Mike Fontenot reminded us of the beauty of athletic excellence </a>with his sliding catch in foul territory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article uses this play as proof that the Cubs aren't giving up.&nbsp; I don't know how true that is, but it does prove that excellent plays can happen anytime.&nbsp; I hope to see plenty of them yet this fall, even with "the game decided innings ago."</p>
