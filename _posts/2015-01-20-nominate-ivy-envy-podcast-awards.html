<p>Last year, our podcast was a finalist in the Sports category of the 9<sup>th</sup> Annual Podcast Awards. It was incredible to represent our podcast and listeners at the Podcast Awards ceremony in Las Vegas last January. We lost to ESPN, but it was incredible to be listed next to the biggest names in sports broadcasting.</p>
<p>The nomination period is underway for the 10<sup>th</sup> Annual Podcast Awards. Nominating us is very easy and we'd really appreciate it if you took the 30 seconds to do it.</p>
<p>Simply go to <a href="http://podcastawards.com" target="_blank">http://podcastawards.com</a> and enter "Ivy Envy" in the show name at the show URL is http://ivyenvy.com.</p>
