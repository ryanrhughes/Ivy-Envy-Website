<p>On this lengthy episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast, Andy and Corey spend a significant amount of time talking about Junior Lake's call-up to the Chicago Cubs.  We talk about many of the aspects of this call up, from the timing of it all, to how the Cubs are using him defensively, to the strengths and weaknesses of Lake at the plate, to the inevitable comparison and potential position battle with Starlin Castro.  </p>
<p>We briefly mention the trade rumors...just to say that we aren't going to talk about them.  Wrigley renovations become a little more concrete.  Then, we answer some listener questions that include the Cubs showcasing Junior Lake to interested teams, a baseball park etiquette scenario, a Cubs player that will hit .300, Travis Wood's post All-Star game production and the lousy 6-21 record the Kane County Cougars have in the 2nd half of the Midwest League season.  </p>
<p>We have a few Internet Muscle Flexes for you and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
