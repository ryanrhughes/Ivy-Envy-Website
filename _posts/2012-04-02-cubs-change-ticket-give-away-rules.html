  content: Like I said in my response to that post, the Cubs are similar to the Dallas
    Cowboys - they have fans everywhere.&nbsp; To deny those people access to this
    contest was total bullshit.&nbsp; What amuses me is that nobody from the MLB office
    seems to catch that.&nbsp; And it's a pretty hard thing to miss.&nbsp;

<p>Last weekend, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6942" target="_blank">I wrote a post</a> about the distance rule for tickets given away by the Cubs.  According to the official rules (at the time), if you reside more than 100 miles from Wrigley Field, you are not eligible to win free tickets. </p>

<p>The Cubs have informed me that they&rsquo;ve changed this rule.  It was originally a rule that was handed down by Major League Baseball and the Cubs have received an exemption and the rule now reads:</p>

<p>This is a great move by the Cubs.  The number of Cubs fans outside of the 100 mile radius is enormous.  The Cubs have shown their loyalty those of us that live a distance away.  It would have been easy for the organization to hear these complaints and dismiss them.  However, they took the time to address the situation and make the change. </p>
<p>Follow the Cubs on Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/cubs" target="_blank">@Cubs</a> for news and potentially free tickets, regardless of your location. </p>
