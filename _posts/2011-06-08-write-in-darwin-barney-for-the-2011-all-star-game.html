  content: "If for no other reason, do it to cancel out some of the bullshit votes
    that some big city players have received undeservedly.\r\n\r\nThe list is a complete
    crock if you've seen who's leading.  It's further proof that usually you can't
    trust the fans to make a decision, and if you do that, you have to have some sort
    of a weigted system where the writers' votes count for 40% or more.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>On last weekend's podcast episode, Jason from Moline asked us about our choice for the Cubs representative(s) for the 2011 MLB All-Star Game.  Over the last few weeks, I've been advocating for Darwin Barney and it's time for the campaign to begin.  </p>
<p>I'm really not going to get into his accomplishments.  I'm going to simply sell him on you by saying this:  Which player on the Cubs roster this deserves an All-Star appearance more than Darwin Barney?  He entered Spring Training expected to start the season in the minor leagues.  He worked hard and earned a spot on the team.  Then his performance throughout Spring Training earned him the starting spot at 2nd base.  And now he's become, perhaps the most reliable batter on this team.  </p>
<p>I'm not a fan of fan voting for the All-Star Game, but I will be casting a ballot (or the 25 allowed by MLB) for Darwin Barney.  It takes a little more effort because you have to write him in, but Darwin deserves a few seconds of your time.  Do the right thing.  </p>
