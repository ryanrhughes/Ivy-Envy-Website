While we were excited about the Cubs in 2009, it's been a dry spell since and I think we're heading into the most interesting Cubs season since we started the podcast.</p>
<p>This is the 298<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast. We'll be recording #300 in two weeks when Andy and I are in Arizona for Spring Training. We'll be there March 14-20, with our official meet-up on Thursday the 19<sup>th</sup> for the Cubs @ Diamondbacks game. If you would like to attend the meet-up, email corey@ivyenvy.com for information. We suggest purchasing <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/19004D88759617A4?tfl=Arizona_Diamondbacks-Schedule-D~backs_Schedule-na-x0" target="_blank">the general admission lawn seats</a>.</p>
