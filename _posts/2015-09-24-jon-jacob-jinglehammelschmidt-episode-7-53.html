<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this, the 349<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we look back on the series that the Cubs just wrapped up with the Milwaukee Brewers.  The Cubs won the series 2-1 and Jake Arrieta earned his 20th win of the season.  </p>
<p>We continue to look towards the playoffs on this episode.  The topic of curses, goats, Bartman and Back to the Future II are inevitable, but they can still really annoy us.  We talk about the mental state of Cardinals fans, the Cubs performance this season against the 3 NL divisions, the Cubs&rsquo; future plans with Starlin Castro.  We also award an Asshat of the Week on this episode. </p>
