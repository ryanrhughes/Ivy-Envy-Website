    won't all be the next Ernie Banks, but I hope at least one or two of them will
    show enough promise to be Cubs of the future.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The off-season is officially over in Major League Baseball.  Pitchers and Catchers for the Chicago Cubs are due in Mesa today, although many players have been arriving over the last week.  Position players are due to report to Spring Training on Friday.</p>
<p>The 2010 season was miserable for us Cubs fans and the off-season was a welcome break...a break that probably started in August for a lot of us.  But with a new season comes a clean slate.  Expectations aren't sky-high for the boys in blue this year, and that means we, as fans, can find pleasure in any unexpected positives we experience in 2011.</p>
<p>While there aren't many position battles outside of the pitching staff, there are a lot of new and young players to keep an eye on.  Spring Training is the perfect opportunity for young players to display their talent.  Tyler Colvin earned a spot on the 2010 roster with his performance in Spring Training last year.  Starlin Castro started in Single-A in 2009 and ended up playing most of the 2010 season with the Cubs after capturing everyone's attention in the 2009 Arizona Fall League and Spring Training of last year.</p>
<p>As the aging and large contracted players begin dropping off, we will continue to see these young players coming up from the farm system and Spring Training is the opportunity for players like Brett Jackson, Trey McNutt and Josh Vitters to make their names more familiar to the average fan.  Injuries and the roster expansion allowed quite a few pitching prospects to make their way to the big club in 2010 and it'll be interesting to see these players (Carpenter, Cashner, Coleman) use Spring Training to make their cases for roles on the 2011 pitching staff.</p>
<p>What you can also expect in Spring Training is older players that are signed to Minor League or non-roster contracts with Spring Training invitations trying to fight there way onto the roster.  These are usually players that are on the backside of their careers or trying to prove themselves after injuries.  Notable players that are in this position this year are:  Reed Johnson, Todd Wellemeyer, Augie Ojeda and Braden Looper.</p>
<p>It's been a long winter and unfortunately, baseball players getting Spring Training officially underway doesn't help warm temperatures or melt snow here in the Midwest.  It is, however, a big step closer to green grass, ivy on the brick wall and baseball games on the tv and radio.</p>
