  content: "I am excited that we locked up Marmol.\r\n\r\nAbout the pitching motion
    not being natural:  Anytime that you have a guy who plays a particular sport get
    an injury named after him, it's definitely an unusual situation.  (I'm referring
    to Tommy John surgery of course)\r\n\r\nWe acquired Kerry Wood to sell tickets
    and to be available for middle relief.  (You want to see him close?  At this point,
    I'd almost rather see Kevin Gregg close) \r\n\r\nI am veruy excited about Matt
    Garza and I am a future Garzamaniac.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Pitching staffs are easily plagued with injuries.  Pitching is an unnatural body motion and it doesn't take much for the torque and pressure to mess things up.  Cubs fans are familiar with the effects that injuries can have on pitching staffs.  Two words: Wood and Prior.  Let's first look at the starting pitching rotation, and then the bullpen.</p>
<p>The starting rotation stayed fairly healthy last year.  Ted Lilly missed the first three weeks of the season.  While he got through the 2010 season without (physical) injury, Carlos Zambrano did not really contribute to the rotation (due to demotion and suspension) until August.  Because of his injury history with the Mariners, Cubs fans didn't have much hope for Carlos Silva being healthy (or even an asset) to the rotation.  Silva missed a start here and there, but only had one trip to the 15-day DL.  He finished the season with 21 starts and managed to win 10 of those.</p>
<p>The newest addition to the Cubs rotation, Matt Garza, has been very healthy in his short career.  He has been to the disabled list just as many times as he's thrown a no-hitter.  That's not to say that he's invincible, but he has the reputation of being a gamer and probably playing through some minor injuries.</p>
<p>In 2011, I think the starting pitching could be the position that is least affected position on the team.  Injuries aren't a lethal blow if the club has worthy players to step up.  There are quite a few positions on the team that do not have worthy players on the bench, but pitching is not one of them.  The Cubs have a plethora of young pitchers that will be in the bullpen, but capable of stepping up and starting.  According to the Cubs, they have "more than 10 candidates" for the starting rotation.  There are some good candidates in that bunch.  The future of the Cubs pitching staff is in that bunch.  Some experience would probably serve these guys well.</p>
<p>When it comes to the bullpen, I don't really think about injuries outside of the closer.  Most years, I think bullpen pitchers are disposable and one isn't much better than the other.  I don't think you can blame the 2010 season on the loss of Angel Guzman.</p>
<p>Carlos Marmol is the best Cubs closer since Randy Myers and Rod Beck.  He's probably the most exciting closer I have watched.  If you watch the games on tv, you know how ridiculous his pitches are.  Last July, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3061" target="_blank">I had the opportunity to watch a Cubs game in Phoenix, </a> directly behind homeplate, 5 rows back. Watching Marmol pitch from this vantage point is (sadly) one of the highlights of my sports life.&nbsp; It was incredible to experience and even had the scouts around me laughing and shaking their heads.&nbsp; His slider moved in ways that seem to defy physics.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-261.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3088" title="California Trip 2010 261" src="/uploads/2010/07/California-Trip-2010-261-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="379" height="285" /></a></center></p>
<p>In 2011, the Cubs have brought back fan favorite Kerry Wood.  While I doubt it's even being considered for Wood close games, I'm guessing if management wants to play it that way, they can easily convince Marmol that Wood is breathing down his neck.  So, since this post is about injuries, if Marmol was to sustain and injury, the Cubs are in a better position to replace Marmol in 2011 than they were in 2010.  </p>
<p>Overall, I think this pitching staff will be fine in regards to injury.  I don't want to see any starters go down, but like I said, getting some experience for these young guys might be good for the Cubs in the long run.  </p>
