<p>We are having our monthly Cubs game-watch at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline.&nbsp; Twenty has been a great sponsor and eager to work with us.&nbsp; They have twenty beers on tap and a menu with great food.</p>
<p>The Cubs will play the Astros and the game starts at 7pm, so come on down.&nbsp; Twenty is located at 1405 5th Avenue in Moline.</p>
