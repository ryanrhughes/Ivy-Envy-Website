  content: "Question: What's worse, running down a ridiculous hill after cheese or
    being assigned to the team of uniform clad dudes that has to catch the idiots
    at the bottom?\r\n\r\nI saw a bit of E:60 (ESPN's attempt at Dateline NBC) today.
    Jeremy Schaap did a story on the cheese chasing. He even started the bit with
    a dramatic, \"It's a Spring day in Gloucestershire, England\"...Priceless.\r\n\r\nhttp://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=4361361&categoryid=3060647"

<p>After the way the Cubs played during the 1st half of the season, I thought I would have to give up baseball for the summer and switch to competitive cheese rolling.</p>

<p>But the Cubs have been on a tear since the break (9-2), and they are still in the hunt for the cheese.&nbsp; The guys who were dead weights for the 1st half have finally been contributing more consistently, and the offense as a whole has been better.</p>

<p>Monday:</p>
<p>The offense did struggle a little versus Magic Wandy, but the 1-1 tie set the stage for an exciting 9th, culminating in Font's failure to connect on the squeeze bunt as well as Soriano's winning grand slam in the 13th.&nbsp; Soriano was saved from his earlier embarrassment of not running to first after he assumed the umpire was going to call his grounder a foul.&nbsp; Replays showed fairly conclusively that the ball did not make contact with his foot, and Brenly admonished him for not trying to at least "sell it."&nbsp; He advised Soriano to "hop around a bit."&nbsp; Maybe he should turn to soccer for acting help.</p>

<p>The worst part about the botched squeeze play for me was the opportunity to hand that tool Valverde the loss.&nbsp; At one point during the inning, he spit his three-sticks-of-gum wad out onto our grass.&nbsp; How dare you!&nbsp; It was pretty awesome seeing Latroy get the boot for swearing at the ump.&nbsp; I didn't think the pitch in question was an obvious strike--it was borderline.&nbsp; The entertainment value of this game was high, and things like Hawkins getting thrown out for making a mountain out of a molehill only made it better.</p>
<p>Tuesday:</p>
<p>Yuck.&nbsp; The game was fun early on, but it quickly went down the crapper.&nbsp; The high point was Ramirez tying the game with a three-run homer, but everything went to hell for the Cubs after that.&nbsp; I want to like Heilman.&nbsp; I really do--especially since the guy's been a Cubs fan since he was a kid, but every time he gets inherited runners, they seem to always come around and score.&nbsp; I have a feeling that if they would have left Stevens in the game, he would've gotten out of it.&nbsp; Once again, our favorite <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=210" target="_blank">asshat</a> came into the game in the ninth, and once again he spit his prodigious wad of gum onto the field after walking Fukudome.&nbsp; Valverde better hope he never runs into the Menard's Ground Crew in a dark alley.</p>
<p>Oh and Fulchino of the Astros caught a grounder up the middle in his jersey, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
