<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt kick off the 2013 season, and the fifth season for our podcast with the annual Cubs season predictions episode.  All of the statistical categories we made predictions on were submitted by listeners. </p>
<p>Before we start with that, we comment on the injury Darwin Barney sustained during an exhibition game in Houston against the Astros.  Also, the Cubs cut loose Hayden Simpson, their first round pick (16th overall) in the 2010 draft.  </p>
<p>We'd like to hear your opinions on the season predictions.  We will be posting them throughout the day to our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.  </p>
