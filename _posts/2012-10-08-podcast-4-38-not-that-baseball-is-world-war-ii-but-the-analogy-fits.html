<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt usher in the off-season with this episode.  We comment on Infield-Fly-gate before we jump into Cubs talk.  The Cubs announce that Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters will start the 2013 season in Iowa.  We talk about how these two players did in 2012 and predict what will happen in 2013 with them.  </p>
<p>Many fans may think the Cubs front office is reaching for positives by saying the climate in the clubhouse was improved in 2012.  There may not be many positives, but this is one area that might actually be pretty important.  We talk about our take on how things have changed in the clubhouse.  </p>
<p>Before we get to the photo caption contest, Kurt puts his Scary Stat of the Week on hiatus and introduces a new off-season segment.  </p>
