<p>In case you missed <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5957" target="_blank">the news</a>, we will be recording the 100th episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast this Saturday evening.  We will celebrate the milestone by doing the show live and broadcasting both the audio and video to our website.  The live show will start at 7pm and all you need to do is click on the "Live Broadcast" button, and play either the UStream (video and audio) or Mixlr (just audio) feed.  We will be able to take your phone calls during the show and we'd love to hear from you and talk about the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We will have a few neat things to give away during the show.  We will announce those over the next few days.  Anyone that calls in to the live-show will be eligible to win those prizes.  </p>
<p>We do have one prize that we will take entries for ahead of time.<br />
Mark and Gracie's will be giving away a little girl's (up to 5T) Cubs dress and hair-bow.<br />
