With the MiLB regular season completed, we check in on the teams in the Cubs system, from Eugene up to Iowa.  We also go through the Baseball America Top 10 Prospect list from before the season started and look at how the prospects did, which are no longer in the Cubs organization, and which made an impact on the major league team this season.  </p>
