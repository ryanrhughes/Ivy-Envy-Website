<p><a href="/uploads/2013/01/Samardzija-Good.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2013/01/Samardzija-Good-252x300.jpg" alt="Samardzija Good" width="252" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-8114" /></a>A friend recently asked me the $60 million dollar question that has been floating around Cubs circles for what seems like forever now: Will the Cubs deal Jeff Samardzija? He followed it up with the $25 question: should I buy his jersey tee?</p>
<p>After a rumored offer this off-season from Cubs brass to extend the former Golden Domer at a five year, $55 million clip didn&rsquo;t get the job done, both sides had put contract talks on the back burner to focus on the 2014 season.</p>
<p>Now, half way through May, the Cubs are drifting ever further from relevance at 14-27 and the yearly, league-wide struggle to combat attrition of pitchers seems to be going worse than usual (we miss you already, Jose Fernandez). These two items in tandem have begat conversations about which playoff hopefuls will be suitors for The Shark as we approach the trade deadline.</p>
<p>Brett at Bleacher Nation estimates that, as it stands, <a href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/05/13/lukewarm-stove-considering-the-very-early-jeff-samardzija-trade-market/" target="_blank">1/3 of the teams</a> in the MLB would want and have the means (an upper-echelon pitching prospect, and more) to acquire the Cubs defacto ace. Given Samardizja&rsquo;s sustained success and over a season and a half left of team-friendly control on his contract, the haul from a deadline trade would be tantalizing.</p>
<p>That said, with impact prospects knocking on the door to the Bigs, the front office knows that they need to beef up their rotation if the plans to contend in 2015, 2016 and beyond are going to come to fruition. Samardzija would be a huge piece of the puzzle if they can keep him in Cubbie Blue.</p>
<p>While many would welcome keeping Jeff and his flowing locks around, it seems more likely to me that the substantial pitching market developing is going to lead to the righty moving to a new team before the end of July. Meanwhile, the Cubs will be welcoming an influx of another team&rsquo;s (I&rsquo;m looking at you, Blue Jays) young, cheap talent that aligns with the timeline of the rebuild.</p>
<p>Sarmardzija&rsquo;s fate is far from sealed, but with Chicago again taking on the role of sellers at the trade deadline, potential buyers of Cubs gear with his name on it best beware.</p>
