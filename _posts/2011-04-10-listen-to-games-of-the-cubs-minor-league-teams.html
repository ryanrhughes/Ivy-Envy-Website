<p>We at Ivy Envy are becoming more and more interested in the Cubs Minor League System.  We were talking about it after the podcast recording on Saturday.  This interest could be from the larger number of players coming up through the system to the big league club.  It could also be from watching and talking with these guys while Kurt and I were at Spring Training.  For whatever the reason, we are paying more attention to these teams this year and we are going to try to keep you more up-to-date with the teams.</p>
<p>Jeremy and I will be splitting duties, covering the Peoria Chiefs.  I went down to Peoria for <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4784" target="_blank">Hayden Simpsons's professional debut</a>.  Because of location, the Chiefs will be the team whose games we will be able to attend most frequently.  Paul will be covering the high-A Daytona Cubs, Andy will be tracking the Double-A Tennessee Smokies and Kurt will be keeping an eye on the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.  We won't be doing daily updates or anything like that.  If something happens that is interesting or if a particular player is doing well or poorly, we'll clue you in.</p>
<p>If you have found your interest in the farm system increasing, you can follow these teams and listen to the broadcasts of their games pretty easily.</p>
<ul>
<ul> <strong>Peoria Chiefs - Class A (Low) - Midwest League</strong></ul><br />
The Chiefs have really embraced newer technology.  If you have an Android/Blackberry OS6/Dell Mobile/iPhone/iPad/Palm device, you can order food/beverages from the concession stands.  You will then receive a notification when your order is ready and you can go pick it up.  I played around with the app when I was in Peoria.  I didn't order anything, but it looked like it runs real smoothly.  The app is called "Bypass" and can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.bypasslane.com" target="_blank">www.bypasslane.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to listen to the broadcasts of the Chiefs' games, The Chiefs also have a free iPhone/iPad/iPod app that is available in iTunes.  Download the app, click on play and you'll hear Nathan Baliva doing play-by-play.  When there is not a game being broadcast, you will hear interviews, highlights and past games.  According to the Chiefs, this app will be coming to other devices.  This same programming is available on the Chiefs website at <a href="http://www.peoriachiefs.com/listenlive" target="_blank">www.peoriachiefs.com/listenlive</a>.<br />

<ul><strong> Daytona Cubs - Class A (High) - Florida State League</strong></ul><br />
The Daytona Cubs games are broadcast by WSBB 1230am - "The Great Voice of&nbsp;Volusia County" out of New Smyrna Beach, Florida.  But you don't need to be sweating down in Florida to listen to Michael Brenly at the plate or Nick Struck on the mound. &nbsp;You can listen to the Daytona games online <a href="http://radio.securenetsystems.net/radio_player_large.cfm?stationCallSign=WSBB" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<br><br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<ul><strong> Tennessee Smokies - Double A - Southern League</strong></ul><br />
The Smokies have some names that are sure to interest Cubs fans.  Three of the Smokies are in Baseball America's Top 10 Cubs Prospects list: Brett Jackson (#2), Josh Vitters (#5) and Rafael Dolis (#9).  If you'd like to track these guys, as well as the rest of the Smokies, you can listen live at <a href="http://www.smokiesonradio.com" target="_blank">www.smokiesonradio.com</a>.</p>
<p>The Smokies also have a free iPhone/iPod/Android app.  According to the Smokies website, the iPhone/Android app will allow fans to view the Smokies full schedule (including events), save game times and details to your personal calendar, buy tickets and merchandise, get up-to-date news, social media feeds, listen to every Smokies game live directly from your phone and much more.<br />
<strong> </strong><br />
<br><br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<ul><strong> Iowa Cubs - Triple A - Pacific Coast League </strong></ul><br />
Many of the players with the Iowa Cubs are on the Cubs' 40-man roster and just a phone call away from playing at Wrigley Field.  If you'd like to get more familiar with them before they get to the Majors, you can listen to them live <a href="http://66.208.178.20:8080/MiLB/GameAudio/LiveStreamFlash/pcl_iowa_cubs" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
</ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
There are even some television broadcasts of the minor leagues available, if you want to throw down $30/year or $7/month. &nbsp;<a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/multimedia/milbtv.jsp" target="_blank">MiLB.tv</a> streams and archives about 10-15 games Minor League games each day. &nbsp;It looks like most of the games are Triple-A games. &nbsp;The Iowa Cubs have games on MiLB.tv and while we are not that far from Des Moines and MiLB.tv does have a blackout policy, it does not appear that the Quad Cities are within the blackout region. &nbsp;Also, if you subscribe to MLB.tv, you can get MiLB.tv for only $10 for the entire season.</p>
