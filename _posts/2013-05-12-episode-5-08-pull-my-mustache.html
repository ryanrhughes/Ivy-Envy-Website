<p>We are just 4 weeks from our 200th podcast episode.  We're throwing a big party and you're invited.  Go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/200" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/200</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/138393423005544/" target="_blank">our Facebook event</a> for more information.<br />

<p>In this episode, Corey talks about going to a Cardinals game and observing everything from a modern vs historic perspective, considering the Cubs will be going through either renovations or a new ballpark.  We also get a little sidetracked with his daughter's passionate hatred of the Cardinals.</p>
<p>Jeff Samardzija is 1-5 on the year and has pitched quite well.  Will he be able to hold things together if this continues?  Anthony Rizzo is heating up at the plate and while it's nice to see his batting average jump, it's difficult to look past the glaring weaknesses that are plaguing Rizzo and the rest of the team.  </p>
<p>Garza is two rehab starts away and the Cubs will be moving either Villanueva or Feldman to the bullpen.  We spend some time on the bullpen has Fujikawa has returned from the DL and Kevin Gregg is defying all logic and absolutely destroying the opponents.  </p>
<p>Attendance has been down this year and the Cubs are looking at their lowest attendance in a season since 1997.  There have been many other bad seasons in that stretch, what makes this year even worse?</p>
<p>We answer some listener submitted questions on Ian Stewart and Dave Sappelt.  Then Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  </p>
