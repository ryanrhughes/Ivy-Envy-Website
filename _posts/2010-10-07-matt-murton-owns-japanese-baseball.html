    he's sticking around for another season.  Hopefully he returns to MLB some day
    and has some success here.\r\n\r\nMakes me wanna go out and buy a Hanshin Murton
    jersey!"

    to remember it being like 60 or 70 bucks with shipping and everything.  \r\n\r\nGood
    to hear from you Jake.  I assume we'll see you at the WAIW pub crawl, if they're
    doing that again."

<p>If you've read the site for a length of time, you'll know that most guys on the Ivy Envy team are big Matt Murton fans.&nbsp; I feel it's my duty to support, and remind Cubs fans of the feats of success of my fellow pelo rojo.</p>
<p>If you had lost track of Murton, he went to play for the Hanshin Tigers after he was released by the Rockies last December.&nbsp; Murton has settled into Japanese Baseball real well...at least on the field.&nbsp; I can't speak to his inclusion into Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Matt made headlines this week by setting the Nippon Professional Baseball record for hits in a season.&nbsp; What makes this especially note-worthy is the player that he de-throned from this record - Ichiro Suzuki.&nbsp; Murton got his record-breaking 211th hit in the 2nd inning against the Yakult Swallows on Tuesday and ended the game with 213 hits.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the league's season is 14 games longer now than it was in 1994, when Suzuki set the record.&nbsp; But it's great to see Murton succeeding in baseball.&nbsp; He finished the season batting .351 with 17 homeruns and 91 RBI's.</p>
