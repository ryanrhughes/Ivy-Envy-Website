Kerry Wood is back!&nbsp; He returns to Chicago with a one-year, 1.5 million dollar contract.&nbsp; Maybe having Wood again will restore some virility to the Cubs' pitching staff.&nbsp; This is a great deal for Chicago.&nbsp; Apparently, he gave the Cubs quite a discount.&nbsp; It was reported that Wood <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/12/cubs-to-sign-kerry-wood.html" target="_blank">was offered a 3.5 mil contract from the White Sox</a> and <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2010/12/odds-ends-wood-.html" target="_blank">even more from the Yankees and Red Sox</a>.&nbsp; As if we needed more reasons to love this guy.&nbsp; We know how much he loves Chicago, the Cubs, and Cubs fans.&nbsp; When he became a free agent in 2008, he took out <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/68510/kwoodgoodbye.PDF" target="_blank">a full-page ad</a> thanking the organization and the fans.&nbsp; He has also provided some electrifying moments, the most memorable being his 20-K performance in 1998.</p>
<p>But this move isn't just good for nostalgia.&nbsp; As a member of the Yankees toward the tail-end of 2010, Wood posted a 0.69 ERA, only giving up two earned runs in twenty-six innings pitched.&nbsp; He is a pitcher who gets a lot of strikeouts, and he will be a great veteran presence in the bullpen.&nbsp; The only concern is that the Cubs now have two pitchers who tend to walk a lot of batters potentially pitching back-to-back; however, this tandem could secure a victory in a hurry as well.&nbsp; I'm a fan of this move.</p>
