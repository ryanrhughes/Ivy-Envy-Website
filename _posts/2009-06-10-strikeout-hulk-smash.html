<p>The Cubs defeated the Astros 7-1 last night behind the strong pitching of Ted Lilly and the resurgence of some dormant bats.&nbsp; Lilly picked up his 7th win, Mike Fontenot went 4-5, including a solo homerun, and Geovany Soto went 3-5.&nbsp; The only bat that remained MIA was Milton Bradley's.&nbsp; He went 0-6, and smashed his bat on the plate in frustration after one strikeout.&nbsp; After a subsequent strikeout, Bradley peacefully gave the ineffective bat to a fan.&nbsp; Bradley ended up leaving 10 men on base!&nbsp; He got a little redemption with a great diving catch in the ninth inning, but it was a rough game for him.&nbsp; I'm trying my hardest to like Bradley, but he's making it very difficult for me.&nbsp; Making big strikeout hulk scenes just gives fuel to the haters.&nbsp; Doesn't he realize that?&nbsp; He has to, so apparently he has no control over his emotions (I do realize how late I am on that revelation).</p>

<p>Well, as many have already said, last night's game was one of the most enjoyable games to watch so far this season.&nbsp; I think this week is going to continue to be a nice week to watch Cubs baseball, and then this weekend against the Twins, we have the potential to return to our previously scheduled exercises in futility.&nbsp; But I hope not.&nbsp; Harden will be back on Saturday, and on Sunday I will be in Chicago to watch my man Ted destroy.&nbsp; Hopefully all of those Cubs bats stay alive and thrive.</p>
<p>-Jake Fox was sent back to Iowa after the Cubs activated Aaron Miles.&nbsp; Wheee.&nbsp; Now who is it going to be when Harden gets activated?</p>
<p>-The Cubs selected CF Brett Jackson with the 31st pick of the draft yesterday.&nbsp; Bleed Cubbie Blue posted a <a href="http://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2009/6/9/904393/bleed-cubbie-blue-welcomes-the" target="_blank">highlight video of Jackson</a>.&nbsp; If you haven't yet checked out Bleed Cubbie Blue, it is a good site for Cubs information, especially if you are interested in the farm system.&nbsp; They provide regular updates of how the Cubs minor-league players are doing.</p>
