<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tanakaweb12s-1-web.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tanakaweb12s-1-web-300x199.jpg" alt="Masahiro Tanaka" width="300" height="199" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8699" /></a>The New York Yankees bested Theo Epstein again and they are taking home the off-season free agency belle of the ball.  Masahiro Tanaka has reportedly agreed to a 7 year, $155 million deal with the Yankees.  </p>
<p>Although the odds were against them, the Cubs went after Masahiro Tanaka and the reports were that they "would not be outbid".  Even if they were willing to go as high as the Yankees did, there is one thing the Yankees have that the Cubs do not.  The Yankees are likely to win enough games to get into the post-season.  </p>
<p>Given the amount of money that's being reported in this contract, I'm ok with the Cubs not luring in Tanaka.  Of course, it would have been great for the Cubs to bring in a top of the rotation pitcher, and I would have been thrilled if the Cubs did sign him.  But the largest take-away for Cubs fans is that the Cubs were willing to spend a huge amount of money on a player they identified as fitting in their time-frame.  </p>
<p>As Cubs fans, we are now snapped back to reality.  The Cubs will likely continue the off-season approach we have seen recently.  You can expect the Cubs to look at cheap players that they can flip at the deadline to continue to stock the minor league system.  Former Cub Paul Maholm is probably near the top of that list.  Maholm was signed prior to the 2012 season and traded to the Braves with Reed Johnson for Arodys Vizcaino and Jaye Chapman.  </p>
<p>Not being able to sign Masahiro Tanaka shouldn't surprise Cubs fans.  It's tough to compete for free agents with the Yankees.  I think the biggest take-away from this whole situation is that we can expect the Cubs to spend in the next few years.  That "time-frame" is only getting closer and more and more players will begin to fit in it.  </p>
