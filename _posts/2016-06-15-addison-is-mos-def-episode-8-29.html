While a series loss can be discouraging, we share why the loss doesn't concern us and could actually help the team in the post-season.  </p>
<p>We also look at Addison Russell's sophomore season.  While his overall (offensive and defensive) numbers have dropped a bit, there are some explanations and some are rather curious.  </p>
<p>We read a few listener comments, one of which gets us back on the topic of the Cubs radio broadcast.  </p>
