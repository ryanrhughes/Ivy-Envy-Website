<p>I was lucky enough to get tickets to Friday's game. As soon as they announced Javier Baez was getting called up, I immediately looked for tickets. I ended up settling for 500 level tickets. When I got to Wrigleyville, there was just a different vibe around the park, one I had not felt in sometime. I cashed in my 500 level tickets for some bleacher seats and got in as soon as batting practice started.</p>
<p>With my First Night Game Rick Sutcliffe bobble-head in hand, my buddy and I found our way out to the left field seats. As perfect as the timing was, Baez was taking batting practice. He, in a group with Arismendy Alcantara, Starlin Castro, and Luis Valbuena, was peppering the bleacher seats. One of his moon shots actually hit a light post that is over the bleachers, probably 10 feet over the top row. Everyone filed in to see the 21 year old hit balls on to Waveland.</p>
<p>Before the game started, the loudest ovation during the lineups was, you guessed it, Javier Baez, playing second and batting second. He got more applause than All Stars Anthony Rizzo and Castro behind him. As he stepped up to the plate in his first at bat, the crowd was electric. Here is a vine I took when he stepped up to the plate for his first Wrigley at bat. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Pretty crazy huh? The place went nuts. When Baez broke hit bat and deposited the ball into left field for a single, the crowd gave him a standing ovation.</p>
<p>Every time the second baseman came to the plate, he got a standing ovation. With every violent swing, the crowd gasps while waiting for him to make contact so they can see how far he can hit it. Unfortunately, after his first at bat, he went 0-4 with 4 strikeouts. Obviously, we all know strikeouts are part of Javy's game.</p>
<p>The thing I took away from this game was the excitement for the future. Scattered across Wrigley were Baez #9 shirt jersey and actual jerseys. I couldn't go into a store in or around the park without seeing a Baez jersey, front and center, ready to be sold. </p>
<p>Being active on Twitter, I knew the excitement around Javier Baez, but it was awesome to feel the vibe around the park yesterday. Everyone knows what is coming in the next few years, and this is just the start of something great.</p>
