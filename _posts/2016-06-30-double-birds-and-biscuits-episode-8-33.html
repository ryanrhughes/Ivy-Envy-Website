  content: 'I used to live in the Dayton/cincy area and miss that pizza and was
    craving it after seeing it was free. I enjoy that ballpark but haven''t been down
    there in a while. Actually was at the game Sosa hit #500 there.'

In this episode, we recap the Cubs sweep over the Reds in Cincinnati.  Corey was at the last two games of the series and talks about the games from an inside-the-park perspective.</p>
<p>This was quite an eventful series and it was something the Cubs and fans needed after going 1-6 in the previous week.  </p>
