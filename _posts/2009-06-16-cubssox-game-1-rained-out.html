<p>Well, now that I am done for work for 2 months, I hope to be able to see more games and follow the daily ups and downs more closely.&nbsp; At this point, there is no make-up date for game one of this series.&nbsp; Let's hope it's scheduled a little better than the Cubs one game (at night) stop in Atlanta on Monday before heading up to Detroit.&nbsp; That Chicago-Atlanta-Detroit trip is similar to about 90% of the airline routes out of Moline International Airport.&nbsp; Oh, you want to go from Moline to Cleveland?&nbsp; How about a layover in Memphis, TN?&nbsp; Care to fly from Moline to Atlanta?&nbsp; Sure, we'll route you through Minneapolis.&nbsp; I once flew from Moline to Los Angeles and had layovers in Chicago, Denver and Las Vegas...yeah, on one flight.</p>
<p>Anyway, the rainout today might be good for the boys in blue.&nbsp; I was pretty nervous about the Cubs sending Soriano and Bradley to a soggy outfield.&nbsp; The Cubs don't need anymore injuries.&nbsp; I'm just glad I didn't have tickets and made the trip up to Chicago, find parking and sit down only to have it announced just after gametime that the game would be postponed.&nbsp; All I did was drive a few blocks down to Twenty and have a beer.</p>
<p>By the way, if you missed last night's podcast, it's right under this post...listen to it.</p>
