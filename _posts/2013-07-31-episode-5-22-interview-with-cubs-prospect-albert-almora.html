<p>On this episode, you will hear an interview that I did with Albert Almora.  Almora was the Cubs first pick, and the sixth overall in the 2012 draft.   Almora is currently playing with the Cubs Single A Midwest League affiliate, the kane county cougars.  After starting this season on the disabled list, the 19-year old has lived up to his hype by playing excellent defense and at the time of this recording, in 57 games, he is batting .328 and he's struck out in just 12% of his at-bats.</p>
<p>Almora is currently ranked the #2 prospect in the entire Cubs minor league system.  In the most recent rankings, Baseball America has Almora listed as the 16th best prospect in all of baseball.  So here is my interview with Cubs prospect, Albert Almora.</p>
