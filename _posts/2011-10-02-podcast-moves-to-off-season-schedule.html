<p>With the conclusion of the 2011 Cubs' season, The Ivy Envy Podcast will move to it's off-season broadcast schedule.  The podcast will continue to be released weekly, but on Tuesday evenings rather than Saturday mornings. The off-season episodes tend to be closer to 30 minutes in length, rather than their typical hour-long episodes during the baseball season.</p>
<p>Unless there is major news in the meantime, the next episode will be released on October 11th.</p>
