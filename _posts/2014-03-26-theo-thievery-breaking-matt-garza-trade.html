<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Matt-Garza.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9294" alt="Matt Garza" src="/uploads/2014/03/Matt-Garza-300x228.jpg" width="300" height="228" /></a>Last July, the Cubs traded their Ace, Matt Garza, the hottest pitcher in baseball at the time (people forget he was 5-0 with a 1.24 ERA in his most recent six starts), for a package of four Texas Rangers prospects, all of whom boasted upside and myriad question marks to match. Seven months later, the upside has taken center stage and the deal is beginning to look like an enormous coup for the Cubs. Just ask Rangers GM, Jon Daniels.</p>
<p>Daniels, just 36, has two AL pennants and a Baseball America Executive of the Year award under his belt, but <a href="http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4909387/daniels-says-garza-trade-could-haunt-him" target="_blank">recently lamented</a>, &lsquo;I thought way too short-term with the Garza deal last year. That one&rsquo;s got a chance to haunt us and haunt me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at how we got here.</p>
<p><strong>Rangers Acquire:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MATT GARZA</span><br />
<b></b>Matt Garza was just okay for Texas down the stretch; he posted a 4.38 ERA in 13 starts for the seemingly playoff-bound Rangers but never regained the form he showed before departing the Windy City. The Rangers post-season ended quickly, as did Garza&rsquo;s tenure in Arlington. The Rays beat the Rangers in a one-game playoff to decide the AL Wild Card race and now, zero playoff innings and an off-season later, Garza is a Milwaukee Brewer.</p>
<p><strong>Cubs Acquire:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MIKE OLT</span><br />
Mike Olt was the biggest name of the four acquisitions for the Cubs and his peaks and valleys the last few seasons have been the most drastic. In 2011 Mike Olt was raking for the High-A Myrtle Beach Pelicans and a consensus Top 50 prospect in the game when a collision at home plate on a strange play cost him the rest of the season.*</p>
<p>Olt bounced back from his broken collarbone, leading the Arizona Fall League with 13 bombs before a dominant 2012 campaign in AA Frisco led to an August call-up to the Rangers.**</p>
<p>The right-handed slugger was a coveted piece in the Rangers system but even with Adrian Beltre blocking his path for the foreseeable future at 3B and a need for another quality pitcher, the Rangers refused to move Olt. Then, while playing in the Domincan Winter league, Olt was struck by a pitch in the head. The beaning led to severe vision issues for Olt who struggled in the first half of the 2013 campaign in Triple-A Round Rock to the extent that the once untouchable prospect was now part of a package being sent to Chicago in return for a three month rental of Matt Garza.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today and Mike Olt is back to his old ways, crushing five homers this spring for the Cubs and making a legitimate bid to be the Opening Day Third Baseman for Chicago.</p>
<p>Olt&rsquo;s journey has been a tumultuous one but he appears to have come full-circle after Theo and Co. wisely bought-low in order to get him to the Northside. While Olt won&rsquo;t likely ever be a high-average guy, his impact power, tremendous on-base skills and serviceable defense (whether at third base or a corner outfield spot) have Cubs fans thinking he will be a long-term piece for the future and may just accelerate the timeline to sustainable success.</p>
<p>*I was interning for the Pelicans at the time. Olt was sent home from 3rd on a shallow pop fly to right that was played by the second baseman and was dead to rights at the plate when he collided with the catcher in attempt to jar the ball free. I will never be paid to coach 3<sup>rd</sup> base but I&rsquo;d wager in similar situations, the runner would almost never be sent.</p>
<p>** I was working for a team in Olt&rsquo;s division in 2012 and Olt was 1A to Oscar Taveras&rsquo; 1 on my Texas League MVP ballot. Olt slashed .288/.398/.579 while crushing 28 home runs before his cup of coffee with the Rangers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CJ EDWARDS</span><br />
CJ Edwards, the String Bean Slinger, is 6&rsquo;2 and is listed at 160 pounds. He is also the reigning Minor League Pitcher of the Year and ranks 5<sup>th</sup> amongst prospects in the stacked Cubs farm system. The lean righty struck out 155 batters in just 116 innings while posting a 1.86 ERA and allowing just one homer across two organizations last year.</p>
<p>Edwards has an easy delivery and three potential above average offerings according to Baseball Prospectus, though scouts are divided on whether his future is in the bullpen or starting rotation due to durability concerns and his small frame. One way or another, the righty has an impact arsenal to go with major league makeup.</p>
<p>He will start 2014 in Double-A Tennessee&rsquo;s rotation and if things go according to plan, will be making his Wrigley debut in 2015.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">JUSTIN GRIMM</span><br />
Justin Grimm is the second of three right-handed hurlers picked up for Garza that we will talk about today. Grimm, a former 5<sup>th</sup> Round pick out of the University of Georgia has a solid four-pitch mix and has already tasted big league success. In fact, Grimm won AL Rookie of the Month honors while still with the Rangers early last season.</p>
<p>Grimm could very well see his time split between Iowa and Chicago this year, pitching both as a starter and bullpen piece, as the front office finds the best fit for him.&nbsp; Whether he sticks at the back-end of the rotation or is an impact reliever, Grimm figures to be a mainstay on the Cubs major league roster sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NEIL RAMIREZ</span><br />
The PTBNL (player to be named later) in the Garza deal is far from a throw-in. Neil Ramirez is a power arm who ranked 77<sup>th</sup> in Baseball Prospectus&rsquo; Top 101 for 2012 and who still has a major league future in spite of an injury riddled past.</p>
<p>Ramirez will likely start the year in Iowa&rsquo;s rotation, needing to improve his command and stay healthy in order to remain a threat to crack the Cubs rotation in the near future. If the command profile doesn&rsquo;t improve, Ramirez still has plenty of upside in his arm, pumping a high-90s fastball in short bursts that would play just fine out of the pen- another favorable out come for the righty.</p>
<p>Look for Ramirez to contribute at the major league level this year.</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><br />
While the full worth of the Cubs bounty from the Garza trade won&rsquo;t be known until more time passes, we can begin to appreciate the heist right now.</p>
<p>Theo, Jed, and the rest of the Cubs brass turned a short-term rental arm into four major leaguers. That&rsquo;s precisely the kind of theft that can push the needle from &lsquo;rebuild&rsquo; to &lsquo;contender&rsquo; and turn the tides of a championship-deprived organization.</p>
