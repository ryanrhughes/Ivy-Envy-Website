<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/BaezBomb.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/BaezBomb-300x300.jpg" alt="BaezBomb" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9182" /></a>Javier Baez was assigned to minor-league camp on Friday. &nbsp;His spring training performance had left some fans clamoring for the Cubs to keep him on the big league roster. &nbsp;In 42 at-bats, Baez hit .310 with three doubles, 5 home runs, and 5 RBI. &nbsp;However, there are several reasons why the Cubs will start Baez at Iowa and bring him up to the big league club mid-season: team control and continued development defensively and offensively.</p>
<p>One good reason for holding off on bringing Baez up is that it gives the Cubs another year of team control if they wait until after the Super Two cutoff. &nbsp;He is 21 now, and if the Cubs wait to bring him up, they will have team control through 2020, when Baez will turn 27. &nbsp;By waiting, the Cubs will have team control for more of the prime of his career before they even have to worry about free agency. &nbsp;It is just smart on the part of the Cubs to try to maintain the longest period of control possible over one of the most potentially gifted players to come through the system in a while. &nbsp;Also, the Cubs need more than just one impact bat to be a playoff contender this season, so although Baez tearing it up in April for the Cubs would be fun to watch, it wouldn't be worth much.</p>
<p>Another reason for a mid-season call-up is that Javier could use some more work defensively. &nbsp;He committed 44 errors in his time with Dayton and Tennessee last season. &nbsp;We all know that if he is the Cubs shortstop of the future, he wouldn't exactly be supplanting a gold-glove-caliber player, but still, it would be nice to have a little upgrade defensively. &nbsp;Being in Iowa for a while also gives the organization a little more freedom to move Baez around defensively if it looks like they are going to stay with Castro at short.</p>
<p>"But he's tearing it up at the plate in spring training!" &nbsp;Yes, there's no doubt the kid can wear out a fastball, but this spring, he was made to look more than a little unseasoned on more than one occasion when all he had was a spate of breaking balls to look at. &nbsp;Some people even felt that Javier looked a little too out of control at times. &nbsp;To address that point, Patrick Mooney had an interesting quotation from Jason McLeod in <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/cubs/what-cubs-want-see-calling-javier-baez" target="_blank">a recent article</a>: "When you have the bat speed that [Baez] has--especially if he swings and misses--it's going to look out of control." &nbsp;It's pretty obvious that Baez could stand to develop the ability to be a little more selective at the plate, but coaching a player like Baez to that end is a delicate proposition. &nbsp;Yes, he could be a little more selective, but they don't want to moderate the things that have the potential to make him great either. &nbsp;Some internet muscle flexers seem to think that over-coaching has already been detrimental to players like Castro and Rizzo. &nbsp;Whether or not there's any truth to those claims, the Cubs do need to smart in the way they coach Javier Baez when it comes to batting.</p>
