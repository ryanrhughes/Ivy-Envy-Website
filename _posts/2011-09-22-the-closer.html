  content: "Excellent post man...good research.  \r\n\r\nWhat's most amazing to me
    is that since he's a closer, Rivera can throw as long as he wants and the rest
    is gravy.  Everything from here just piles on his extensive resume that would
    make it hard to argue with him being quite possibly the greatest closer of all
    time.  \r\n\r\nI don't know if Andy has ever mentioned this, but Marmol enjoys
    ranching.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mariano-Rivera.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6228" title="Mariano Rivera" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Mariano-Rivera.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="135" /></a></p><br />
Mariano Rivera recently became the all-time saves leader in baseball, breaking Trevor Hoffman's old mark of 601 career saves. &nbsp;This feat is impressive, and Rivera is definitely a rare pitcher. &nbsp;He has had a long and relatively injury-free career, all with one team, and though many of us Cubs fans dislike the Yankees, we have to begrudgingly admit that what he's done is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Rivera's first save came in 1996, and they've been a regular occurrence ever since. &nbsp;Since the beginning of his career, he has had 674 save opportunities and has saved 602 of them. &nbsp;That comes out to an 89% success rate! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for comparison's sake, let's look at what the Cubs' closers have done since 1996. &nbsp;In that 16-season span, closers/relievers for the Cubs have had 934 save opportunities, and they have successfully saved 611 of them. &nbsp;Those numbers equal out to a 65% success rate. &nbsp;Now, while that does sound pretty abysmal, consider that in 2008, the Cubs only saved 65% percent of their saves and still made the playoffs. &nbsp;I had thought in my head that a number like that would be super devastating to a team, but it appears that even with a lower save percentage, a team can still be successful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At any rate, here is the list of closers the Cubs have had in that 16-season span: Wendell, Rojas, Beck, Adams, Aguilera, Gordon, Alfonseca, Borowski, Hawkins, Dempster, Wood, Gregg, Marmol, and what the hell, let's throw Howry in there too, even though he was never official. &nbsp;So the Cubs have had 14 different closers in the span of time that the Yankees have had one. &nbsp;<br />
Who can forget the wonderful Alfonseca era? &nbsp;The team had a 48% save percentage that year! &nbsp;How about Dempster's 33 saves in 35 opportunities in 2005? &nbsp;The Cubs have had their closer highs and lows (mostly lows), and now we have Carlos Marmol.</p>

Earlier this season, I wouldn't have minded too much if we had seen him traded at the deadline, but now I'm not so sure. &nbsp;He has had a tough season--9 blown saves. &nbsp;There have been numerous painful outings. &nbsp;I used to think he would develop more control, but it is evident to me that what we see now is what we get. &nbsp;It is ironic that Marmol's wildness makes him so effective yet gets him in so much trouble. &nbsp;The thing is, that Marmol has a career 82% save percentage, and this year has still saved 79%. &nbsp;I think he will still have a season like 2010 again. &nbsp;His contract is through 2013, and I think that could be a good thing. &nbsp;And he's a goddamn rancher.</p>
