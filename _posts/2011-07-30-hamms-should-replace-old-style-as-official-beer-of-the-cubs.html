  content: This kind of summarizes whats wrong with the cubs, worrying too much about
    the past. 90% of cubs fans are actually Wrigley fans. If The rickett's wanted
    to get some extra income by getting a corporate sponsor of Wrigley it would cause
    riots even though it was one of the first sports venues to get corporate naming
    rights.

  content: "1.  If you are implying the writers of this blog are \"Wrigley Field Cubs
    fans\", we all live 3 hours from Wrigley, get there twice a year on a good year.
    \ When I think of the Cubs, I think of my Grandpa sitting in a lawn chair in his
    garage listening to the Cubs.\r\n\r\n2.  Yes, fans like tradition.  That is not
    a bad thing.  The love of the Cubs is generational and younger generations wanting
    to hold onto what ties us to our parents and grandparents is nothing to be ashamed
    of.  \r\n\r\n3.  The Toyota sign doesn't bother me.  Corporate stuff all over
    the ballpark doesn't bother me that much.  Rename Wrigley and use all of the money
    from all that stuff to put into the team...sounds great to me."

<p>As we stated yesterday, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5863" target="_blank">Old Style pulled out of their 61-year partnership with the Cubs</a>.  The word is that Old Style will be replaced by Coors Light at Wrigley Field.  I understand the quandary. In the age of massive mergers, everything is owned by a company that you would not want influencing something you care about.  It may not be a strong influence, but there is at least a merging of images.  When I see a case of Old Style at the grocery store, my thoughts wander to the Cubs.  </p>
<p>The Cubs will apparently be going to a beer that owns the naming rights of another team in the National League.  There aren't many "cheap beer" options.  Coors Light is probably more tolerable for fans than Miller Lite, whose image is obviously attached to the Milwaukee Brewers.  Worse yet would be Bud Light, with the connection between Budweiser and the Cardinals.  It's bad enough the bleachers at Wrigley are imprinted with "Bud Light".  </p>
<p>So my choice for the Cubs would be Hamm's.  I like the idea of Old Style's replacement being another beer that is an "old time" beer that reminds people of their grandpa cracking open a can of refreshing beer on a hot day.  Hamm's is more unique than Coors Light and I think us Cubs fans are drawn to these types of brands.  In fact, the Cubs and Hamm's had a partnership in the late 50's and early 60's.  </p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/07/hamms1.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/07/hamms1.jpg" alt="" title="hamms1" width="320" height="306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5879" /></a></center></p>
<p>Hamm's does have a few drawbacks.  Like Coors Light, it is owned by MillerCoors, and I personally disagree with the politics of the Coors family.  However, taking a stance on some principle won't get you very far these days considering the massive corporate parternships.  Whatever your personal convictions, it would be difficult to find any product or service that doesn't involve a person that you find repulsive.  </p>
<p>While Hamm's is identifiably "Minnesota", I don't see this to be too much of a problem.  Minnesota doesn't have a rival of the Cubs within it's borders.  It's an upper-Midwest beer, and it's not attached to the Rockies, Brewers or Cardinals.  While this is a stretch, you could say that Hamm's, or Coors Light for that matter, have Chicago ties now with the headquarters of MillerCoors being located in the city.  </p>
<p>I'm guessing that money will guide this conversation.  I suppose MillerCoors will fork over more money for Coors Light to become the official beer of Wrigley and the Cubs than they would for Hamm's.  </p>
<p>It's entirely possible that most Cubs fans don't care anything about this topic and if given the choice between a $8 Coors Light or a $8 Hamm's, the dudes at Wrigley wearing khaki shorts and cell phones clipped to their belts would go with Coors Light because that was the "cheap beer" they drank at Northwestern.  I'd take the Hamm's.</p>
