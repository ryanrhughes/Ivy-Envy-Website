Joe Maddon is officially the manager of the Chicago Cubs. With a brand new 5 year, $25 million contract, Maddon, along with President of Baseball Operations Theo Epstein and General Manager Jed Hoyer, was introduced as the 54th manager in Cubs history this afternoon at the Cubbie Bear bar across the street from Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>With ripped jeans, no tie, and in a brand new unbuttoned Cubs jersey with his name and the number 70, Maddon began the press conference with a story of the meeting he had with Theo and Jed in Pensacola, Florida. This meeting took place in Maddon's RV, nicknamed Cousin Eddy. During Maddon's intro, he expresses his comfort level with this job, "this is a good fit for me." As the former Rays' manager recalls his trip to Wrigley Field in August, Maddon spoke of a situation while walking out for a pitching change and seeing the bright blue sky. Madden compared it to a cathedral and said it was like a scene from the movie Gladiator. "It's magical," the new Cubs manager stated.</p>
<p>Maddon also addressed the long championship drought for the Cubs calling it, "beautiful," and saying, "why would you not want to accept this challenge?" One of the best quotes of the press conference was Maddon stating, "this is a one in a 107-year opportunity." The new Cubs manager isn't fine with just thinking about contending this year. "I'm going to talk playoffs and World Series next year and I'm going to believe it." This is on parallel tracks to what Theo stated in his "State of the Cubs" address in October that the goal is winning the division in 2015. To go even further, Maddon said the Cubs are going to make the playoffs next year. *faints*</p>
<p>A few more clip notes in the press conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maddon and Theo both addressed the tampering issue. Maddon states that he didn't know of his opt out clause until then Rays' GM Andrew Friedman moved on to the Dodgers and Rays management informed him of it.</li>
<li>The new Cubs skipper preached continuity with Theo, Jed, the Ricketts family, and the coaching staff. Current Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio was mentioned a handful of times by both Theo and Maddon. You would have to think he would be back for 2015. Also, Maddon will sit down with Theo and Jed to discuss the coaching staff and strategy soon, saying they have not spoken about that to this point.</li>
<li>As for the pressure of being the new manager of the Cubs with the championship drought, Maddon stated a phrase that is on top of his lineup card everyday, "don't ever permit the pressure to exceed the pleasure."</li>
<li>Maddon explained his managing style a bit while discussing his players. "The players don't have to be the first on there and the last one to leave to impress me. That has nothing to do with winning. Nothing." Also, Joe said he will continue to roll with a guy in a 2 for 25 like slump, "I understand development. I love development."</li><br />
</ul><br />
Best quotes/moments during the Joe Maddon press conference:</p>
<ul>
<li>About the coaching staff Maddon says, "I play good in the sandbox."</li>
<li>Maddon said "do do" in a sentence and immediately giggled.</li>
<li>Talking about analytics and advanced stats, "you ever see that card in my back pocket? It's dripping in analytics."</li>
<li>Theo talking about the RV meeting with Maddon, "We'll always have Pensacola."</li>
<li>Maddon about managing in the NL, "National League baseball is very cool."</li>
<li>Maddon expressed his thanks for the Rays organization.</li>
<li>The new Cubs manager ends his press conference by saying, "Where is the bar keep? First round is on me. Shot and a beer."</li><br />
</ul><br />
The press conference, in total, lasted 36 minutes. If this press conference was any indication of how these next five years are going to be, Maddon is going to be a fan and media favorite.</p>
