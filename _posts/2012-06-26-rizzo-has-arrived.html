<p>Where do I begin? Listing the impressive minor league stats he put up in Iowa? Giving you a run down of his major league stats that have already been determined by fantasy baseball guys? Or with the incredible expectations that are on both Rizzo and Epstein/Hoyer as their first prospect to make it to Chicago? How about all of the above.</p>
<p>I've had the opportunity to see Rizzo in person on two occasions in Des Moines. One was Sunday in presumably his last complete game as an Iowa Cub. He was pulled in the 4th on Monday and given the news that he would be heading to Chicago. Sunday's game wasn't a typical performance. He was 0-3 with a walk. It looked to me that the Round Rock game plan was to pitch around Rizzo and not let him do too much damage. In the seven games against Round Rock he picked up just four hits in 26 at bats. My only criticism is that he didn't take more than two walks in that stretch since it seemed like the Express were perfectly willing to let him have first base. His performance in the last ten days has actually lowered his average from .367 to .342 and he only hit one home run. I wouldn't worry. It seems like the other PCL teams just got the memo and were starting to give him a little less to hit.</p>
<p><strong>Here are his Iowa totals: 70 games, .342 BA, 88 H, 179 TB, 23 HR, 62 RBI.</strong> He doesn't have many offensive weaknesses. He hit LHP (.313) almost as well as RHP (.356). These elevated numbers will not continue in Chicago. There's a bold prediction for you. After reading a few fantasy run downs it looks they're expecting 12-14 home runs, 35-40 RBI, and around a .275 average. I don't put a lot of stock in fantasy predictions, but I don't think they're too far off. His average will certainly drop facing better pitching and making the adjustment to the show.</p>
<p>I expect him to get off to a good start. Major league pitchers have egos. Egos that will push them to go after the new guy and see if he can hit their best stuff. After a few home runs on to Sheffield and enough ABs to analyze, the pitching coaches will step in with better game plans and he'll level off.</p>
<p>Now for the expectations that he can't control. If Rizzo were a stock IPO, he'd be Facebook. His value has never been higher. Zuckeberg, I mean Epstein, is saying all the right things, but only time will tell if the return will come. And, let's face it, Cubs fans aren't very good investors. We've been burned too many times. We want the next Mr. Cub, but forget that Ernie played 19 years. Hell, a lot of Cubs fans would take another Sammy Sosa. Something to get excited about. The reality is that Anthony Rizzo is a great player who is going to have highs and lows. He can't help the hype. It's the nature of being a highly touted prospect in a big market on a very bad team. Epstein and Hoyer drafted Rizzo in Boston and Hoyer has traded for him twice. He's their guy. They're trying hard to gauge expectations. The haters are ready to tear them apart the moment he goes in to his first slump. My advice, ignore the haters and wait it out.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see two power lefties in a Cubs lineup. The Cubs have been chasing left handed power to hit some balls out of Wrigley for years. It's nice to see a couple guys come from the system and not overpaid free agents.</p>
<p>I wish I could say I was excited to see Rizzo's Cub debut, but the game will be broadcast on local Chicago network, WCIU. MLB considers IvyEny headquarters 180 miles away to be "local", so we're blacked out. I'll leave that discussion for another day and listen to Pat and Zonk call the game. Since I'm harping on things I can't stand I'll throw in a jab at SportsCenter. I don't think anyone in Bristol has heard of Anthony Rizzo. I've been watching for a half hour all I have heard is Yankees, Yankees, Strasburg, BCS, Top Plays, Lebron, Yankees. It won't be long until he gets their attention. Let the Rizzo catch phrase contest begin.</p>
