  content: Can we take a second to talk about how abrupt that well orchestrated Harry's
    ad came from. I'm still reeling from it hours later. Mind got crazy confused.

We don't come to any sort of resolution, other than wishing we weren't faced with this situation.  We sort through stuff a little more on this episode.</p>
<p>We also look at what impact his acquisition has on the bullpen.  We know he can throw hard.  He's always made Cubs hitters look silly, but how good is he?  We look at his shocking numbers.</p>
<p>We have a few listener questions and by the end of the episode we were ready for topics that don't involve Aroldis Chapman.  </p>
