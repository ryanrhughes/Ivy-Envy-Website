<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On the 266th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about Javier Baez's first two series in Major League Baseball.  </p>
<p>We comment on what we've seen in the first six games of his career.  What is he doing well?  What does he need to improve on?  Are the Cubs letting him be who he is?  When will adjustments and the tinkering with his approach begin?  </p>
<p>We also look at the final two months of the 2014 season for the Cubs.  We talk about our expectations, what we'd like to see and how the Cubs can build on these few months for 2015 and beyond.  </p>
<p>The Cubs added a new pitcher to the staff by acquiring Jacob Turner from the Marlins.  Kurt tells us how this deal happened and that Chris Bosio looks to get another reclamation project.  </p>
<p>There were rumors flying after the Cubs claimed Cole Hammels off revocable waivers, but Andy tells us why the deal didn't happen and we speculate as to what it would have taken for that deal to go through.  </p>
<p>Nate Schierholtz was DFA'd and we look at his horrific 2014 campaign and find comfort in that these place-holders like Schierholtz and Barney are being moved away for the more talented players coming up through the system.  </p>
<p>One player that will not be moving anyone aside in 2014 is Kris Bryant.  Theo Epstein says that Bryant will not be promoted to the Cubs this season.  We talk about this issue, look at the timing of the inevitable call-up and look at a few scenarios that the Cubs could face.  </p>
<p>We have a slew of listener questions to answer, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we read a few Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
