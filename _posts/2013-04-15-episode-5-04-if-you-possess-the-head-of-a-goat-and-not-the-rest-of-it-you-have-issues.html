<p><strong><em>We apologize for the drop in sound quality this week.  We lost the recording and had to rip the audio from our live broadcast.</em></strong></p>
<p>The last week was crazy for Cubs fans, from it starting off with a goat head being delivered to Tom Ricketts to Jorge Soler losing his cool to the Cubs signing Kevin Gregg.  We discuss each of these topics.  </p>
<p>We also talk about what's going on with the Cubs on-the-field.  Corey goes to the tape with another of his Carlos Marmol predictions from Episode 5.01 that came true.  Speaking of Marmol, we talk about whether or not fans should boo players that are struggling.  We give the results of our Facebook poll on the topic and tell you what we think.  </p>
<p>There's plenty of negative stuff to talk about, but we find a few positives to note, as well.  Kurt gives us the Scary Stat of the Week, the Internet Muscle Flex makes a cameo and we reveal the winner for this week's photo contest.  </p>
