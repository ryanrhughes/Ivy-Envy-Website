  content: But do you agree that Lee's slow starts are a little frustrating?  I find
    myself mumbling, "what's the problem? Get it moving, guys!"

  content: "Ryne Sandberg was always slow to start the seasons and his Aprils were
    pretty bad.  \r\n\r\nIt is kind of interesting that, as fans, we allow players
    to get of to slow starts, but get real concerned with a slow-starting team.  \r\n\r\nI
    think that it's helped take some heat off Lee and Ramirez for starting slow by
    having 7 players on the team batting over .300."

  content: "At least Lee is drawing walks.  His OBP gives me solace for now.\r\n\r\nMy
    favorite is when someone says, \"Why don't they let that Hoffpauir kid have a
    shot at some playing time?\"\r\n\r\nKid?  The guy is 30 years old.  Also they
    did give him a shot last season and he sucked."

<p>Derrek Lee had another sub-par April this year.  It was pretty remarkable how much I heard "He'll be ok.  He always starts off slow in April."  That's what most logical Cubs fans were saying in April and May of 2009.  There were many Cubs fans ready to jump the Derrek Lee ship.  I heard a surprising number of fans and bloggers calling for the Cubs to bench Lee in favor of Micah Hoffpaiur.  I hosted a Cubs game-watch in my backyard during this time and heard one fan (who will go un-named) say "Bench him?  Release him, he's done.  Go with Hoffpauir, he's awesome."  The Hoffpaiur-hype had some steam.  He was coming off a pretty amazing season with Iowa in 2008.  He batted .362 with 25 homeruns and 100 RBI's in Des Moines.  He was also playing well with the Cubs, gaining the buzz that fans are eager to give "the little guys".</p>

<p>We know how the season transpired for Derrek Lee.  In 2009, Lee batted .306 with 35 homeruns and a career high 111 RBI's.  Let's review 2009 for Micah Hoffpaiur.  Hoffpaiur played in 105 games and finished with a .239 batting average.  He had 10 homeruns and 35 RBI's.</p>
<p>I don't know why this Lee/Hoffpaiur thing sticks in my craw so bad.  I was so irritated by it 12 months ago and I haven't been able to put it behind me.  So how is "The Hoff" doing in Iowa this year?  Through 22 games, Hoffpaiur is batting .182 and a .258 OBP.</p>
<p>I don't have anything against Hoffpaiur.  I'm just glad Hendry/Piniella didn't consider listening to the idiots out there.  It seems that most that held this opinion in 2009 aren't quite as reactionary this year, as I hear some of these same people saying about Lee's slow start, "It's ok, it's April.  He always starts off slowly."</p>
