<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this, the 335<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we try to pick up the pieces from a 2-5 week of Cubs baseball that could have easily been 0-7.  The Cubs struggles are impossible to ignore now.  The offense didn't produce but a strong performances from the pitching staff helped keep things rolling.  But now, the offense is still struggling and those strong pitching performances are coming back down to earth and it hasn't been enough to keep the losses off the board.</p>
<p>We discuss everything going on around the Cubs right now, from these offensive struggles to the upcoming trade deadline.  We answer listener questions, Kurt gives us a scary stat of the week and we read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
