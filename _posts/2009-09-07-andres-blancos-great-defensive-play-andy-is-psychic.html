<p>If you did not get a chance to see Andres Blanco's great play in the field yesterday against the Mets, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?content_id=6498573">here it is</a>.&nbsp; Yes Cubs fans, we have reached the point where we get excited about individual plays in games.&nbsp; Remember the days when we were never in the playoff picture and it was this type of thing that got us excited?&nbsp; At least for the remainder of the 2009 season, this is what we will find pleasure in, when it comes to the Cubs.</p>
<p>I was looking back through old posts and trying to figure out when we started identifying these problems that would plague this team.&nbsp; It was not far into the season, April 10th.&nbsp; <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=537">Andy wrote this post</a>.&nbsp; The line that made me chuckle was "However since there are no trends to worry about yet...."</p>
