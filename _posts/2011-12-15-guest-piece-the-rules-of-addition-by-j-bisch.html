    Guest Piece - "The Rules of Addition" by J Bisch. - Ivy Envy
---
<p><em>A few years ago, we had J Bisch from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garden of Halos</span>, an Angels blog and podcast on the Ivy Envy Podcast to talk about a series between the Angels and the Cubs. I've mentioned before that the Angels are my 2nd favorite team, so I've stayed in contact with J. </p>
<p>When Pujols signed the Angels, as a trigger-shy Cubs fan with Alfonso Soriano in the back of my mind, I was not too happy when I saw Arte Moreno pay almost $80 million more for Pujols than he did the entire Angels organization when he bought it from Disney in 2003. </p>
<p>I had hoped to see Pujols stay in St. Louis and bleed the organization dry. Pujols is past his prime and that price tag would have handicapped the Cardinals from making deals down the road. J, and many Angels fans, greeted Pujols with open arms and celebration. Here is what J has to say about this move:</em></p>
<p><center><strong>The Rules of Addition - By: J Bisch</strong></center><br />
<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pujols-Angels.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-6486" title="Pujols-Angels" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Pujols-Angels-300x182.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="182" /></a><br />
Angels owner Arte Moreno isn&rsquo;t paying Albert Pujols (10 years/$254 million) to carry them. Prior to signing CJ Wilson (five years/$77.5 million), the Halos pitching staff/defense was already the best in the American League at keeping teams from scoring. But baseball involves basic math, so you only win by scoring more runs than you allow.</p>
<p>Last year, the Halos only surrendered an average of three-and-a-half runs per game. But because they couldn&rsquo;t score an average of four runs per game, they lost a plethora of one-run games and finished ten games behind Wilson and the Texas Rangers in the AL West. Enter Albert and his gazillion dollar contract.</p>
<p>Albert was signed to overcome that gap. But the reason Angel fans aren&rsquo;t worried about his performance is because he isn&rsquo;t expected to wear the weight of the world on his shoulders. Instead, the burden of winning will be shared by a top-flight pitching staff, a strong defense and an offense based primarily on speed, with a level of power that&rsquo;s been underachieving since Kendrys Morales&rsquo; unathletic leap onto home plate after his miraculous game-winning grand slam in 2010. Albert&rsquo;s presence will take pressure off outfielders Torii Hunter and Vernon Wells &ndash; the latter of whom will be rebounding from a horrific 2011 &ndash; and help INF/DH Mark Trumbo, who was easily the team&rsquo;s offensive MVP in his rookie season last year.</p>
<p>On top of that, the Halos also added the aforementioned Wilson to an already-impressive staff. And in the wake of that signing, the Rangers must now find someone who can win the 16 games CJ was responsible for last season.</p>
<p>And as far as Arte Moreno spending so much money on two players&hellip; Chalk that up to buying a team that had just won the World Series, then missed the playoffs the last two years after they couldn&rsquo;t close deals on free agents like Mark Teixeira and Carl Crawford. Arte is tired of losing in front of the three million fans that flock to 82 games every year, and he&rsquo;s tired of waiting for minor leaguers to develop. It&rsquo;s also clear that after owning a somewhat successful franchise since 2003, he wants nothing more than to sit atop a fire truck and lead a championship parade through the city of Anaheim. And he wants to do it now.</p>
<p>So he went out and signed a 20-year, $3 billion TV contract with Fox, personally called Albert Pujols twice in forty-eight hours while he was deciding between the Cards and Marlins, and signed a 2011 All-Star pitcher from the division rival.</p>
<p>The fans aren&rsquo;t worried about Albert&rsquo;s big contract. Nor are they worried about where the owner&rsquo;s heart is. And that&rsquo;s because they both add up to the goal of a championship.</p>
