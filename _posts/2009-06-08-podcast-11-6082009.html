  content: "Jason could give a real answer, but I think it's because there was so
    much yelling and \"peaking\" or whatever, when you normalize the file, it keeps
    the overall volume pretty low.\r\n\r\nIt would be our faults, not Jason's."

<p>***Warning.&nbsp; This is not your usual Ivy Envy podcast***</p>
<p>We mix things up a little bit for this episode.&nbsp; In other words, get ready for a shit-storm.&nbsp; Jeremiah Weed Bourbon, 40's of malt liquor and Jose Cuervo fuel the episode.&nbsp; If you are offended by swears, skip the episode.&nbsp; The fun-loving spirit fades away as things turn quite serious towards the end.</p>
<p>Those in attendance:&nbsp; Corey, Andy, Kurt and Paul</p>
