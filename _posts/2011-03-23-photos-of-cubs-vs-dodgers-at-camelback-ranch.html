  content: I am looking at your website for the first time. Very exciting. I look
    forward to getting the Quad City Cub fans perspective. I am 61 years old. A Chicago
    area resident for 58 years. As a teen, i spent many weekends in the left field
    bleachers and became addicted to our Cubs. Moving here, away from Sox fans, has
    been refreshing. But now i have Cardinal Nation to deal with. Never let it be
    said Cub fans don't have character. Best to your broadcast team. I will be reading
    and listening . GO CUBS

  content: Thanks for finding the site, Kurt.  Dealing with Cardinals fans can be
    difficult, but the key is surrounding yourself with enough Cubs fans to drown
    them out.
