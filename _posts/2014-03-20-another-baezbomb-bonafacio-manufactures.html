<p>If you have the MLB Network and were willing to watch a late-night meaningless Spring Training Cubs game, you were treated to a nice little #BaezBomb show last night as the Rockies hosted the Cubs under the lights in the Arizona desert Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Javier Baez did not start the game, after a few games of starts at 2<sup>nd</sup> base. He did come in to pinch-hit in the 8<sup>th</sup> inning, with the Cubs trailing 5-2, and treated every Cubs fan in the stands and watching on TV (or MLB.com) by hitting a 2-2 pitch WAY over the center field wall. After the home run, I saw on Twitter that it was estimated at 452 feet.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=31593231&amp;topic_id=26663958&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=mlb" height="224" width="400" frameborder="0"></iframe></center></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
To quote the Rockies broadcaster, "That was REALLY, REALLY far."</p><br />
Then, in the bottom of the 8<sup>th</sup> the Cubs and fans held our collective breaths as Baez chased down a fly ball in shallow left field and collided with Anthony Giansanti. Initially, it looked like a leg injury as their legs are what collided. Trainers couldn't get to Baez fast enough and once they did, it was clear it was Baez's wrist and not his legs that required some attention. It's probably a good thing that Giansanti was fine because it would have been real awkward when the Cubs medical staff, coaching staff, Theo, Jed, the entire Ricketts family and Clark the Cub dashed out to check on Baez while Giansanti laid injured and unattended a few feet away.</p>
<p>Baez's home run Wednesday night was his 5<sup>th</sup> of Spring Training - his 5<sup>th</sup> solo, by the way. For a lot of Cubs fans that have justifiably become uninterested in the Cubs over the last 3 or 4 years, they are now seeing what a lot of us have been so excited and optimistic about as we've watched Baez and others navigate the minor league system. So a lot of fans are going to have a difficult time seeing Baez head to Des Moines in a few weeks and the Luis Valbuena/Donnie Murphy tandem take over at 3<sup>rd base. It's just the way it has to be. </sup></p>
<p>The starting line-up in the game was a similar to a line-up we'll see in April (yawn). Besides the prospects, one of the things that has interested me this spring is Emilio Bonafacio, Darwin Barney and the 2<sup>nd</sup> base situation. In the first inning, we saw what Bonafacio can bring to a game. He drew a walk, went from 1<sup>st</sup> to 3<sup>rd</sup> on an error by Rockies 1<sup>st</sup> baseman, Justin Morneau, quickly got back to the bag on a sharp groundball hit right to the bag, and then scored on a infield groundball off the bat of Justin Ruggiano. It was a run completely generated by Bonafacio's speed and threat of speed.</p>
<p>Bonafacio ended the game 1-3 with a walk and two runs scored. I really like Darwin Barney, but Bonafacio brings so much more to a team that will really struggle to score runs. It will be real interesting to see how things work out with this <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/twig-jam-infield-podcast-episode-6-05/" target="_blank">twig jam</a> (as opposed to a log jam) in the infield to start the 2014 season.</p>
<p>After being down 5-2 before Baez entered the game in the 8<sup>th</sup>, the Cubs rallied with three runs in the 9<sup>th</sup> to go up 6-5, but it wasn't enough as the Rockies up up four runs in the bottom of the frame to win 9-6. Do you need reminding that losing the lead and the game in the 9<sup>th</sup> doesn't matter? The Rockies rallied off the pitching of Cubs pitcher Paola Espino. The important take-away is that Baez crushed a baseball and is not injured.</p>
