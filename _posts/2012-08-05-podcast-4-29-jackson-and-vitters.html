<p>Andy, Bob from Moline and Corey start things off by welcoming Brian Bedo from <a href="http://micubs.com" target="_blank">miCubs.com</a> on to talk about Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters getting called up to the Cubs today.  MiCubs was on the front edge of the news and always do a great job of covering the Cubs and their entire system.  Brian gives a very good explanation of why the Cubs may have brought Brett Jackson up right now, even though he has been struggling in AAA, especially with strikeouts.  </p>
<p>Then we look at all of the trades the Cubs have made in the last week and give you a little information on all the players that the Cubs acquired in the trades.  We look at some listener suggested topics and questions and then pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
