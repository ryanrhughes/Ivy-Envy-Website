On this episode, we go back and draw a line at the Cardinals series almost two weeks ago and look at these last two weeks of Cubs baseball.  The team had a bit of a rough stretch (slightly under .500 for a week or 10 days), and they have gone 10-3 since that point.  </p>
<p>We also discuss the middle and back end of this rotation, focusing on Lackey, Hammel and Hendricks.  With all 5 of the Cubs starters sporting ERAs under 3.00, these are the guys that stand out the most because you wouldn't expect the back end of a rotation to be so dominant.  </p>
<p>We cover lots of topics on the episode, including a scary stat of the week and a couple of internet muscle flexes.  </p>
