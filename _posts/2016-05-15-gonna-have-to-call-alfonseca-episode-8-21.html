<p>On this episode, we talk about the Cubs series win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. There's a lot of positives to discuss, and apparently the Pirates players and fans:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't like getting destroyed by the Cubs, who lead the season series 5-1 vs. the Pirates.</li>
<li>Don't think the Cubs are the best team in baseball, even though that 5-1 record (and 18 games over .500 in mid-May) would say otherwise.</li><br />
</ol><br />
So we talk a little about the drama in this series, although most, if not all of it came from the Pirates dugout and fanbase.  </p>
<p>Kurt shares a Jon Lester scary stat that is a good example of why you shouldn't pay attention to pitcher win-loss records. </p>
<p>On this episode, we premiere Katie Day's new version of her song, "By the Lakeside."  Anyone that purchased this song through the embed below by Tuesday (May 17, 2016) night at midnight Pacific time will have their name entered into a drawing for a free Ivy Envy shirt.  </p>
