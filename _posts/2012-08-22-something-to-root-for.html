    of the proper "Something for which to root".

<p>Normally I would save my stat negativity for the scary stat of the week, but the numbers worked out that this should be shared before the start of Wednesday's game against the Brewers. The Cubs' current record is 47-75 for a .385 winning percentage. Should the Cubs play their final 40 games at a similar winning percentage it will give them 15 wins and 25 losses (that's a .375 WP, 16 wins would be a .400 WP) giving them exactly 100 losses&mdash;a mark they haven't reached since <a title="1966 Cubs" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1966.shtml" target="_blank">1966</a> when they finished with 103 losses and their worst ever record.</p>
<p>If you're a little worn out trying to be interested in B-Jax trying to strike out less and Vitters' defensive trial by fire, here's a new milestone to root for. That the Cubs don't lose 100 games, improve over the final stretch of 40 games and keep the losses to two digits. Go Cubs.</p>
