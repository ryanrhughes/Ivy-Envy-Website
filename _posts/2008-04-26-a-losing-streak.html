<p>Last night, the Cubs matched their longest losing streak of this short season...two games.&nbsp; I suppose this hurts more because it comes at the end of a six game winning streak and a 9-1 stretch.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-39"></a></p>
<p>I was not able to witness Reed Johnson's catch or the tragic 9th inning.&nbsp; One of my bands, <a href="www.myspace.com/thelioninrome">The Lion in Rome</a> was playing a show out of town, so I had to resort to watching the game via 30-second refreshes from MLB.com on my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During most Cubs seasons, I wouldn't even take notice of a two game "skid".&nbsp; But these two games have brought those painful memories flooding back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rest easy though, fellow Cubs fans.&nbsp; Carlos Zambrano takes the hill tonight.&nbsp; The Nationals are a bad team that are probably just using up some good vibes left in the stadium by the Pope.&nbsp; The Nationals have Matt Chico on the mound.&nbsp; He's lost every game he's started this year.&nbsp; He's 0-4 with an ERA over 6.00.&nbsp; Plus he's from USC, so he's obviously a giant douchebag.</p>
