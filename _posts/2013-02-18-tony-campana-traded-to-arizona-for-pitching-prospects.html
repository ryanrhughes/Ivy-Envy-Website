<p>Tony Campana was designated for assignment a week ago and the Cubs had 10 days to trade Campana before he went on waivers.  Today, the Cubs moved the fan-favorite to the Arizona Diamondbacks for two 17-year old pitchers, Erick Leal and Jesus Castillo.  </p>
<p><strong>Erick Leal</strong> turns 18 next month and pitched last season with the Dominican Summer League.  The right-handed pitcher started 12 games and had a 6-2 record with a 2.44 ERA.  In his one season, Leal pitched 70 innings and gave up just 1 homerun.  He had 9 strikeouts and 1.4 walks per 9 innings pitched.  Last August, Arizona Snake Pit <a href="http://www.azsnakepit.com/2012/8/4/3219874/diamondbacks-top-60-prospects-updated-8-4" target="_blank">ranked him #35</a> in the Diamondback's minor league system.  According to Jed Hoyer, Leal will probably be in the Cubs minor league system this year.  </p>
<p><strong>Jesus Castillo</strong> was acquired in the trade and will most likely be in the Dominican Summer League to start the 2013 season.  Castillo, who turns 18 in August, is also a right-handed pitcher that spent last season in the Dominican Summer League.  Castillo sported a 2-4 record with a 5.40 ERA in 14 games, 8 of which were games he started.  </p>
<p>I'm sure many Cubs fans are horrified that Campana is actually gone.  They probably held out hopes that he would clear waivers and then stay in the Cubs system and go to Iowa.  If you still need to understand why losing the one-tool Campana is not a big deal, listen to the Tony Campana scary stats in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-56-ill-get-crooked-with-ya/" target="_blank">Episode 4.56 of The Ivy Envy Podcast</a>.  </p>
