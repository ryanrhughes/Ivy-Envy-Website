<p>Well, a loss like this is enough to bring be out of my nearly month-long Ivy Envy hibernation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Folks, THAT is how the Cubs lose a ball game.&nbsp; That is the most heartbreaking way to lose a 4-3 game.&nbsp; Chopper up the middle for a double play to end the game?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; If I needed to explain to people <a id="more"></a><a id="more-217"></a>&nbsp;the history of the Chicago Cubs, and I only had 5 minutes to explain our losing ways, I would show them the last 5 minutes of this game.&nbsp; I would also explain how bad the Reds are and that they have nothing to gain with a loss other than to stick it to the boys in blue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read this looking for some in-depth analysis, forget it.&nbsp; I have been away from Ivy Envy too long.&nbsp; I promise to write something worth-while at some point.&nbsp; The worst thing is that I knew this game was going to fall apart the way that it did.&nbsp; I started writing this post before the game was even over.</p>
