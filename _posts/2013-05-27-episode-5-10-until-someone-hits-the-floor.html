    started listening to you guys this year and I am really enjoying it.&nbsp; I been
    a Cubs fan for quite a few years; living in Des Moines is almost natural if you

<p>We are just 2 episodes from #200 and we're inviting you to celebrate with us for the weekend.  Details can be found at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/200" target="_blank">ivyenvy.com/200</a></p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-9.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/photo-9-300x224.jpg" alt="photo-9" width="300" height="224" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8323" /></a></center></p>
<p>The Cubs have had a rough week, winning just 2 of their last 9, including a lot of 1-run games.  Matt Garza has returned and has two starts on the 2013 season now.  We talk about his performances and a situation that he interjected himself into between Johnny Cueto and David DeJesus.  Then, Dusty Baker worked his way into the discussion.  We talk about slow batters and the reputation the Reds have developed.  </p>
<p>The Crosstown Classic started just a few hours after we recorded and we talk about what the series means to us.  Things aren't quite as exciting now that Zambrano, Michael Barrett, Lou Piniella, AJ Pierzynski and Ozzie Guillen aren't involved.  </p>
<p>We go through some listener questions and talk about the Cubs options in the 2013 MLB draft, which high profile players in the minor league system could be trade bait and our opinions on Jim DeShaies.</p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
