<p>After yesterday&rsquo;s heartbreaker, I am sure most fans are in a melancholic mood. Here are a few club updates, from today.</p>
<p><strong>The Chicago Cubs placed Justin Ruggiano on the 15-day disabled list.</strong><br />
He was injured attempting to make a play in Right Field. His injury is currently being listed as a Grade 2 strain. He will be out for at least three weeks.</p>

<p><strong>RHP Neil Ramirez and LHP Zac Rosscup have been called up.</strong><br />
Ramirez is the latest player to make the Majors from the Matt Garza trade. He will likely come in to do some short relief pitching. He currently has a 7.71 ERA (6ER/7.0 IP) That doesn't sound great, but he did spend the majority of spring training going scoreless in 7.2 innings and getting two saves. It should be interesting to see how he pitches at this level. He was a top pitching prospect, for the Texas Rangers, before he had health issues. He is a three pitch guy. Ramirez has a fastball that can reach 98, but tends to be in the 91-96mph range. His two other pitches are a plus curveball and a plus changeup.</p>
<p>Rosscup is back with the club for the second time this year. In Iowa, he is 1-0 with a 4.28 ERA (3ER/6.1 IP). Expect to see him in a similar role as Ramirez. He throws four pitches. They are all considered average, but he also doesn't walk a ton of guys. Those four pitches are a fastball, curve, changeup, and slider.</p>
<p><strong>Blake Parker has been demoted to Iowa.</strong><br />
He was moved to make space but also because he has an ERA of 16.20 (3ER/1.2 IP) in two outings this year.</p>
<p><strong>In none player related news;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cubs 400 pound birthday cake was thrown in a dumpster.</strong><br />
I'm sure most Cubs fans saw the cake from Wrigley Field's birthday. It took six bakers hours to make the cake, but only a few moments for someone to throw it into a dumpster. You can read the <a href="http://deadspin.com/the-cubs-400-pound-wrigley-cake-is-sitting-in-a-dumpste-1567177257" target="_blank">entire story here</a>. If anything sums up how we all feel today, this is image seems to do it justice.</p>
<p><strong>The Cubs haven't won a World Series in 100+ years, but they did win the Cold War.</strong><br />
Stephen Colbert had Pulitzer prize winner, George Will, on his show. Will was there to promote his new book about Wrigley Field. The interview is pretty funny and I think most will enjoy.</p>
