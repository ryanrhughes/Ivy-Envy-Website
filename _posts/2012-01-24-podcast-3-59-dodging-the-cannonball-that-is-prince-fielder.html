<p>Andy joins Corey through Skype.  Marlon Byrd reportedly drops 40 lbs and we consider what this could mean to his performance on the field.  Darwin Barney supposedly puts on 18 pounds.  Andy shares his knowledge of exercise and weight training and we try to figure where and why Barney put this weight on.</p>
<p>Some of the guys in the Cubs' minor league system (Brett Jackson, Anthony Rizzo, Javier Baez, Dan Vogelbach) are rated highly in the prospect rankings on MLB.com and we look at the players and discuss their progression and the expectations.  We also consider the future infield of Rizzo, Baez, Lake and Castro.  </p>
<p>Carlos Pena is officially an ex-Cub and we reflect on his short stint with the Cubs.  Prince Fielder is reportedly signing with the Tigers.  The Astros consider changing their name when they move to the American League and we read some of names that our listeners submitted. </p>
<p>We then look at some of your suggested topics, such as the idea of the Cubs entering a new era, a bizarre workout video from the Idaho Cubs, Yoenis Cespedes and how we would construct a MLB team from scratch.  </p>
