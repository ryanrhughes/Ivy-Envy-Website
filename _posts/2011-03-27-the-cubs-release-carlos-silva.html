  content: "I think it's interesting that Silva didn't realize that he IS an insurance
    player at this point in his career.  I mean, every athlete will insist that they
    are in their prime, but doesn't the market technically dictate what \"type\" of
    player you are?  I find that extremely confusing.  And in the end, the market
    DID dictate that he had no trade value.  \r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to watching
    what Cashner can do, and I'm obviously open to anything after last year.  It's
    not ideal that we eat that eleven and a half million dollars, but as Corey said
    we still got the better of the deal and sometimes you just have to cut your losses
    and move forward."

  content: And one more thing, anybody with a 10.90 ERA in Spring Training doesn't
    deserve to make any starting rotation, I don't care what squad you're on.  So
    I guess I would edit the fact that the market dictates what type of player you
    are but of course your performance is how you'll be judged in the end.  And he
    didn't perform so it's time to move on.

<p>Kurt and I were somewhere in Kansas, returning from Spring Training, when the Twitter updates started filtering in that the Cubs informed Carlos Silva that there is no spot for him on the 25-man roster.  This news comes less than a year after Silva started the 2010 season 8-0.  Most Cubs fans had a pretty good hunch that this start was fools gold.</p>
<p>Silva was, to most people, the only way the Cubs could unload clubhouse malcontent, Milton Bradley.  The Cubs got 8-10 good games from Silva, and they are pretty lucky they got that.  Silva has had a pretty awful Spring Training, though Kurt and I did witness a pretty stellar Silva pitching performance. &nbsp;On Wednesday, Silva took the mound in what everyone knew was his "do or die" start against the Oakland A's. &nbsp;Silva pitched well, going 6 innings and giving up 1 run on 3 hits and earned the win. &nbsp;According to my disjointed score-card, Silva retired 17 of the last 18 batters he faced. &nbsp;Silva&nbsp;ended the spring 1-2 with a 10.90 ERA.&nbsp;He also grabbed headlines in his first outing in the spring by getting into a tussle with Aramis Ramirez.  Silva has maintained that he deserves, and should not need to earn a rotation spot.  He's essentially blamed his performance this spring on the added pressure from fighting for a spot.</p>
<p>There were people out there that criticized Mike Quade on his public reaction to the Silva/Ramirez situation.  I would say that Quade definitely handled this situation the right way.  Within a month, Silva is off the team and the Cubs are moving on.  Imagine the media explosion if Quade would have kicked Silva off the team a day or two after the scuffle.  Quade downplayed, but understood the situation.  He handled it in a calm and collected fashion that benefits the Cubs and brings some more stability to the day-to-day runnings of the organization.</p>
<p>The Cubs told Silva that they would try to trade him.  If they were unable to trade him, they'd like him to go spend some time in the minors in Iowa.  "No chance," <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110326&amp;content_id=17132362&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Silva said Saturday</a> about whether he'd go to Triple-A Iowa. "That's not in my mind right now, not at all. I'm not an insurance player. My guess is that's what they want."</p>
<p>So this morning, the Cubs released Silva and will pay him the reported $11.5 million left on his contract. &nbsp;I am glad to see this. &nbsp;If the Cubs were able to trade Carlos Silva, they would have probably had to take on another player with issues that a team is looking to abandon. &nbsp;The Cubs are forking over that money to be done with the Milton Bradley/Carlos Silva era. &nbsp;Given the continued drama surrounding Bradley, the Cubs still probably got the better end of the deal. &nbsp;However, this situation is one of the decisions made by GM Jim Hendry that his critics will put near the top of the list of his bad moves.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the biggest story in this situation is that Andrew Cashner has secured the 5th spot in the starting rotation. &nbsp;With Darwin Barney, and now Andrew Cashner, the youngsters are infiltrating the starting line-up and I think given Mike Quade's years of minor league experience, the Cubs have the right guy at the helm to make this transition from over-paid and under-producting superstars to homegrown talent.</p>
