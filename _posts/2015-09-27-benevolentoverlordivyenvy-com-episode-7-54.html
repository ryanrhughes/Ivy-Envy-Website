<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this, the 350<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the Cubs clinching a post-season appearance for the first time since 2008.  We talk about the series loss to the Pirates and discuss some takeaways from these games with the team the Cubs will likely face in the wild card game.  </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very likely that the next week of games will have no bearing on the Cubs position in the post-season, so we talk about where we think we&rsquo;ll emotionally be in the next week.  It&rsquo;s the calm before the storm.  Let&rsquo;s hope it&rsquo;s a long, sustained storm and not a flash flood.  </p>
<p>We have several listener questions, a scary stat of the week, internet muscle flexes and lots more on this episode.  </p>
