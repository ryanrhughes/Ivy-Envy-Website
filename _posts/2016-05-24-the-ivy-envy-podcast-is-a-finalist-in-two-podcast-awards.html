<p>Within 24 hours, our podcast has been named a finalist in two separate podcast awards.  We are blown away and humbled by this news.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Academy of Podcasters</u></strong><br />
<img data-id="11875"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-23-at-1.00.47-PM-300x105.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-23 at 1.00.47 PM" width="300" height="105" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11875" />This morning, we were announced as a finalist in the sports category of the <a href="http://academyofpodcasters.com/nominees/" target="_blank">Academy of Podcasters Awards</a>.  To quote the Academy of Podcasters website, <em>"The AofP awards recognize and honor the best podcasters in their given niches and categories of podcasting."</em></p>
<p>Finalists and winners are <a href="http://academyofpodcasters.com/academy-members/" target="_blank">selected by the academy</a> and if you browse through the nominees and see the names (Marc Maron, Adam Carolla, Joe Rogan, Chris Harwick, Snoop Dogg, Dan Carlin, Bill Simmons, etc.) and podcasts (Serial, The Moth, No Agenda, Freakonomics, various NPR podcasts, etc.) you will understand why we are so thrilled to be listed as a finalist.  We are the most DIY podcast in the sports category and I can say without question that we would not be on that list if it were not for our dedicated listeners and Patreon supporters.  </p>
<p>The cool thing about the Academy of Podcasters awards is that the ceremony is being held on Wednesday, July 6th in in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency.  The public is invited to attend and there is no admission fee.  We would love to have some Chicago-area listeners in the audience.  </p>
<p><strong><u>11th Annual Podcast Awards</strong></u><br />
<img data-id="11878"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-23-at-1.22.36-PM-300x117.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-05-23 at 1.22.36 PM" width="300" height="117" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11878" />For the third year in a row, The Ivy Envy Podcast is a finalist in the sports category of <a href="http://podcastawards.com" target="_blank">the Podcast Awards</a>.  </p>
<p>Being a finalist in these awards is special because in addition to being judged on sound quality, website, etc., the judges also take into consideration listener engagement through their nomination and voting process.  About a month ago, we asked our listeners to nominate us for these awards and we are so grateful for those of you that took a few minutes to nominate the podcast.  </p>
<p>The voting process for the winners of these awards starts on Sunday, May 29<sup>th</sup>.  Stay tuned to our social media outlets like <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for updates on how to vote. </p>
<p>Being included as finalists in both of these awards is a complete thrill.  On behalf of Andy and Kurt, I'd like to thank all of you for being part of the Ivy Envy community.  We feel honored that you let us into your cars and earbuds twice a week.  </p>
<p>Go Cubs!</p>
