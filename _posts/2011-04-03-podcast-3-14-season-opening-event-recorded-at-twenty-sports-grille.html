<p>This episode was recorded live at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline.  Corey, Kurt, Paul, Ryan and guest Matt Veto discuss the Cubs' Opening Day loss to the Pirates and Carlos Silva being released by the Cubs.  We share what player interests us the most in this 2011 season and choose a winner for the weekly photo caption contest.  Towards the end of the recording, we welcome the only Pirates fan at Twenty, Scott Morschhauser on mic and then share our predictions for the final record for the Cubs this year.  </p>
