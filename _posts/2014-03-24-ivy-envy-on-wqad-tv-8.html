<p>Last night, I had the opportunity to go on <strong><a href="http://wqad.com/2014/03/23/the-score-sunday-illinois-iowa-basketball-ivy-envy-fca/#ooid=k0eG9jbDqLDM6m4A465Ih1UYAzBH9cXj" target="_blank">The Score Sunday</a></strong> a local sports show on WQAD TV-8, the ABC affiliate in the Quad Cities.  Kory Kuffler is the host of the program and we talked about Ivy Envy, the 9th Annual Podcast Awards and then spent most of the time talking about the 2014 Cubs and what the future may hold for the team and the organization.  I always enjoy talking baseball with Kory and I look forward to doing it again.  </p>
