    stating that it will broadcast 87 games this season&#8211;&#8220;the most in network
    history,&#8221; and earlier this month, we reported that 45 games will be aired
    by WQAD&#8217;s My TV 8-3 substation. [&#8230;]"

<p>According to the&nbsp;<em>Quad City Times</em>, the first broadcast will be the April 7th game against the Cardinals, and that game is a WGN-TV game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be surprising if the Quad City ABC affiliate would only get the WGN-TV games and not the ABC-7 games, so it is a safe bet that&nbsp;there will be another announcement about the remaining 25 games forthcoming. </p>
<p><strong>***UPDATE - 8:26PM***</strong><br />
A WQAD representative has stated they will only carry the 45 WGN-9 broadcasts.  They will not be airing the WLS ABC-7 games.  </p>
