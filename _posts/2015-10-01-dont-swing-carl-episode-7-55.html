On this episode, we share some post-season plans and resist talking too much about the post-season.  We'll have plenty of opportunities to talk about that.  List to the podcast to hear about those opportunities.</p>
<p>We begin wrapping up the 2015 season and briefly talk about the 3-game domination over the Reds that the Cubs just wrapped up.  We talk curses, Bartman, player nicknames, definitions of success and how many world series championships we want in a row.  </p>
