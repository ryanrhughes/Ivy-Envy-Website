  content: The Bradley out at second really pissed me off, and Theriot trotting home
    pissed me off too. Last nights games was one of those games that leaves you mad
    at the cubs even though they won. If it wasn't for Marquis' shitty  job on the
    mound (he walked the pitcher with the bases loaded, for christ's sake), they would
    have been beaten easily.

    that.. when was the last time you did have confidence in the Cubs?

    least?

  content: "No.  I've never been completely confident in the Cubs.  Ever.  Seriously.
    \ I watched the '03 Cubs/Marlins series with Jacob when we lived in California.
    \ Ask him if I was confident.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that the most confident I have
    ever been with the Cubs is 1989 going into the playoff series against the Giants.
    \ I was young and naive.  "

  content: Confidence and rooting have nothing to do with eachother.  If you're a
    confident Cubs fan, you're an idiot to be "confident" of a team that chokes regularly
    and hasn't won in over 100 years.

<p>In yesterday's podcast, we discussed the Cubs chances of winning the division or the wildcard.&nbsp;&nbsp; I said something to the effect that I didn't think the Cubs would make it in the playoffs unless they show some urgency.&nbsp; I believe it was Andy that asked me what that exactly means.</p>
<p>Showing a sense of urgency or hunger to win is <strong>not</strong> loafing it to second base on a hit off the wall and getting thrown out like Milton Bradley did.&nbsp; It is also <strong>not</strong> loafing it around third and barely scoring like Ryan Theriot did.&nbsp; This is precisely why I am not confident with this team.&nbsp; I can't think back to a team that showed such little effort or hustle.&nbsp; Do they still think this division is a cake-walk, even though it's August and they are not in first place?</p>
<p>It seems that every Cubs fan I've talked to in the last week is falling more in love with Bob Brenly and his willingness to publicly call these players out on their lack of effort.&nbsp; I think he's a good broadcaster and I can only hope that the next manager for the Chicago Cubs will demand that the players earn their inflated salaries.</p>
