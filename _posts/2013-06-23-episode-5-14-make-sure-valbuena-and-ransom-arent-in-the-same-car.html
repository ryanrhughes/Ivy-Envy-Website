<p>In our first multi-time zone episode in two years, we struggle through some technical issues to talk some Cubs baseball.  Kurt tells you why he wants Valbuena to take a pitch to the ribs.  We also talk a lot about the upcoming trade period and who we would like to see with the team next year that isn't necessarily in the long-term plans for the team.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us an old-school scary stat of the week, Corey reads a few internet muscle flexes and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
