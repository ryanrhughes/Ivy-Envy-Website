<p>You know, it hasn&rsquo;t been difficult at all to find scary stats recently.&nbsp; Today&rsquo;s scary stat shows how much the Cubs just handed the division over to the Cardinals.</p>
<p>The last time the Cubs gained any ground on the Cardinals was August 3<sup>rd</sup>.&nbsp; The Cubs beat the Reds and the Cardinals did not play.&nbsp; So the Cubs gained a &frac12; game.&nbsp; The last time the Cubs gained a full game on the Cardinals was July 30<sup>th</sup>, forty days ago.&nbsp; On July 30<sup>th</sup>, the Cubs were in first place in the division and led the Cardinals by .5 games.</p>
<p>If a rabbit conceived on the last day the Cubs gained ground on the Cardinals, it&rsquo;s babies would be a week old.</p>
