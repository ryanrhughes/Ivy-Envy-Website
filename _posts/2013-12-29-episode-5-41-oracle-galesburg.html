<p>In this, the last episode of 2013, Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the events in the last few weeks with the Cubs.  Tanaka has been posted and he will choose a team by January 24th at 4pm.  We talk about where the Cubs fit in with the Japanese free agent.  Where does he fit into the Cubs timeline?  Why would he choose the Cubs?  These are just a few of the questions we address.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have signed a handful of players to minor league contracts.  We talk about Tsuyoshi Wada, Jonathan Sanchez, Tommy Hottovoy and Mitch Maier.   </p>
<p>Since this is the last episode of 2013, we share our baseball related New Year's resolutions.  We read a few Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>

<p>Next week's episode will be a pre-recorded interview.  I will be in Las Vegas for the 9th Annual Podcast Awards.  Thanks to you, the listeners, we are finalists in the Sports category for the Podcast Awards.  Thank you for your support.  It really means a lot to us.  </p>
