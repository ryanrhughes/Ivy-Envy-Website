<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss Bob Brenly's departure from the Cubs.  We take the opportunity to comment on all of the broadcasters.  Then, we run through the players from the Cubs organization that are playing in the Arizona Fall League.  We still haven't come up with an official name for our new segment.  We browse through Cubs.com articles and pick out the most absurd comment.  Corey finds two and Kurt finds another.  Then, we look at this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>You can watch us do these podcast recordings live in the off-season.  We record on Tuesdays at 8:30pm Central and broadcast live at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/live</a></p>
