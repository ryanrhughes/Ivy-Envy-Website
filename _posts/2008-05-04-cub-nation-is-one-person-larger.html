<p>Yesterday morning, my wife gave birth to our second daughter.&nbsp; Mallory Mae was born at 7:01am.&nbsp; She was 9 lbs. 2 oz and 20 inches long.&nbsp; We held off on naming her until the Cubs played in the afternoon because if Ted Lilly threw a no-hitter, <a id="more"></a><a id="more-60"></a>we were going to name her Lilly Mae.&nbsp; Of course, it didn't happen, but I'll be glad to always tell her that the day she was born, the Cubs beat the Cardinals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good thing my parents didn't take the approach towards naming me that we were taking with Mallory.&nbsp; Granted, he didn't throw a no-hitter, but the Cubs won on the day I was born.&nbsp; In fact, I was born probably in the 3rd or 4th inning of the game.&nbsp; But the starting pitcher for the Cubs that day was Bruce Sutter.&nbsp; I like Corey more than Bruce.</p>
