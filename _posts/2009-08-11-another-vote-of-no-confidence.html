<p>Here is an addendum to Corey's scary stat post--After tonight's demoralizing loss to the Phillies at home (is there any morale left?), <strong>the Cubs are now 19-31 against teams that have a record above .500</strong>.&nbsp; The Cubs have not shown that they can beat the "big boys" this year.&nbsp; This terrible record is an indication to me that the Cubs probably do not belong in the playoffs.&nbsp; The chances of the Cubs doing any damage in the playoffs (and possibly even just making it) are probably equal to someone sliding down a giant ramp, flying 35 meters through the air, and landing in a wading pool.</p>

<p>Let's move the pool a little and have Kevin Gregg give it a try.</p>
