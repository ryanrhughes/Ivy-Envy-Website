<p>After a week off, we are back to briefly comment on the 2013 MLB playoffs.  With the Pirates bowing out, we have lost all interest.  </p>
<p>The Cubs aren't able to lure Joe Girardi and his family from New York.  Ryan Sweeney signs a deal with the Cubs and we look at the organization's players that are in the Arizona Fall League.  </p>
<p>We read a couple of Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
