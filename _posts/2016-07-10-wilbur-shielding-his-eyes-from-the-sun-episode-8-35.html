  content: My one actual worry/concern is Arrieta and Lester. &nbsp;This team
    isn't 6-15 bad with those two pitching poorly over the long run, but they could
    be pretty mediocre for a while. &nbsp;I think we can make moves to improve the
    bullpen. &nbsp;Guys will get healthy and rested and our RISP luck will improve.
    &nbsp;But I'm not positive that Arrieta and Lester can turn it around again any
    time soon. &nbsp;Arrieta's command has been off all season and now it appears
    the league has figured out how to approach him in this mode. Lester looked like
    he was throwing to first base in some of those innings.

  content: So, for some reason this episode isn't showing up in my podcast app...
    Am I the only one having a problem?   I'm using Pocket Casts on ios.    This is
    the first time I've ever had a problem.    I can just  listen to it through the
    website, it's not a big deal because I knew to look for the episode.  I just  thought
    I'd mention it in case there is an actual issue - others might not realize there
    is an episode if it doesn't show up in their app.

  content: Someone else told me the same thing. I use Pocketcast on iOS and it showed
    up fine for me.  I'm not sure what the deal is.

Holy cow, has it been a rough stretch for us Cubs fans. Cubs fans are feeling varying levels of frustration and panic, and we're no immune to these feelings.  On this episode, we share some stats and do our best to identify where the problem areas are for the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We try to gauge our concern, which as sports fans, varies by the moment...or pitch. These 24 straight days of Cubs games have not been fun, so this is your chance to listen to us complain and attempt to evaluate the team, and ourselves.  </p>
