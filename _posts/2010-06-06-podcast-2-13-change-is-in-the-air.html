  content: "Most upset I have ever been about the Cubs losing somebody would have
    to be Mark Grace, and it didn't help that he won a world championship shortly
    thereafter.  \r\n\r\nInstant replay needs to be injected (which is kind of an
    unfortunate word to have to use) into baseball culture.  Think of how silly this
    is:  The only guy on the field that needed to see the Jumbotron wasn't allowed
    to look at it in review.  That's ridiculous.\r\n\r\n\"Dude, shut your hole\" -
    Andrew Round\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the current state of the 2010 Cubs and the choices management faces.  Whisperings of interest from the Angels in Derrek Lee is forcing us to consider the idea of the Cubs losing players we have grown to love.  Kurt gives us a little review of the new ballpark in Minneapolis and we look at the idea of instant replay in baseball with the Question of the Week.  </p>
