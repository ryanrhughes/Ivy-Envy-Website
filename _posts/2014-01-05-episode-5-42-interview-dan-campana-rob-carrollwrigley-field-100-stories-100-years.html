<p>We have an interview episode for you this week.  This episode is pre-recorded because I am currently in Las Vegas at New Media Expo for the 9th Annual Podcast Awards.  Thanks to all of our dedicated listeners, we are a finalist in the Sports category.  You can follow this Cubs fan's shenanigans in Las Vegas by liking us on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or following <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/twitter" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>This is the first episode of 2014 and we thought it would be appropriate to talk about Wrigley Field, since the ballpark turns 100 years old in 2014.  Dan Campana and Rob Carroll are the co-authors of the new book, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wrigleybook" target="_blank">Wrigley Field: 100 Stories for 100 Years</a>.  In this conversation, we talk about this ballpark that we love so much.  We talk about what makes the ballpark special to not just Cubs fans, but all baseball fans.  </p>
