<p>As we inch closer and closer to the day that catchers and pitchers report to Spring Training (32 days), it appears that Jim Hendry is starting to gear the Cubs up for the 2011 season.&nbsp; Hendry made a move that didn't sound like it would happen until close to the trade deadline.&nbsp; He brought in Matt Garza (with Fernando Perez and Zach Rosscup) in exchange for 4 of the top 12 prospects in the Cubs minor league system...plus Sam Fuld.&nbsp; We have talked about this move <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3547" target="_blank">on the podcast</a> and Tim <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3552" target="_blank">posted about it</a>, so I don't feel the need to say anything else about it.</p>
<p>Hendry made another move yesterday and signed former fan favorite Reed Johnson.&nbsp; I'm sure you all remember where you were that spring evening in 2008 when Reed dove into a fence in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>I was in a pink 1991 Ford Econoline van driving to Macomb, IL to play a show with the band that I was playing with at that time.&nbsp; Everyone in the van was a Cubs fan and we spent about half of the drive trying to figure out exactly what happened on the play.&nbsp; We were having some difficulty picturing the play based on the description made by the play-by-play broadcaster of the moment, Cory Provus.&nbsp; I like Cory, now Bob Uecker's partner on Brewers radio, but he came nowhere near describing this play in the detail that Pat Hughes would have provided.&nbsp; Needless to say, all we could gather from Ron's (Rest in Peace) explanation was that the play was exciting to an observer.</p>
<p>It was that play that made most Cubs fans fall in love with the little man with high socks and bad facial hair that was cut by the Blue Jays.&nbsp; Cubs Convention is this weekend, and the annual event that usually sells out in a very short period of time still has tickets available, months after they were initially released.&nbsp; The economy could be to blame.&nbsp; So could a 5th place finish in the division in 2010. Either way, there is a lack of interest in the casual fan.</p>
<p>I don't believe Jim Hendry pulled off this move to sell the remaining tickets to Cubs Convention.&nbsp; But at the same time, I doubt there were many other teams knocking down Reed Johnson's door this week.&nbsp; The move probably could have waited until next week.&nbsp; Hendry faces some tough questions, as always, at the convention this year.&nbsp; Bringing back a few fan favorites in Kerry Wood and Reed Johnson does appeal to a lot of romantic Cubs fans and surely doesn't hurt ticket sales.&nbsp; I'm not sure it will remove most of the hostility many Cubs fans have for Hendry (deserved and undeserved), though.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kerry Wood, there have been rumors flying around the last few days that Kerry Wood had a future broadcast job with the Cubs worked into his contract when he came back to the Cubs.&nbsp; It was initially reported on the Score 670am.&nbsp; Both the Cubs and Wood <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-12/sports/ct-spt-0113-around-town--20110112_1_rumors-cubs-broadcast-booth" target="_blank">poo-poo'd the notion</a>, but some folks <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/league-of-her-own/2011/01/thursday-headlines-ten-bucks-says-wood-will-end-up-in-the-booth.html" target="_blank">stand by the their sources</a>.</p>
