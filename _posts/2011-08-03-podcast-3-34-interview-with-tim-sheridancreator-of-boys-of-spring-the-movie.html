<p>When Kurt and I were at Spring Training in March, we met with Tim Sheridan, the public address announcer for the Cubs Spring Training games at Hohokam Stadium.  Tim also runs <a href="http://www.boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>, a fantastic website for Spring Training reports and resources, as well as a place for year-round analysis of the Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>In this episode, we welcome Tim back on the Podcast to talk about a project he's been working on for nearly 30 years, <strong><u>Boys of Spring - The Movie</u></strong>.  This film will be unlike any Cubs documentary you've seen before.  Tim has been carrying around a camera for all of his years as the public address announcer at Hohokam and has captured some incredible Cubs moments over the years.  Take a look at the trailer for the film:</p>
