We focus on the pitching and the young prospects in our conversation. WGN Radio is looking for a new song for their Cubs game broadcasts. We play the three finalists and if you have a burning desire to give you support to one of the songs, you can vote for Look Out Love, Bill Baum &amp; Andi Fredrickson or Modern Day Romeos, you can <a href="http://wgnradio.com/2014/03/05/wgn-radio-cubs-song-contest/" target="_blank">vote here</a>.</p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions. We ask for these on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, typically on Sunday mornings. We read some Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's caption contest.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to Voices4Peru, <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fill-chairs-4-education?c=pledges" target="_blank">here is their IndieGogo page</a>.</p>
<p>We will be hosting an online open house on our website this Saturday (March 15th) during the Cubs/Mets WGN televised game. Our re-designed website will have a new logo, new features and many improvements and upgrades. Come by IvyEnvy.com on Saturday between 2:30pm and 4:30pm Central and check out the new site and hang out in the chat and talk Cubs baseball during the game.</p>
