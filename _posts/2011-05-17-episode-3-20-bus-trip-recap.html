  content: "I intended to listen to the podcast while I did other things but I ended
    up just sitting and listening to the whole thing and typing comments.  Here they
    are....\r\nThe trivia was cool.  I'd say it was about the right difficulty.....Kurt,
    the pizza place you've never heard of was Ian's..... I DVR'd the game and wider
    shots didn't look as bad on TV but close-ups revealed it as it really was.....I
    noticed during the broadcast the home plate ump is not wearing gloves.  I had
    my hands out for about five minutes taking some pictures and they were froze.
    \ I don't know how he lasted without gloves..... Speaking of photos, I have an
    arm's length portrait of my wife and I.  In the background you can see Corey and
    Andy sharing a blanket....No doubt concentrating on the game was tough.  The thing
    I remember is that Barney and Castro got on base every time but the rest of the
    offense did nothing....I didn't really get to see Doug Davis pitch.  Unless you
    pay big bucks for tickets or sit in the bleachers at Wrigley you always have a
    pole blocking something.  The pole blocked the pitchers mound for me.... Until
    next time. Go Cubs."

<p>First off, the audio in this episode is bad and I apologize.  I didn't realize until we had recorded for an hour that the audio was being recording through the built-in speaker on the laptop, not the mics/mixer.  I made this mistake once in Arizona and now I've made it again...I've learned my lesson.</p>
<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt describe the Ivy Envy Bus Trip to the Cubs/Giants game on Saturday.  If you were there or saw it on TV, you probably know what our experience was.  We also discuss Randy Wells' potential return and the bad news from Mesa about Andrew Cashner.  We also talk about the Cubs' options with Tyler Colvin.  We also choose a winner for the Ryan Theriot photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>We also give a little air-time for local band/Cubs fans/Ivy Envy fans <u><strong>The Lion in Rome</strong></u> and play a song off their new demo at the end of the show.  </p>
