  content: I watched the game... Zambrano was pretty fun to watch.  They had this
    camera angle behind the plate that really showed the break on his pitches, and
    they looked sick or filthy or whatever (in the parlance of our times).

<p>I was unable to watch Zambrano's gem in San Francisco last night because I'm camping.&nbsp; Yet, I can take the time to comment on it...ah, technology and a wise camping location.</p>
<p>But last night is exactly why Zambrano needs to be kept with the Cubs.&nbsp; He has proven that he can be an elite pitcher and it's quite valuable to a team that can't manufacture offense to have a pitcher that has a career batting average of .235 and has the power to poke one over the fence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not ignoring the fact that Zambrano can be a head-case.&nbsp; But if we as Cubs fans can think that we can ditch Bradley and Zambrano and never have to worry about nut-case players and grown men that need to be pampered, we are wrong.&nbsp; This is what professional sports is and it's only going to get worse.&nbsp; We can lose a ton of money and let Bradley go, that's fine.&nbsp; But I think ditching Zambrano would be a great mistake.</p>
