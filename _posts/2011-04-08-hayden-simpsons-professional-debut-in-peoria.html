<p>Since being drafted by the Cubs in the 1st Round in 2010, Hayden Simpson took the mound for the first time Thursday night.  Simpson suffered a bout of mononucleosis and was unable to play in the 2010 season.  On a breezy and damp night in Peoria, Simpson made his professional debut against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim's Midwest League affiliate, the Cedar Rapids Kernals, on Opening Night for the Chiefs at O'Brien Field.</p>
<p>Simpson was not the only player on the Chiefs to play the first game of his professional career.  Rubi Silva, a 19 year old Cuban native, signed with the Cubs in December and played right field for the Chiefs.  The other new players to the Chiefs this year are:  Sergio Burruel, Arismendy Alcantara, Micah Gibbs and Cam Greathouse.</p>
<p><strong>1st Inning</strong><br />
Hayden Simpson gave up a bunt single to the first batter he faced.  Greg Rohan was positioned a few steps off the grass at 3rd and the Kernals' Drew Heid was able to beat out Rohan's bare-handed throw to first.  Heid then stole 2nd, but was unable to advance as Simpson registered two strikeouts and got Brandon Decker to fly-out to left field.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Inning</strong><br />
The Kernals' right-fielder, Ryan Jones, hit a one-out single and then stole 2nd base.  Simpson then walked David Harris, who was forced out at 2nd on a 6-3 double play, ending the inning.</p>
<p><strong>3rd Inning</strong><br />
Simpson looked dominant in the 3rd, striking out the side.  He worked fast, perhaps noticing the dark clouds building and trying to pick up the pace of the game to ensure the game became official.</p>
<p><strong>4th Inning</strong><br />
After striking out his 4th batter in a row, Simpson gave up a homerun to Brandon Decker that landed on the left-field pavilion.  He recovered by striking out the next batter, Carlos Ramirez.  After a trip to the mound by Chiefs pitching coach,  Jeff Fassero, and then an infield huddle, Simpson was pulled from the game and replaced by Yohan Gonzalez.</p>
<p><strong>Summary on Simpson</strong><br />
Hayden Simpson went 3 2/3 IP, giving up 1 run on 3 hits.  He walked 1 and struck out 7 in the no-decision.  Simpson threw 67 pitches, 43 of which were strikes.  Overall, Simpson looked sharp and comfortable.  His fast ball was at about 88mph, according to the radar gun at O'Brien Field.  </p>
<p>The Chiefs have a piggy-back system with their starting pitching and the games are split between two starters.  Eric Yokish took over on the mound for the Chiefs in the 5th inning.  Yokish was prepared for the cold, wet and breezy April conditions as he was essentially playing in his backyard.  Yokish is a Virginia, IL native, growing up about 70 miles from Peoria.</p>
<p><strong>Game Summary</strong><br />
The Chiefs got off to a hot start in the first inning.  Matt Sczcur led the inning off with a solid hit down the right-field line, but was thrown out, trying to stretch it into a triple.  Rubi Silva drew a walk in his first professional at-bat and showed quite a bit of speed by scoring from 1st base on Greg Rohan's double.  Rohan got things started in the 8th with a lead-off double.  After a strikeout by Richard Jones, Rohan advanced to 3rd on a wild pitch by Kernals reliever, AJ Schugel.  Rohan then trotted home on a triple by DJ Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>That's when the rain began to fall pretty heavily and the Kernals slowed the game down perhaps trying to keep this game tied, heading into a rain delay.  The rain delay did come, but not before Kernals reliever Donn Roach got Anthony Giasanti to ground-out to the shortstop, to end the 8th inning.  </p>
<p>Rohan had the best offensive performance for the Chiefs.  He went 2-4 with two doubles, an RBI and a run scored.  Anthony Giasanti also went 2-4 with a single and a double.  About an hour into the rain delay, the game suspended and will be resumed at 5pm on Friday with the score 2-2 in the top of the 9th.  After the conclusion of this game, the regularly scheduled Friday evening game will start at 6:30pm.</p>
