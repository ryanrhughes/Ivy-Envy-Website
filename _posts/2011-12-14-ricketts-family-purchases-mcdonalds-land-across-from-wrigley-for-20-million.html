  content: "Family-friendly attractions? I thought the Ricketts family bought that
    McDonald's restaurant as an added enticement to lure Prince Fielder to the Cubs:\r\n\r\n\"Sign
    with us, Prince, and we'll give you your very own fast-food franchise.\"\r\n\r\nBut
    seriously, I agree with your point that Wrigleyville is in need of something family-friendly
    outside the stadium. The Cubs might as well be the ones to own it, because they're
    the ones who will benefit the most from it."

<p>When I had the opportunity to attend the Tom Ricketts luncheon and press conference in Peoria last year, he spoke extensively on the fan experience in Wrigley Field and the surrounding area.  This kind of talk makes a lot of Cubs fans nervous.  Whether we want to admit it or not, we are traditionalists.  Wrigley Field, and the neighborhood, have an aura about them, and change is scary to those entrenched in tradition. </p>
<p>The Ricketts made a big step in the transformation of the neighborhood this week by purchasing the acre of land where McDonald&rsquo;s and the parking lot sit, on Clark Street, across from Wrigley. </p>
<p>In that press conference in Peoria, Ricketts discussed the fact that he and the Cubs would like to improve the family-friendly aspect of Wrigleyville.  Five years ago, I would have poo-poo&rsquo;d the idea and ranted about inflatable bouncy-houses and claimed they were trying to turn the area in a Cubs version of Disneyland.  But now that I have kids, I completely understand the needs that Ricketts identified. </p>
<p>I have two pre-school aged daughters and I have not taken them to a Cubs game yet.  If we didn&rsquo;t live 180 miles from Wrigley, I probably would have by now.  I do plan to take my oldest to a Cubs game next year, and something I&rsquo;ve already considered is, &ldquo;What am I going to do before and after the game with her?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Given my distance from Wrigley, I&rsquo;m not completely familiar with the area to know the ins and outs of every business, but near as I can tell, in the immediately surrounding area, I&rsquo;m pretty much limited to Taco Bell and McDonald&rsquo;s unless I want to be the guy stopping in a bar with his 5 year old to drink an Old Style before the game. </p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m with my friends, I want to enjoy the establishments that Wrigleyville has to offer.  But &ldquo;family&rdquo; is a huge part of the game of baseball.  I want to pass on my love for the game to my daughters and what better way to do it than to take them to Wrigley Field for their first game. </p>
<p>While no details have come out about what the Ricketts intend to do with this land, I can guarantee there will be some family-friendly attractions.  For my daughters&rsquo; sakes, I look forward to there being a place for them to go before the game that will enhance their experience.  For my sake, I look forward to not having to take them into the Taco Bell bathroom.   </p>
