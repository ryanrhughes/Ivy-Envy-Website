  content: Andy.. it was a tough choice for me.. It's hard for a guy named Tim to
    not take a guy named Tim Timmons.. but I decided to go with Hunter Wendelstedt.  Aside
    from his high number of ejections early in the year (3), the dude's got a great
    name.

  content: Manstrength.  Your comment completely baffles me.  Andy?  Names?  This
    post was about Jacque Jones, sir.

<p>I decided to flip over to ESPN tonight to watch a little of the Angels game.&nbsp; The first play I see is a base hit to left field by the Angels.&nbsp; They had a runner on 2nd base and good old Jacque Jones grabs the ball on the run for a play at the plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-44"></a>He throws the ball from shallow left field and he throws it straight into the ground.&nbsp; The shortstop is playing near the edge of the dirt.&nbsp; This ball traveled about 30 feet and bounced three times.&nbsp; Now, whether he was trying to hit the cut-off guy or throw it home, nobody will ever know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't count how many times I saw this happen when Jones wore Cubbie Blue.&nbsp; His throws to the plate barely made the infield or they cleared homeplate by 20 feet and bounced off the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked Jacque Jones and thought he got a bad rap from the Chicago media, especially WSCR 670AM.&nbsp; I got real tired of hearing Murph call him "Jacque Strap".&nbsp; He played a large role in the Cubs making the playoffs last year.&nbsp; He had a great August and September.</p>
<p>However, when Jacque gears up to throw home, who knows where that ball will initially hit the ground or where it will end up.</p>
