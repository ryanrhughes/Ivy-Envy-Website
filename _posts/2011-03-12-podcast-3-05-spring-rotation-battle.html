<p>Spring Training continues and we look at the battle for the open spots in the rotation.  We also talk about some of the young players that will spend 2011 in the minor league system, but are getting some playing time this Spring.  Dispatch/Argus sports-writer Matt Veto sits down for a segment with us and we pick a winner for our weekly photo caption contest.  </p>
