<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey for another in our series of awkward Skype episodes.  The Cubs gave us plenty to talk about in this episode.  Zambrano was dealt to the Marlins for Chris Volstad.  We reflect on the Zambrano era and consider how we will remember his years with the Cubs.  With the trade, the Miami Marlins have become even more of a powder-keg that should be interesting to keep an eye on.  Volstad appears to be exactly what the Cubs are looking for...young, cheap and under club control.  </p>
<p>We don't comment much on the Starlin Castro situation and tell you why.  </p>
<p>Andrew Cashner was traded to the Padres for Anthony Rizzo, who is potentially the Cubs' first baseman of the future.  Given the expectations that were put on Cashner, who has not completely failed them yet, it makes for an interesting trade which, in the long run, will probably result in fans putting more, or less, faith in Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer.  </p>
<p>While losing two potential starting pitchers this week in Zambrano and Cashner, the Cubs gained one in Paul Maholm.  You can't bring up Maholm without discussing his lack of run support and horrible W-L record, yet low ERA.  </p>
<p>As usual, we finish the episode off with choosing a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
