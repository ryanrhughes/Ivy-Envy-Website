<p>Andy and Corey talk about the new Epstein regime, as Jed Hoyer and Jason McLeod are brought into the fold.  We talk about the Epstein press conference and what stood out to us.  We continue our praise of Tom Ricketts and his dedication to doing everything he can to help the Cubs build a winning organization. </p>
<p>We look at the Hendry years and predict how things will differ between the previous and present front offices.  Then, we take a look at some specific players and situations and predict what Epstein and Hoyer will do.  </p>
