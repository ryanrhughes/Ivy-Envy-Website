  content: Answering my own question, I like that players still use wood bats. The
    reasons aren't nostalgia and it would hardly be fair (or safe) to let Soriano
    use a metal bat, but given the technological advances in every aspect of our lives
    its nice to see the players still swinging lumber. Dangerously explosive lumber.

  content: "Awww... Kurt, you are my guy.\r\n\r\nI'm catching up on some reading here.
    In fact, Brenly said \"Root, root, root for the Cubbies,\" to which I overheard
    a call on the staff radios from the Bandits GM, saying, \"Who just let that happen?\"\r\n\r\nHilarious!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the love fest."

<p>Bob Brenly made a trip to the Quad Cities. I'm sure Paul is heartbroken that he missed him. It's not huge news, but it did <a title="Brenly QC visit" href="http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=435542&amp;query=veto" target="_blank">make the paper</a> thanks to our good friend Matt Veto. With the Cubs on FOX and a rare weekend day off, Brenly took in the Peoria Chiefs v. QC River Bandits game Saturday night to see his son and&nbsp;<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=574" target="_self">Cubs prospect</a>&nbsp;Michael and was coaxed into singing "Take me out to the ball game". Let's hope he said "root for the Cubbies/Chiefs". Veto, what's the word?</p>
<p>I got that scoop from Matt last night when I ran in to him at a lecture at Augustana College. The lecture was titled<a title="Augustana lecture" href="http://www.augustana.edu/x12612.xml" target="_blank"> "The Changing World of&nbsp;Professional Baseball: How does America's pastime reflect American Culture?"</a>&nbsp;from University of San Fransisco&nbsp;anthropology professor&nbsp;George Gmelch, who played in the Tigers minor leagues system in the 1960s. Continuing the Veto lovefest, here's <a title="Veto article" href="http://qconline.com/archives/qco/display.php?id=435847&amp;query=veto" target="_blank">his write-up</a> on the lecture.</p>
<p>As a Cubs fan I'm overly nostalgic so hearing an "old-timer" talk about the game and its changes over the last thirty years was more than interesting. His account of 1960s minor league baseball seemed to show a near military relationship between coaches, front office staff and their young players. Uniforms were all worn the same way and routine curfew and bed checks were the norm. Things were done as a team and "individualism" was not as rampant. When asked "What has remained the same?", Gmelch was a little stumped, but added that the game itself (the rules) has changed very little while the players and the business have changed&nbsp;immensely.</p>
<p>For the sake of further discussion, what things have changed about the game that you don't like? Things you do like?</p>
