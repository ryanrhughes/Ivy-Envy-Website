Just like El Guapo had a plethora of pi&ntilde;atas, the Cubs had a plethora of prospects playing in various All-Star Games over the past few days.&nbsp; A few of us took in the Midwest League All-Star Game here at Modern Woodmen Park in the Quad Cities, so I'll start with an update on how the Peoria Chiefs players performed in the game.&nbsp; Corey wanted to write about their exploits, but he was too busy watching David "No Way!" Burlet the whole time to know what happened in the game.</p>

<p>Corey particularly enjoyed Burlet's theatrical skipping.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the <strong>Peoria Chiefs</strong> had two players start the game--<strong>Greg Rohan</strong> (Ro-hahn, Ro-hann, or Ro-hun?) at third and <strong>Matt Szczur</strong> in right.&nbsp;  Neither of these guys were able to do anything at the plate, but several Chiefs players were effective coming off the bench.&nbsp; <strong>Austin Kirk</strong> went untouched in his 0.2 inning pitched.&nbsp; <strong>Eliot Soto</strong> fielded his position at short quite well, despite his Campana-esque stature, and he drove in two runs with a single in the eighth.&nbsp; <strong>Micah Gibbs</strong> also singled and scored in the game.&nbsp; The Chiefs' West Division Team ended up winning 8-3.</p>
<p>We had a great time at the game, and you should come to a game at Modern Woodmen Park if you live anywhere near the Quad Cities.</p>
<p>The <strong>Daytona Cubs</strong> had six players representing them in the FSL All-Star Game.&nbsp; <strong>Justin Bour</strong> (DH) went 1-4 with a double, but <strong>Evan Crawford</strong> (CF) had a rough night at the plate, with five LOB.&nbsp; It appears that <strong>Junior Lake</strong> didn't get into the action, I believe since he had been called up to Tennessee.&nbsp; <strong>Michael Brenly</strong> had a big game, collecting two hits and an RBI.&nbsp; Daytona's pitchers didn't fare too well--<strong>Aaron Kurcz</strong> gave up three hits, and one of them was a home run.&nbsp; He was charged with two earned runs in his one inning of work.&nbsp; <strong>Frank Batista</strong> also struggled a bit, giving up two hits and one earned run.&nbsp; Even though Daytona's pitching gave up all three runs scored by the South, the North All-Stars won 5-3.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tennessee Smokies</strong> had a boatload of players in Southern League's All-Star Game.&nbsp; They had a team-record twelve players selected--Steve Clevenger, Ryan Flaherty, Marwin Gonzalez, Brett Jackson, Blake Lalli, DJ LeMahieu, Rebel Ridling, Matt Spencer, Marco Carillo, Rafael Dolis, Trey McNutt, and Rob Whitenack.&nbsp; Not all of these players appeared in the game due to injuries and call-ups, but that is an amazing number of players to be selected.&nbsp; In the game, <strong>Blake Lalli</strong> hit an RBI double, and <strong>Matt Spencer</strong> also collected a hit.&nbsp; <strong>Steve Clevenger</strong> was hit by a pitch and would later score.&nbsp; <strong>Rafael Dolis</strong> only faced two batters but did not give up a hit.&nbsp; The North Division won, 6-3.</p>
<p>The Pacific Coast League All-Star Game doesn't take place until July.</p>
<p>Corey and I were discussing one aspect of the Cubs farm system that is very encouraging, and that is the play of the catchers.&nbsp; Corey mentioned that <strong>Wellington Castillo</strong> has been playing unbelievably well at Iowa--he earned player of the week honors by batting .625 with 12 RBI over four games.&nbsp; Gibbs, Brenly, and Clevenger have represented their teams well this season and all seem to be promising players.&nbsp; I'm a big Geovany Soto fan, but it's nice to know that the Cubs will have plenty of options if he can't produce as expected at the plate.</p>
