<p>The off-season starts out a little more eventful than we expected with the reported hiring of Theo Epstein as General Manager.  Andy, Corey and Jeremy discuss why this is a win for the Ricketts family and try to address some of the concerns people might have over this hiring.  </p>
<p>We also read some of our listeners' reactions to the hiring.  </p>
