<p>Andy, Corey, Jeremy and Ryan talk about the Cubs' first real losing streak under Mike Quade.  Corey talks about the Iowa Cubs game he attended in Omaha on Saturday.  We also speculate what could be leading to Ryan Dempster's struggles.  Should Starlin Castro be removed from shortstop?  Is Carlos Pena this bad?  In his absence, we give you <u>Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week</u> and we read your photo caption contest entries.  All of this and more on this episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  </p>
