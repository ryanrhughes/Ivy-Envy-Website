  content: "I don't think MIles will be with the Cubs much longer.\r\nI think Hendry
    is going to have to make some bigger moves to salvage this season and attempt
    to prepare it for a possible post-season run.  You bring up a good point, the
    team isn't horrible, but they would not fare well in the post season.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Soriano, I'd bat him 6th.  The purpose of a leadoff man is to \"get on and
    get over\".  Then, when your big bats come in, they can \"get 'em in\"."

  content: Soriano did end up batting 6th today (your clairvoyance is impressive).  The
    bad news is the Cubs got stomped.

<p>We are above .500 and are only two games behind the first-place Cardinals.&nbsp; Fans can still be optimistic about how the team will do within this division, but it has become increasingly difficult to hope for much success beyond that.&nbsp; This series against the Brewers and the upcoming series against the Cardinals will help make the final destination of this team clearer.</p>
<p>Sam Fuld has shown us in his two starts what damage the Cubs can do when their leadoff man gets on base.&nbsp; Fuld was on base for both of Lee's homers in Thursday's game, but Soriano probably wouldn't have been.&nbsp; In today's game, Soriano went 0-5, leaving 3 men on base.&nbsp; That performance doesn't effect success, and it seems that Lou is finally going to move him down in the lineup.&nbsp; It is nice to see Lee finally hitting something other than solo-shots, and it all begins with the leadoff man finding a way to get on base.</p>
<p>Also, not lost on us was the incredible defensive game the Cubs had on Thursday.&nbsp; Fuld led the way defensively, but Soto, Fukudome, and Blanco all made plays of the top 10 variety.&nbsp; If you didn't see this game, you owe it to yourself to check out the highlights <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?content_id=5356503&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; What the highlight video doesn't show on Fuld's put-out at the plate is that he hurls his entire body into that throw and flips over himself.&nbsp; Oh, and Lou was ejected in this game as well.&nbsp; Overall, the Cubs have been highly entertaining to watch lately.</p>
<p>Which player will the Cubs send down once Ramirez gets back next week?&nbsp; This is the tough decision the Cubs face.&nbsp; It will probably be Fuld or Blanco I expect.&nbsp; I wish the Cubs would turn Miles loose.</p>
