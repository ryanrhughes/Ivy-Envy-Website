<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Ryan talk about Jim Hendry's lack of movement at the trading deadline. We reminisce about Fukudome since he was the only move Hendry made.  We also talk about our evening at Modern Woodmen Park and the Peoria Chiefs' tendency to blow games.   </p>
<p>We also discuss the Matt Holliday/Starlin Castro situation and whether or not the Cubs should retaliate against the Cardinals.  </p>
<p>Old Style ends it's 61-year relationship with the Cubs.  This gives Kurt the opportunity to vent about cheap American beer.  Andy planned to treat us to some Hamm's (our choice to be Old Style's replacement), but the grocery store was out and he had to settle for the Coors Light Cold/Super Cold Silver Bullets.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for the photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>Be on the look out for two interviews this week. The first will be with Craig Wieczorkiewicz, the man known as The Midwest League Traveler.  The second will be with Tim Sheridan, the PA announcer for the Cubs Spring Training games at Hohokam Park in Mesa, Arizona.  </p>
