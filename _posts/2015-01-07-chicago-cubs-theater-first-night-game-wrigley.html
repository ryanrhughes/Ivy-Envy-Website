<em>Cubs Pitcher Al Nipper waits out the rain on August 8, 1988. (Sun-Times Photo)</em></p>
<p><em>We've moved past the most exciting part of the post-season - the Hot Stove, the Winter Meetings - and now we've settled in for a wait. We're still about six weeks out from pitchers and catchers reporting (<a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/chi-cubs-pitchers-catchers-report--feb-19th-20150105-story.html">February 19!</a>) and it's not quite time to start delving into fantasy baseball projections. So, during this seemingly interminable wait, maybe it's best to enjoy some sights and sounds from Cubs' games past (well, some of them, anyway). To hold us over until Spring Training, I'll be scouring the Internet for Cubs games to share and annotate and, really, just enjoy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Up first: 8-8-88, The First Night Game That Never Was</strong></p>

<p>The long-time battle to bring lights to Wrigley Field finally came to fruition on 8-8-88, a hot and humid August night on the North Side (there's no other kind, really). But the baseball gods threw a little wrinkle into the Cubs' plans: throughout the pre-game festivities and the early innings, you can see the sky growing darker not because of the setting sun but rather thanks to an approaching summer thunderstorm. And it was one big boomer, raining out the Phillies-Cubs game that should have gone down in to the history books. The next night, they tried it all again versus the Mets and this time got away with it, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN198808090.shtml">a 6-4 win over the Mets</a>. But it lacked the pomp and circumstance of the previous night's ceremonies: the TV reporters (and Steve Stone!) in tuxedos, Bill Murray slamming a Budweiser on camera with Harry, the Jack Brickhouse-led ceremony in which live-long Cubs fan Harry Grossman pressed the button to light the skies around Wrigley. The video cuts out pretty much the entire rain delay (over two hours), but comes back to include the <a href="http://youtu.be/gJDNpJmZ91w?t=50s">players sliding across the tarp</a>. </p>
<p>Somewhere, in the labyrinth of my parents' storage unit, there's a box that contains a video that holds both this and the next night's game that I taped off TV as a kid. Fortunately, though, YouTube has come to the rescue with full coverage - bad commercials and all - from that first night, that first attempt to play baseball under lights at Wrigley. Enjoy and find below the video an annotation of some of the bigger moments from the video for your viewing ease. If you want more archive fun for the game, <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/sports/inside-the-cubs/look-back-lights-at-wrigley-field/">here's a round-up of links to old stories, video, and photos</a> I prepared for the 25th anniversary in 2013 while I was at the Sun-Times.</p>
<p>(<strong>NOTE</strong>: This first game, the one that didn't count, was aired on hometown SuperStation WGN but, if memory serves, NBC actually aired the next night's game against the Mets as a Game of the Week (if I'm wrong, let me know). I wish I could double-check this with the old videotape. Alas. Anyway, the advantage is the run of great local commercials that air during the WGN game, including a few of the usual Cubs hawking local goods spots.)</p>
<p><strong>ANNOTATIONS</strong><br />
<strong>0:00:00 - 0:29:00</strong> - The pregame festivities, mostly anchored by some WGN reporters in tuxes, including a few live shots inside Harry's restaurant. Some good flashback stuff in here and general reflecting about WHAT IT ALL MEANS.<br />
<strong>0:06:30 - 0:10:00</strong> - The actual lighting ceremony, hosted by Jack Brickhouse and featuring Harry Grossman, as I mentioned above. The leading the fans in the "let there be light" chant is pretty great.<br />
<strong>0:29:25 - 0:47:00</strong> - The Leadoff Man begins and it features Steve Stone in a tuxedo so what more could you ask for?<br />
<strong>0:40:00</strong> - A back-to-back set of fun Cubs commercials: Andre Dawson hawking (GET IT???) cars and The Zim pitching a bank.<br />
<strong>0:52:40</strong> - The famous Bill Murray appearance in which Harry toasts Bill with a beer, they joke about Bill's mom, and Bill even gives promotion to an upcoming film he just completed called "Scrooged."<br />
<strong>0:57:55</strong> - First pitch from Rick Sutcliffe to the Phillies' Phil Bradley<br />
<strong>0:59:00</strong> - Bradley goes yard, a leadoff homer<br />
<strong>0:59:30</strong> - As Bradley celebrates in the dugout, you can hear Murray in the background of the booth screaming, "TURN THE LIGHTS OFF!"<br />
<strong>1:06:50</strong> - Morganna The Kissing Bandit going after Ryno! There's also a scrolling note of a severe thunderstorm watch for the Chicago area. Foreboding.<br />
<strong>1:08:15</strong> - RYNO GOES DEEP! A two-run shot to give the Cubs a 2-1 lead.<br />
<strong>1:16:00</strong> - Murray sticks around, calling the game with Steve and Harry.<br />
<strong>1:16:35</strong> - Video of Billy Williams and Ernie Banks throwing out the first pitch.<br />
<strong>1:22:12</strong> - Murray takes a great shot at Peter Uberoth over the 1984 NLCS.<br />
<strong>1:22:35</strong> - The (in)famous "I'm A Bud Man" commercial with Harry.<br />
<strong>1:25:15</strong> - OMINOUS CLOUDS<br />
<strong>1:26:10</strong> - An honest to god Bleacher Bum!<br />
<strong>1:33:15</strong> - Governor Thompson. Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha (Murray gets some great political joke cracks in, if you're into Chicago politics, particularly his joke about Richard J. Daley giving him a special voting pass.)<br />
<strong>1:42:23</strong> - Damn, that wind.<br />
<strong>1:46:49</strong> - Ah, when the rooftops were actually rooftops with residents and their friends hanging out and it didn't cost $100 to get up there.<br />
<strong>1:53:25</strong> - Stolen base for Ryno. Love Murray's continued heckling. I completely forgot about this, or just didn't pay attention as a child.<br />
<strong>1:58:45</strong> - Palmeiro drives in Ryno to give the Cubs a 3-1 lead only to get caught stealing less than 60 seconds letter.<br />
<strong>2:01:55</strong> - I forgot Harry used to duck over to the radio booth.<br />
<strong>2:03:40</strong> - BRICK. HOUSE.<br />
<strong>2:09:29</strong> - Just as the severe thunderstorm warning scrolls across the screen, there's a bit of thunder causing the crowd to "ooh" and "aah."<br />
<strong>2:10:28</strong> - Mark Harmon, promoting "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-DXaFDWof8">Stealing Home</a>." Wow.<br />
<strong>2:13:18</strong> - And we hit the rain delay - for a second. The video then jumps the 2 hour, 10 minute rain delay I mentioned above and wraps up with WGN's final moments of coverage.<br />
<strong>2:17:18</strong> - The sliding players! Zim was PISSED about this.<br />
<strong>2:19:10</strong> - This concludes our broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>NEXT TIME</strong>: A throwback classic with all sound, but no vision.</p>
