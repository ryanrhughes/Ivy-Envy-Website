<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey on Skype. &nbsp;This episode has a lot of off-topic conversation, as the Cubs had a pretty slow holiday week besides a small fire at Wrigley and shopping Matt Garza. &nbsp;We read some listener suggestion topics that include a realistic time table for the Cubs to be competitive, attendance at Wrigley in 2012, Cubs uniforms influenced by the Oregon Ducks, New Year's Resolutions and Ryan Braun's failed test.</p>
