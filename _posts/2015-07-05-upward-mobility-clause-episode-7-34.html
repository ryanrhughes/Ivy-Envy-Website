<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the slump the Cubs are in...you know the one where they've gone 5-1 in the last week.  Well, the record is a little misleading.  Tremendous starting and relief pitching have kept the Cubs moving forward while the offense continues to sputter.  </p>
<p>We talk about the last week in Cubs baseball, focusing on the series with the Marlins series.  </p>
<p>The Donn Roach era MIGHT be over as the Cubs add Clayton Richard.  It's hard to say what Richard's future with the Cubs is, but he performed well on Saturday night in the Cubs 7-1 win over the Marlins.  </p>
<p>We have a number of listener email to read and we discuss various topics that they bring up.  Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we read a handful of internet muscle flexes.</p>
