<p>Cubs vs. Cardinals.  I believe it&rsquo;s one of the best rivalries in baseball.  My feelings may be biased though, as I grew up in the heart of Cubs vs. Cardinals territory.  I draw the Mason-Dixon line of these two clubs at Galesburg, Illinois.  The Quad Cities Area is 45 minutes north of Galesburg and the area is, by far, covered in Cubby Blue.  I would say that Galesburg leans towards the Cubs, but I grew up 45 miles south of Galesburg and that is definitely Cardinals country.  I&rsquo;ve been related to (Uncle Tom &ndash; RIP) and surrounded by Cardinals fans my whole life.</p>
<p>My first Cubs game was August 8th, 1990 on a bus trip with my grandmother.  It was the two-year anniversary of the first night game at Wrigley.  It was a great day for me.  I got to see my Cubs take on the hated St. Louis Cardinals AND I got to wear my new white/neon green LA Gear shoes that were originally reserved for the first day of school, a few weeks later.  You remember those days and the anticipation of wearing new school clothes.  The game went 15 innings and after nearly 5 hours, the Cubs prevailed 4-3 on a two-strike, two-out RBI single by <strong>Hall-of-Famer</strong> Andre Dawson.</p>
<p>Strangely, even though I have lived and died with every Cubs game, I did not return to Wrigley Field until 2007.  I have seen the Cubs play more games on the road than I have seen at The Friendly Confines.  The games I have been to at Wrigley have not exactly been with teams I would consider to be rivals with the Cubs.  I have seen them play the Mariners, the Orioles and the Diamondbacks.  So I look forward to a game that the crowd actually cares about - a game with a fierce rival that impacts that division directly.  I really couldn&rsquo;t pick a better team than the Cardinals.</p>
<p>So this fierce rival that the crowd cares about brings me to the next topic.  Tomorrow, Andy and I will be in the bleachers at Wrigley.  I&rsquo;ve never sat in, or even been tempted to sit out in the bleachers.  I&rsquo;m pale and a red-head.  The sun and my skin don&rsquo;t mix well.  I take this seriously enough that in was on the phone for over an hour with a Dodgers ticket rep trying to find tickets for the July 11th game that would be in the shade.  Also, as discussed on the podcast, I&rsquo;m a scorecard nerd.  I try to keep the scorecard for every baseball game I go to.  I fill it out during the game and then the next day, cut out the article in the paper that summarizes the game and the box score and put it away in a box with the rest of my sporting event programs, ticket stubs and other pack-rat trash.  From what I know about the bleachers, I don&rsquo;t believe it will be easy for me to keep score.  I know it&rsquo;s pathetic and somewhat creepy.  But as I said in a podcast episode a few weeks ago, if I won the lottery, I would probably buy season tickets and become that overweight guy wearing sweatpants sitting on the edge of my seat with my scorecard and listening to the game on the radio.  It&rsquo;s just what I am, folks.  I dare to dream.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about the conduct of fans at Wrigley Field, specifically the fans in the bleachers.  I will consider this a fact-finding mission.  I&rsquo;ve heard of males urinating in empty beer cups from great distances.  We&rsquo;ve seen Shane Victorino showered with a beer.  I&rsquo;ve heard of the heckling that is thrown at outfielders.  That&rsquo;s not really my thing.  But I think spending an afternoon in the bleachers will give me an idea of how things really are out there.  I would assume I will see the bleachers at it&rsquo;s rowdiest.  It will be a warm and sunny day in late May and a game against the hated Cardinals, with players that are easy for Cubs fans to hate.  It will also be a mid-afternoon start-time, giving Cubs fans plenty of time to wet the whistles in the hot sun.</p>
<p>Andy and I will be <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">tweeting</a> and live-blogging to the site from the game.  We feel it&rsquo;s our duty&hellip;.or it gives us something to do while fans unlike ourselves hurl insults at players.</p>
