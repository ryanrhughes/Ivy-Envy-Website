  content: Definitely nice to see the hustle by Soto.  He has become quite a threat
    at the plate.  Ramirez did go 3-5 in this game with a homerun, so it is hard for
    me to look on him negatively.  However, you're right--it would be nice to see
    everyone flying out of the box like Soto did.

    RBI's Corey, RBI's.

    He is an RBI machine, with just one flaw; he enjoys watching the game.

<p>Geovany Soto "dashed" around the bases last night like only a catcher can.&nbsp; Almost 49 years after it last happened, a Cubs catcher hit an inside the park homerun.&nbsp; Soto is quickly helping me forget&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-80"></a>about Michael Barret and Andy forget about Jason Kendall.&nbsp; Both of whom should definitely be forgotten.&nbsp; Hopefully Soto will amount to more than another Cubs rookie that wore #18...Dwight Smith.</p>
<p>But as I watched Soto leg this one out, all I could think about was, "What if Ramirez hit that ball".&nbsp; I guarantee you that he wouldn't have started sprinting to ensure that the hit was a homerun one way or another.&nbsp; I am fairly certain that Ramirez would have ended up standing on first base...maybe second.&nbsp; Maybe Ramirez took note of Soto's action.&nbsp; I hope so.</p>
<p>And I hate to harp on this, but if I see Ramirez hit one more infield distance flyball, I'm going to scream.&nbsp; I would like to know how many of those he hits in one game.&nbsp; I bet he hits at least 2 or 3 a game that are either in the infield, in the infield foul territory, or the first five rows of the stands.</p>
<p>Hopefully this All-Star will learn from guys like Theriot, Fontenot, Fukudome and Soto.</p>
