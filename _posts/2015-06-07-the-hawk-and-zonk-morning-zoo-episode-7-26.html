  content: I listen to the home team feed on SiriusXM.  When I don't have a good internet
    connection,  I often listen to the broadcast of the team we're playing. I can
    tell you that I hate Mike Shannon  the most.

We saw a terrible outing by Carlos Pimentel and a spectacular #BaezBomb.  Then a different #BaezBomb dropped today and we talk about the incredibly poor timing of his injury. </p>
<p>Chris Denorfia is back from the DL and his first game back was a great one.  We talk about what the addition of Denorfia means for the bench depth for the Cubs, especially heading into a few series at American League ballparks.</p>
<p>We talk about Junior Lake's shushing of the Marlins dugout and share our thoughts on this type of behavior.  Derrick calls in with an anti-Castro rebuttal.  He raises a lot of good points and we meet in the middle on a few things.</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions.  Kurt gives his scary stat of the week and we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
