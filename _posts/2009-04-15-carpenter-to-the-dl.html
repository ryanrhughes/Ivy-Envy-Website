<p>Going in to four game series against the Birds on the Bat this can't be bad for the Cubs. <a title="Carpenter on DL" href="http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090415&amp;content_id=4280376&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl" target="_blank">MLB.com</a> is reporting Birds ace Chris Carpenter is going on the 15 day dl with a rib cage injury. He was injured in Tuesday's game vs. the D-backs. Carpenter still needs to prove he can stay healthy for a season, but it doesn't look promising. When he's healthy he's as good as there is in baseball. Sound familiar Cubs fans? After his nearly perfect first outing I'm sure Birds fans were getting pretty excited. Not too fast. This bird has fallen off the bat for at least 15 days.</p>
