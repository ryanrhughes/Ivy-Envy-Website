<p>Yes, like any fans of a professional sports team, there are annoying Cubs fans.&nbsp; But old Marty seems to be taking issue with all Cubs fans.&nbsp; Could it be that he's jealous that the Reds can't draw numbers anywhere near what the Cubs do?&nbsp; Is he jealous of the die-hard spirit of Cubs fans?&nbsp; Maybe he's bitter that the Reds are stuck with Dusty Baker for a while and that the Cubs unloaded him when they did.&nbsp; Or maybe he's mad at the whole Cubs organization.&nbsp; Thom, his son, was let go as an announcer after he was offered a position with Fox to do national weekend games.&nbsp; The Cubs and WGN&nbsp;didn't want to share an employee and so Thom left.</p>
<p>No matter the reason, Marty came off sounding like a loony old grumpy man.&nbsp; If you listen carefully, he sounds strikingly similar to Hawk Harrelson.&nbsp;</p>
