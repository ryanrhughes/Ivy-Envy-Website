<p>After four seasons of podcasting on the Cubs, we feel that we deserve to throw our hat in the ring for some podcast awards.  We'd love it if you would help us out by nominating our podcast with the <strong>2012 Stitcher Awards</strong> and <strong>The 8th Annual Podcast Awards</strong>  Below is a post we took from Relentless Podcast Network's website.  It tells you how to nominate us for these awards and there's a few suggestions on podcasts for nominate in other categories.  Thank you for your support.  </p>
<p><center><a href="http://relentlesspodcastnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/printres2.jpg"><img src="http://relentlesspodcastnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/printres2-300x283.jpg" alt="" title="printres2" width="300" height="283" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-305" /></a></center></p>
<p>The nomination periods for two different podcast awards are going on right now and RPN shows would love your votes.  </p>
<p><strong><u>The 2012 Stitcher Awards</strong></u><br />
The First Annual Stitcher Awards nomination process is underway and will end on October 19th.  By going to <a href="http://stitcher.promotw.com" target="_blank">http://stitcher.promotw.com</a>, you can nominate your favorite shows.  Our suggestions are to nominate the following shows in the these categories:</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com" target="_blank">Ivy Envy</a> for <u>Best Sports Commentary</u><br />
<a href="http://mommyscocktailhour.com" target="_blank">Mommy's Cocktail Hour</a> for <u>Best Health and Lifestyle</u>...because being a drunk mom is a lifestyle.<br />
<a href="http://patrickspath.com" target="_blank">Patrick's Path to Sustainable Farming</a> in <u>Best Business and Finance</u><br />
<a href="http://qcstep.com" target="_blank">QC STEP Podcast</a> in <u>Education and Learning</u></p>
<p>There are a few podcasts that aren't on RPN, but we'd like to show our support. Vote for these shows too!<br />
<a href="http://100wordspodcast.com" target="_blank">100 Words or Less</a> in <u>Best Music Commentary</u><br />

You can vote once a day with the Stitcher Awards, so go there every day until October 19th and vote for these podcasts.</p>
