<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+f_TacDLqnzYl.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/Mike+Olt+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+f_TacDLqnzYl-213x300.jpg" alt="Mike Olt" width="213" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9110" /></a>Lets flash back to last July. The Cubs traded Matt Garza to the Texas Rangers for prospects C.J. Edwards, Neil Ramirez, Justin Grimm, and an interesting piece, Mike Olt. Olt played 16 games with the Rangers in 2012 and was considered the one of the top prospects in, not just the Rangers' organization, but in the entire Major Leagues.</p>
<p>When Olt got to Iowa last summer, he struggled. Well, struggled might be a good way of putting it. He hit .168 with an OPS of .551 in 39 games with the AAA affiliate, while just hitting three home runs in 152 plate appearances. Most of those troubles can be attributed to an eye issue that occurred when he was playing winter ball after the 2012 season.</p>
<p>Those eye issues have been worked out, and Olt is ready to make an impact on the 2014 Cubs. In Spring Training, he has hit .273 with a .963 OPS and five home runs in 49 plate appearances over 15 games. Most of those games have come while being the DH in the lineup due to a sore shoulder permitting him to play third. Olt has finally reached the level of playing third in games this past week. In his first game at third, Olt made two errors in the field (one throwing and one fielding), but part of that can be attributed to rust as he hasn't played in live game action all spring.</p>
<p>Olt's chances to make the big league roster are very high. His bat is more than capable to provide a ton of offense at third. He has been thought as a plus defender at third, so the real issue was if his eye injury was still there. The way he has hit this spring, there should be no reason he's not in the Cubs opening day lineup at third, and possibly batting cleanup behind Anthony Rizzo.</p>
<p>It doesn't make sense, in my opinion, to send Olt down to AAA. Christian Villanueva is already down in minor league camp and ready to take the AAA third base spot. Plus, Olt will give the Cubs' fans a sense of "The Future" plan. With a young player like Olt coming up and performing at the big league level, that can give the Cubs a start to the rebuilding process that has taken place since Theo and company took over baseball operations.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Mike Olt becomes the hitter that he was before the eye problem and takes over the Cubs' third base reigns for the foreseeable future and can be contributing for the team that has all the studs up in 2015 and 2016.</p>
