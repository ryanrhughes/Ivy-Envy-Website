  content: I was listening to David Kaplan last night. He says Lou has lost his fire
    (but not responsible for the Cubs' suckage), Milton Bradley was a horrible mistake
    and Soriano was the single worst signing in the history of baseball from a performance
    standpoint. His words were harsh.

  content: Great numbers--Figgins seems like just the type of player the Cubs are
    sorely lacking.  However, and talk to Chone just takes me back to Corey's bachelor
    party.

  content: I was wondering if you were going to bring that up.  I didn't mention it,
    to leave the door open for you.

    Is it time to look ahead to 2010? - Ivy Envy

<p>With a month left of the 2009 season, I'm ready to put it to bed.&nbsp; I realized during <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1380">this week's podcast</a> that there isn't really much to talk about and there's still 27 games to play.&nbsp; What more is there to say?&nbsp; At this point, all conversation about 2009 dies and speculation of what will happen or what needs to happen for 2010 takes over.&nbsp; But it feels inappropriate to talk about next year when there is still a month of baseball left.&nbsp; I'll do it anyway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/chi-07-cubs-bits-chicago-sep07,0,695893.story">I read that Chone Figgins</a> might be a good fit for the Cubs.&nbsp; It's not a secret that the Cubs are lacking a lead-off hitter and overall speed.&nbsp; Figgins would also be the solution for the Cubs at 2nd base.&nbsp; The Angels have used him at 3rd base most of the time, but he has played all over the field.&nbsp; Sound like a former second baseman we lost in this last offseason?</p>
<p>Chone is having a great season and was an All-Star this year for the first time in his career.&nbsp; But as we learned with Milton Bradley, it's not fair to judge a player based on their one career year and then expect them to meet or exceed that production.&nbsp; So let's ignore his stats this year and just focus on his career average.&nbsp; These stats are based on 162 games.</p>
<p>BA: .292</p>
<p>OBP: .363</p>
<p>HR:&nbsp; 5</p>
<p>RBI:&nbsp; 59</p>
<p>SB:&nbsp; 49</p>
<p>CS: 17</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="figgins" src="http://www.alivenotdead.com/attachments/2008/04/40600_200804011100471.thumb.jpg" alt="" width="275" height="235" /></p>
<p>This year, his OBP is .400 and it's the second season in which he's flirted with .400.&nbsp; He has a stolen base success rate of around 75%.&nbsp; I think 2nd base and the lead-off spot are two fairly big issues that the Cubs need to address in the upcoming off-season.&nbsp; In the article about this potential move, Piniella points out that the Cubs are last in stolen bases.&nbsp; This is a very slow team, top to bottom.&nbsp; Soriano was signed as a speedster, but he's been reduced to a steady trot.&nbsp; The leader for the team in stolen bases this year is Ryan Theriot, with 16.&nbsp; Theriot is not fast and it seems like he really has to pick his pitches to steal.&nbsp; As of today, Figgins has 39 steals for the season.</p>
<p>I don't think Figgins would solve all of the problems that this team has, but it would be an improvement in the leadoff spot.&nbsp; This team does not have a leadoff hitter and Piniella indicates that if the Cubs don't find one in the off-season, Fukudome will be the lead-off man.&nbsp; Though I feel that Fukudome filled the role fairly well, he wasn't able to do what a natural leadoff hitter does.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would welcome Figgins with open arms, even if Baseball-Reference.com tells me that the the most similar hitter to him is Bip Roberts, the man whose baseball card you got in every pack you bought in 1989.</p>
