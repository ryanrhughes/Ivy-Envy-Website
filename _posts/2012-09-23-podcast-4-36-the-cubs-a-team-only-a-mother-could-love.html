<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Jeremy begin to wrap up the 2012 season.  We talk about the unexpected performance Soriano exhibited this season.  We predict his future with the Cubs.  Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters continue to struggle and while there's an entire off-season to figure out what the long-term plans with these two are, it's worth mentioning that highly touted prospects that don't work out is a very real possibility when building an organization from the bottom up.  </p>
<p>The Midwest League puzzle pieces are falling into place with the Cubs officially moving to Kane County and the Cardinals moving to Peoria.  As residents of towns with Midwest League teams, we discuss the impact of these moves.  </p>
<p>The post-season picture is becoming clear.  The Reds have won the NL Central.  We take a look at some players that wore Cubs uniforms this season, but have been dealt to playoff contenders and how the teams and those players are doing.  </p>
<p>We look at some listener submitted questions and topics, which include Dr. Who, ballpark food and the upcoming Cubs series with Colorado.  </p>
<p>We've given away some copies of The Essential Games of the Chicago Cubs DVD Box Set with the photo caption contest.  Thank you to A&E Home Entertainment and MLB Productions for these sets.
