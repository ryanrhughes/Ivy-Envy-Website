<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the events of the last week for the Chicago Cubs.  We learned today that Tom Pratt passed away.  Pratt was a pitching coach in the Cubs organization since 2000. Joe Martin did some Spring Training coverage for Ivy Envy this last season.  Wednesday morning, we will post a piece that Joe wrote on his interaction with Pratt at Spring Training. </p>
<p>The Cubs hired Scott Harris, a 25-year old for the Cubs front office.  We discuss if an individual of that age might be a little young for the position.  Or, is this a good move for an organization that could benefit from new and fresh ideas.  </p>
<p>Just a few hours before we recorded, the news broke that Dale Sveum was shot by Robin Yount.  This conversation leads us to stories of Greyhound Bus rides and Tony Zych shooting deer with his girlfriend on hot pink crutches.<br />

<p>We read some <u>Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flexes</u> and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  We believe this photo provided our best collection of captions we've received since we started doing this segment.  </p>
