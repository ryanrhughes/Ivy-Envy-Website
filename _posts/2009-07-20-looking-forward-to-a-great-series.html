  content: I agree with you on the excitement I felt for this series... the excitement
    I felt until last night's game.  That brought me down a little bit.  Ted had a
    bad night, but it doesn't really matter much if the offense can't generate more
    than a single run.  F!

<p>I just started watching game one of the Cubs/Phillies series. Since the Cubs have underperformed the first half of the season, I've had to remind myself that I still really like baseball, good baseball, and just enjoy watching the game without worrying about the standings. After a pretty weak first half the Cubs are just two games out of first. This series looks like it should be a good one. The Phillies have been on fire in the month of July, losing just three of fifteen games and adding on to their pre-all-star winning streak to bring it to eight. The Cubs are coming off a mild confidence booster with a four game sweep of the lowly Nats, whose "W" logo is strikingly similar to Walgreens. Thanks for pointing that out Bob Brenly. The Nats are like the bulls that get sent out to be tortured before the good matador comes out.</p>
<p>With Lilly going tonight I feel pretty good about the Cubs' chances. The Phillies are far better on the road than at home so let's hope that balances out the fact that the Cubs have not played well outside of Wrigley.</p>
<p>Damn, Ted just gave up a three run homer. No worries. He'll settle in and go at least 6.</p>
<p>Maybe not. He just gave up another homer. 5-0 in the second. It's a good thing I'm not getting worked up and just enjoying the game.</p>
