The timing was on the early side, but we all knew Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel were going to be moved prior to the July 31st deadline. The return everyone was expecting was lower level, power arms with high upside to bolster their pitching prospects. We all know that the Cubs have the bats, but the arms weren't there. And for now, that is the way it is staying.</p>
<p>When Hammel and Samardzija were discussed with Billy Beane and Oakland about this trade and Addison Russell was on the table, that was a deal that Theo and Jed had to make, and they did. As a top ten prospect in all of baseball, the 20 year old shortstop pushes the Cubs minor league system to tops in the league. But what else does it mean? A strong chance that the Cubs are closer to winning then we originally thought.</p>
<p>While the original "plan" had the Cubs starting to be competitive in 2014-15, there were strides taken that back-tracked that plan and caused the winning portion of the plan to be pushed back until 2016 or even later. With Kris Bryant jumping up to AAA Iowa recently to join top prospects Javier Baez and Arismendy Alcantara, the window to winning was getting closer to possibly 2016. Now add in Addison Russell to that mix and it could mean 2015 is the time for the Cubs to regain their competitive edge. The Cubs new acquisition arrived in AA Tennessee and many think that he can be up in the majors and help contribute in 2015.</p>
<p>Granted Baez, Russell, and current shortstop Starlin Castro all play the same position, there is movement that could come. Whether it is moving these three into three different positions or moving them out of the organization in general, by way of a trade, there is flexibility. The trade front is interesting because one of these three players could be a centerpiece in a deal to land a front line starter.</p>
<p>Looking forward, this trade signaled that the Cubs are ready to win sooner rather than later. If they would have traded for younger arms, they wouldn't have been ready for the majors until 2016 or later. Add Russell in a lineup that already could project Castro, Baez, Alcantara, Bryant, and first baseman Anthony Rizzo, 2015 look very bright. With these young studs at premium positions, you would think that the Cubs would rather sign a big time free agent pitcher rather than trade one of these young potential stars. However, for now, we can dream about 2015 and beyond with these prospects playing at Wrigley, but it is coming soon Cubs fans.</p>
