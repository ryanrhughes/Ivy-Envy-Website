<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ian-Happ.jpg"><img data-id="11249"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ian-Happ-300x225.jpg" alt="Ian Happ" width="300" height="225" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11249" /></a>Draft Day 1 had the Cubs picking from slots 9 and 47 and excitement swirled as the first two rounds of the drafts felt less certain than years past, but full of promise none the less. One thing Chicago fans could bank on was a front office with a track record of success and a pattern of taking the best college bat with their first pick.</p>
<p>That held true this evening as the Cubs selected Ian Happ out of the University of Cincinnati with their first round pick. Happ, a 6&rsquo;1 switch hitter, raked at a .369 clip for a Bearcats squad that managed to win just 15 out of 56 games this year.</p>
<p>Happ seems best suited for corner outfielder as a professional, though we know Joe Maddon values versatility and Happ can slap some leather at second base, too, if need be, thanks to plus athleticism.</p>
<p>Still, the bat is the calling card, and there is plenty of polish and upside there. Happ got on base at an incredible rate, .492 OBP this year, and didn&rsquo;t sacrifice power in the process, belting 14 homers. He walked nearly once per game, too, showing off an approach that probably had Cubs brass drooling.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh native was a semi-finalist for the Golden Spikes award this year and ESPN&rsquo;s Keith Law called him one of his favorite bats in the draft. It&rsquo;s no surprise then that Bleacher Nation&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ltblaize/status/608062841938132992" target="_blank">Luke Blaize set Happ&rsquo;s MLB ETA as soon as mid-2017</a>, a pace that would likely land him and his power-average combo stroke in Double-A by the end of next year.</p>
<p>With the 47th selection, the Cubs followed suit with pick 9, though not with previous years where they went pitching heavy after Round 1. Yes, in Round 2 they went back to the positional well, taking another proven college bat with experience and success in the Cape Cod League, similar to Happ in that sense.</p>
<p>The pick was Donnie Dewees, a 22 year old out of University of North Florida who lost a year to a broken wrist, but wasted little time returning to form this year, his junior season. Dewees hit a ridiculous .422/.483/.749 this year.</p>
<p>The center fielder is listed at just 5&rsquo;11, 180 pounds, but still packed some punch, hitting 18 homers while striking out just 16 times.</p>
<p>While many will point out a need for pitching in baseball&rsquo;s top farm system, the Cubs have shown they are not afraid to take the best player available each pick and ride the wave of success that follows. There are plenty of opportunities for the Cubs to snag pitching talent, too, see: 2014 MLB Draft which saw the Cubs sign high ceiling arms in Rounds 4, 5, and 6 with Carson Sands, Justin Steele, and Dylan Cease.</p>
