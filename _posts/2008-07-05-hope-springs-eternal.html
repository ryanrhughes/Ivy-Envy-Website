  Traveling across the river to watch the fireworks in Bettendorf threw a monkey wrench into our typical Cubs-viewing routine.&nbsp; We had to discontinue our television viewing just after Edmonds received his standing ovation from the St. Louis crowd before his first at-bat (ho-hum).&nbsp; A small, portable radio informed us of Soto's hardball home run as we played a game of whiffle-ball home run derby.&nbsp; Finally, as the immoderate grand finale was happening, a man sitting near us with earbuds engaged announced to us that the Cubs had won the game.

<p>Even just getting the first win in this series with "<a href="http://ivyenvy.wordpress.com/2008/05/26/new-asshat-of-the-week/" target="_blank">the birds on the bat</a>" (lolz) makes me feel like all is becoming right with the universe.&nbsp; We are out of Mordor and are journeying back to the Shire.&nbsp; Zambrano is back and is looking good.&nbsp; Murton is still with the team.&nbsp; Reed Johnson is back and already contributing, and <a href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_9Bmaq23Hpe8/SCUYzKF2f-I/AAAAAAAAAg8/TqRxCykFU1E/s1600-h/tmflwarrior.jpg" target="_blank">TMFL</a> is pitching tomorrow afternoon.&nbsp; Ram it home, Cubs!</p>
