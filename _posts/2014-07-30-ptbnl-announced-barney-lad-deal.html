  content: Heard they sent Barney down to AAA? Think that's temporary? Was hoping
    to see him play next series...

<p>On July 22nd, the Cubs designated second baseman Darwin Barney for assignment. This meant that the Cubs would have to trade or place Barney on waivers within 10 days or he would be released. On Monday, the Cubs found a trading partner, sending the former Gold Glover to the Los Angeles Dodgers for a player to be named later. That player was announced this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Cubs acquired 20 year old, right handed pitcher Jonathan Martinez. The right hander has pitched this year in Low A Great Lakes in the Midwest League. Martinez has pitched in 19 games for the Loons this year, starting all of them, while compiling a 3.47 ERA in 106.1 innings. The 20 year old has only walked 19 batters in that span while striking out 91 and posting a career high 4.79 strikeout to walk ratio. Martinez will likely land in Low A Kane County, which will put him back in the Midwest League. Last week, the righty was ranked as the number 19th prospect in the Dodgers organization by <a href="http://dodgersdigest.com/2014/07/14/midseason-los-angeles-dodgers-top-25-prospects/">dodgersdigest.com</a>. Here is what the site said about Martinez:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong style="font-weight: bold; color: #2c3e50;">19.&nbsp;<strong style="font-weight: bold;"><a style="color: #005596;" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=martin005jon&amp;utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-dodgersdigest.com" target="_blank">Jonathan Martinez</a></strong>, RHP (Ranked in Pre-Season list: 35,&nbsp;<span style="color: #339966;">+16</span>)</strong><span style="color: #2c3e50;">&nbsp;</span><em style="color: #2c3e50;"><br />
Started:&nbsp;Low-A Great Lakes</em><span style="color: #2c3e50;">&nbsp;</span><em style="color: #2c3e50;"><br />
Current location:&nbsp;Great Lakes<br />
</em><span style="color: #2c3e50;">- Martinez had a rough 2013 season split between Ogden and Great Lakes. This season, he&rsquo;s basically the Loons&rsquo; ace and has posted a couple of really stellar performances, including a 6-inning, 2-hit, 11-strikeout game to start his 2014 season. He has great command, as he has a career-best 1.4 BB/9 and has increased his strikeout rate from 5.7 per nine last year in Midland to 7.7 this year. He could get a call to Rancho if someone there is promoted. If not, he&rsquo;ll be there next year.</span></blockquote><br />
As for Barney, he has been sent down to AAA Albuquerque.</p>
