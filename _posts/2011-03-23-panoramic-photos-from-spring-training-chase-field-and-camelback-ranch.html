<p>Yesterday, I <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4376" target="_blank">posted panoramic photos</a> of Fitch Park (the Cubs Spring Training practice facility) and Tempe Diablo Stadium, during the Cubs vs. Angels game.  Today, we took a tour of Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.  We also went to the White Sox/Dodgers Spring Training facility to see the Dodgers host the Cubs. &nbsp;My iPod has a panoramic photo app that isn't that great, but makes for some interesting photos. &nbsp;Here are a few I took today.  Click on the photos to view the large versions.<br />
