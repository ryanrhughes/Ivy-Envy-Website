  Why should I have expected anything different?

  It is the top of the 8th and I am confident enough that the Cubs will not score 7 runs in 6 outs to write this.&nbsp; The now-annual lack of offense in the playoffs is disgusting.&nbsp; Ok....another run for LA.&nbsp; Now the Cubs need 8 runs in 6 outs.&nbsp;

  What hurts more,&nbsp; years of losing seasons or annual collapses in the playoffs?&nbsp; Perhaps Dick Stockton wouldn't seem so bad if we weren't suffering through

<p>Why should I have expected anything different?</p>
<p>It is the top of the 8th and I am confident enough that the Cubs will not score 7 runs in 6 outs to write this.&nbsp; The now-annual lack of offense in the playoffs is disgusting.&nbsp; Ok....another run for LA.&nbsp; Now the Cubs need 8 runs in 6 outs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What hurts more,&nbsp; years of losing seasons or annual collapses in the playoffs?&nbsp; Perhaps Dick Stockton wouldn't seem so bad if we weren't suffering through<a id="more"></a><a id="more-257"></a>&nbsp;poor play by the Cubs.&nbsp; Seriously, Dick...a bad play in the field isn't called an "era".&nbsp; Error has an "o" and an "r" at the end of the word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my last post and in many posts on here, I identify myself as the pessimistic Cubs fan.&nbsp; That will probably never change.&nbsp; Yet I still can't shake the feeling that this team is capable of ripping off 2 wins in LA and bringing this series back to Chicago.&nbsp; We have seen them roll off winning streaks and unlikely wins all season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take it one game at a time, though.&nbsp; For Game 3, the Cubs need to:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Find their offense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Harden needs to get some quick outs and keep the pitch count down so he can last more than 5 innings.</p>
<p>I was just discussing with Manstrength that I think the Cubs need to get out of Chicago.&nbsp; Get them out in LA, let them pull together and take on an "us against the world" attitude.&nbsp; The pressure is just stupid in Chicago.&nbsp; I honestly think they can take Game 3.</p>
