<p>Spring Training is underway and since we at Ivy Envy will not be in Mesa to provide any coverage, we feel an obligation to point our readers towards some sources for up-to-the-minute information.</p>
<p>First, <a href="http://www.collegeofidiots.com/" target="_blank">College of Idiots</a> is based out of the Phoenix area and have heeded the call to provide readers with the happenings in the Valley of the Sun.&nbsp; Are you planning a trip to Mesa for Spring Training?&nbsp; These guys will give you the inside info on where to go, what to avoid and where the coldest beer in the area is.&nbsp; But these guys provide entertaining insight regarding the Cubs beyond Spring Training and throughout the whole season.&nbsp; Bookmark this site and check back often.&nbsp; You can also follow College of Idiots on Twitter <a href="www.twitter.com/CollegeOfIdiots" target="_blank">@CollegeofIdiots</a>.</p>
<p>The other blog you should be checking out for Spring Training coverage is <a href="http://www.boysofspring.com/journal/journal2.php" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>.&nbsp; Boys of Spring is a blog written by Tim Sheridan.&nbsp; Sheridan serves as the Cubs Spring Training P.A. Address Announcer.&nbsp; Not only does he provide some analysis of what's going on in Mesa, but he posts some great pictures.&nbsp; You can also follow Tim on Twitter <a href="www.twitter.com/BoysOfSpring" target="_blank">@BoysOfSpring</a>.</p>
<p>These are the blogs and Twitter accounts we'll be watching this March and April, and you should too.&nbsp; To give you a taste of Boys of Spring, here are some photos from their website:</p>
