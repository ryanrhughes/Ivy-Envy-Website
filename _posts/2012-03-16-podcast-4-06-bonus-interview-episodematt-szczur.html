<p>Welcome to another bonus episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  In January, I went to the Cubs Caravan stop in Peoria and had a few minutes to talk with Matt Sczcur.  Most experts rank Matt as the 4th or 5th best prospect in the Cubs' system.  The former Villanova wide receiver was picked by the Cubs in the 5th round of the 2010 draft.  Szczur spent time in Peoria and Daytona last year and will most likely start 2012 with double A Tennessee.  </p>
<p>This was a very short interview.  The Cubs bus was very late because of  weather and my time with him was limited.  So here's my brief conversation with Matt Szczur.</p>
