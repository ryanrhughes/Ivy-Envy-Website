  content: I'm excited to see what Derek Johnson and Chris Bosio can do for Straily.  If
    you remember, when they acquired Arrietta last season, they sent him down to the
    minors for a few weeks to get acclimated and work with Johnson before coming to
    the major league team.

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/07/strailyjpg-6fb0bba47e258695.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/07/strailyjpg-6fb0bba47e258695-300x210.jpg" alt="strailyjpg-6fb0bba47e258695" width="300" height="210" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10202" /></a>While everyone is excited about landing Addison Reed and Billy McKinney, it's actually the third piece, right-hander <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=573185">Dan Straily</a>, that Cubs fans will most likely see first. The oohs and ahhs came on the offensive side of this Independence Day trade, but&nbsp;the Cubs also landed a young man with Major League experience that they can control for the next half decade.</p>
<p>Straily, who is 6-foot-2, 215 pounds and 25 years old, already has 41 Major League games under his belt, with a 13-11 career record with a 4.11 ERA. As recently as two years ago, he was thought of as potentially Oakland's ace of the future in the mold of Mark Mulder and&nbsp;Tim Hudson. He made his major league debut in 2012, at which point he was leading all of baseball with 175 strikeouts that season.</p>
<p>In 2013 Straily got the bulk of his Major League time, making 27 starts and finishing fourth in the AL Rookie of the Year voting, tallying a 10-8 record with a 3.96 ERA and 124 strikeouts in 152 innings. He also made one start in the ALDS, giving up 3 earned runs in 6 innings while taking the loss to Detroit, though he did strike out 8 Tigers that night.</p>
<p>Straily was drafted in the 24th round in 2009 and throws a fastball, change, curve and slider. In the minors, his lowest K/9 rate was 8.6 and he was regularly in double digits. While that number obviously dipped at the Major League level, he still maintains a healthy 7.4 rate. Straily will give up runs, so the Cubs offense will need to show up in his starts. In his 27 starts last year for Oakland, he surrendered at least one run in 24 of them. He&nbsp;also struggles giving up home runs, allowing at least one in 13 of 17 starts in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2012 Straily was ranked by Baseball America with the best control in the Texas League along with the best slider and change up in the Oakland system.</p>
<p>On June 14th of this year, Straily faced the Iowa Cubs. He went seven innings allowing five hits and three walks while striking out nine (including Javier Baez twice) in a victory.</p>
<p>Straily is eligible for arbitration in 2016 and can become a free agent in 2019.</p>
