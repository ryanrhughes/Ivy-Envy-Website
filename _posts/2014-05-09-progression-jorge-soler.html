<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jorge-Soler-Cubs-suspended.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jorge-Soler-Cubs-suspended-300x199.jpg" alt="Jorge Soler" width="300" height="199" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9905" /></a>While discussing the Cubs top prospects, the "Big Four" nickname always seems to pop up. These four players are Javier Baez, Kris Bryant, Albert Almora, and Jorge Soler. Now, out of those four prospects, Soler is the one who gets the least attention. He is the only one of the four that was not drafted, which tends to have people to not hype him up. Now, he obviously gets publicity, being the 46th ranked prospect by Baseball Prospectus, but he is a forgotten piece that can be an impact outfielder in the big leagues in the next few years.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2012, the Cubs agreed to terms with the Cuban outfielder on a nine year, $30 million deal. Soler was only 20 at the time, and could not get significant playing time because of citizenship issues. He started his 2012 season in Arizona with the Rookie League team and made his way up to Low-A Peoria to play 20 games at the end of the year. The outfielder hit .338 with a .910 OPS in those 20 games.</p>
<p>Soler got a promotion to High-A Daytona last year to begin the season. He played only 55 games, but his season was cut short due to a stress fracture in his shin that caused him to miss the remainder of the season. Soler, while injured, missed a chance to play for the World Team in the Future's Game, as well. The 22 year old healed up and played during the Arizona Fall League last year. He hit .271 with a .688 OPS in 20 games with the Mesa Solar Sox. Going into 2014, this was supposed to be the year that he plays a full season and breaks out.</p>
<p>The start of the 2014 season, Soler was assigned to Double A Tennessee and was in the starting lineup for their Opening Day. His first at bat ended with Soler hitting a double, but he came up lame. A hamstring strain was the diagnosis and it was just a waiting game until he could get back into game action. About a week to ten days ago, Soler played with the Mesa Cubs in Arizona and began playing again. On Wednesday he was finally back. Slated in the starting lineup, the outfielder had to be scratched due to travel issues, but he was available later in the game. So that would mean we would have to wait another day for Soler's return. On Thursday, he was back in the lineup. Soler went 2-2 (a double and single) in the game with 2 RBI's, 2 walks, and a run scored. For those counting at home, yes, he is batting 1.000.</p>
<p>Only through two games, Soler is getting ready to break out. Hitting in the middle of the Tennessee order, right behind Kris Bryant, only can help as well. If Soler can continue to hit and play a full season, he can see a promotion to Iowa very soon. This is the third year of that nine year deal, and he is also on the 40 man roster. Hopefully he can become the right fielder that the Cubs envision him being and can be a force in the middle of the lineup in 2016 or sooner.</p>
