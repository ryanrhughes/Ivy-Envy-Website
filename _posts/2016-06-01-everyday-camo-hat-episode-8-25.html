On this episode, we look back on how the Cubs performed (as a team and individuals) in the month of May.  While it seemed like the team was spinning it's wheels at times, they ended the season 18-10.  </p>
<p>We get a little more specific and talk about the Cubs sweep over the Phillies over the weekend and the first few games of the series against the Dodgers at Wrigley.  The first two games of the Dodgers series provided us with an incredibly good and an incredibly bad performance by the Cubs bullpen.  We look into that a bit.  </p>
<p>Kurt provides us with a Jake Arrieta scary stat, Andy shares a Rube Waddell story, and we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
