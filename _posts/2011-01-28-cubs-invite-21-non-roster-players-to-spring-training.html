<p>Today, the Cubs signed Braden Looper and Augie Ojeda to minor league contracts that include invitations to Spring Training.&nbsp; Most Cubs fans will remember Looper for his years with the Cardinals.&nbsp; Looper last pitched in 2009 for the Brewers.&nbsp; He posted a 14-7 record despite an ERA of 5.22.&nbsp; The Brewers did not pick up his option for the 2010 season.</p>
<p>Ojeda, a utility infielder that spent the first four season of his career with the Cubs, is a career .234 hitter.&nbsp; The only sense I can make out of this move is that the Cubs feel they could use Ojeda's <a href="http://www.walkoffwalk.com/2009/09/augie-ojeda-destroys-innocent.html" target="_blank">protection against hazardous remote control airplanes </a>during spring training.</p>
<p>Looper and Ojeda will join Reed Johnson and Todd Wellemeyer as veteran players fighting the young talent from the Cubs system for spots on the roster.&nbsp; There are quite a few names that Cubs fans have been hearing about for a few years.&nbsp; Spring Training will give us a chance to see guys like Chris Carpenter, Jay Jackson, Trey McNutt, Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters display their talent against some (at times) major league talent.&nbsp; Spring Training is never a great opportunity to judge the players because they are often facing the up-and-coming young talent of the opposing clubs.</p>
<p>The Cubs have also invited apparently the only player they could find with as much minor league experience as invitee Bobby Scales.&nbsp; The Cubs have invited 12 year minor league veteran Scott Rice.&nbsp; All that the lefty pitcher Rice lacks is Scales' 61 games of major league experience.</p>
<p>Other players invited to the 2011 Spring Training are:&nbsp; James Adduci, Steve Clevenger, Matt Camp, Angel Guzman, Brian LaHair, Luis Montanez, Scott Moore, Chris Robinson, Marquez Smith and Brad Snyder.</p>
