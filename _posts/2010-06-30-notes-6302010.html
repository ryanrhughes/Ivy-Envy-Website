<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Since I'm on vacation, I don't want to ruin this time of relaxation by actually putting together a thought-out post about this crummy team.&nbsp; So I'll just put together a few thoughts here.</em></p></p>
<ul>
<li>Since unloading 12 runs on the Angels in the final game of that series, the Cubs' offense has disappeared.&nbsp; Since that game, the Cubs have averaged 2.25 runs per game.&nbsp; In the month of June, before this stretch, the Cubs were averaging 4.4 runs per game.&nbsp; The interesting thing about writing about the Cubs now is that, since I've given up hope for this season, these types of stats don't drive me nuts like they would if the Cubs were in contention.&nbsp; I almost see these stretches as an encouraging sign to see the Cubs start working towards building a winning team for the future.&nbsp; Until that begins to happen, we will sit and wait for the moves to start happening.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>On the last podcast, I predicted that Zambrano would be moved to the bullpen when he returns to the team.&nbsp; I hope that the Cubs put Z in his place and keep his role minuscule.&nbsp; At this point, I doubt the Cubs have much concern with his trade value.&nbsp; Everything that has happened with Z this year has diminished his trade value, and I would say that last week's blow-up did more to hurt it than his move to the bullpen earlier in the season.&nbsp; It's just another contract that the Cubs will have to eat.&nbsp; I don't think Hendry can pull off another trade of an undesirable player like he did with Milton Bradley.&nbsp; I can't imagine the Cubs not being on the losing end of a Zambrano trade.</li><br />
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure I can wear my Zambrano t-shirt jersey anymore.&nbsp; Looks like I might need a replacement seeing as how I ruined my Ramirez one with oil while BBQ-ing and the other one I have is a Samardzija one.&nbsp; I haven't turned on Samardzija, but I don't think I want to endure the heckling.&nbsp; But I have three of these shirts and none of the players are worth representing at this point.</li><br />
</ul><br />
And that sums up this week's episode of dilemmas in Corey's wardrobe.&nbsp; Thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next week.</p>
