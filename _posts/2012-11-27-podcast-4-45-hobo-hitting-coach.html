<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss a few of the moves the Cubs made in the last week.  Rob Deer was hired to fill the position of Assistant Hitting Coach.  We talk about the idea of a career .220 hitter that was legendary for striking out coaching the young players of the organization on hitting.  The Cubs add another piece to the rotation by signing Scott Feldman.</p>
<p>We answer some listener-submitted questions, read a humorous Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flex and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
