<p>The Cubs call up and pick up some pitchers.  The Cubs had three minor league teams in the post-season.  We talk about Daytona's success in the playoffs.  Boise and Tennessee both come up short.  </p>
<p>We then go through listener questions, Kurt returns with his Scary Stat of the Week segment and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
