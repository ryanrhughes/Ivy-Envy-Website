<p>Greg Maddux was hired as an assistant to Jim Hendry today.&nbsp; For the last two or three years, I've fantasized about Greg Maddux replacing Larry Rothschild.&nbsp; Regardless of his&nbsp; job duties, I'm glad to see Maddux involved with the Cubs.&nbsp; I also don't feel as dirty about the Cubs retiring Maddux's jersey, considering he chose to continue his post-player baseball career with the Cubs.</p>
<p>Imagine, the Maddux vs. Steve Stone for GM debates when Hendry resigns/is fired.</p>
