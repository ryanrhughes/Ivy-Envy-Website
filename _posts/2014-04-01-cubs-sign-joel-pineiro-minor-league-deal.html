<p>The Cubs have added more pitching depth by signing Joel Pineiro to a minor league deal.<br />

<p>If his name sounds familiar, Pineiro previously played for the Cardinals.  He has not pitched since the 2011 season with the Angels and has suffered from shoulder issues since.  It's hard to predict what Pineiro will amount to for the Cubs, but he is a veteran with a lot of major league experience and has exhibited good control, really limiting walks.  </p>
<p>This is a low-risk move for the Cubs and it'll be interesting to see how it plays out.  </p>
