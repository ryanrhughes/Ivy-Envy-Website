<p>I couldn't wait until the Cubs faced Yusmeiro Petit to attempt some creative headline like that.  Now I'd like to see the Cubs face him again since he gave up 7 earned runs in 3 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Of course, the big news of the 11-3 victory was Carlos Zambrano.  On the mound, Zambrano went 7 innings and gave up 3 runs with 3 strikeouts.  He had a more memorable performance at the plate.  Zambrano was a triple away from hitting for the cycle.  He went 3-4 with a double, homerun and 2 RBI's and he was about 2 feet short of having 2 HR's on the night.  By the night's end, Zambrano's batting average went from .000 to .231.</p>
<p>I'm glad to see Milton Bradley come back to the team while they are on the road.  Right now, I don't trust Cubs fans to be level-headed enough to realize that booing and heckling Bradley does not help him, or more importantly, this team in any way.  As long as he wears a blue hat with a red "C" on it, I want him to turn things around.&nbsp; If he needs a standing ovation every time he comes to the plate to get some confidence back, I'll support it. He will hit.  The guy hit .321 last season and played well in Spring Training.  His bat will warm up.  I just hope that he hasn't been written off by everyone at that point like Jacque Jones was in 2007.  This is a small slice of a lively conversation we had in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=682">Episode #6 of the podcast</a>.</p>
<p>Derek Lee comes back today and hopefully this team is on it's way to putting back the broken pieces.</p>
