<p>First off, I'd like to apologize for our lack of activity on the site, and taking a week off from the Ivy Envy Podcast.  Consider it a re-charging of our batteries heading into the 2012 season.  </p>
<p>Pitchers and catchers are to report to Mesa in less than a week and many players have already arrived at Fitch and begun working out, in preparation of the 2012 MLB season.  Unfortunately, we won't be in Mesa this year to cover some of Spring Training.  We had the time of our lives out there last year.  It was an incredible opportunity to spend a week hanging out at Fitch, watching the minor league guys practice and scrimmage and then head to the afternoon game to sit in the sun and watch some stress-free baseball, then head back to the hotel to relay what we saw to Cubs fans around the world via our podcast.  I hope to have the opportunity to get to Mesa next year.  </p>
<p>Since you can't count on us for first-hand updates from the desert, we encourage you to check out <a href="http://journal.boysofspring.com/" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>.  We give you this recommendation every February and as long as Tim Sheridan keeps sharing information and photos, we'll be sending you his way.  We have had Tim on the podcast a few times to talk about his experiences as the PA Announcer at Hohokam (<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4557" target="_blank">Podcast Episode - 3.12</a>), and his creation, <strong>Boys of Spring - The Movie</strong> (<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5969" target="_blank">Podcast Episode - 3.34</a>).  </p>
<p>For those of us suffering through the final weeks of winter, Tim's photos and blog posts serve as a reminder that Spring and baseball are on the way.  You won't find better photos of Spring Training, period.  And his information is geared towards fans - honest and interesting (two things you often won't find in write-ups from the "real" media covering Spring Training).  </p>
<p>Our baseball drought is nearly over, Cubs fans.  </p>
