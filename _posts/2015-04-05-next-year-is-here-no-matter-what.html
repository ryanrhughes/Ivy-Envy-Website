<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/118654340">Chicago Cubs - 2015 Hype</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/user10524313">Jay Tuohey</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>It's a strange thing being a Cubs fan. We're used to the disappointment, used to the failed youngsters (The Corey Patterson All-Stars sponsored by Jerome Walton), used to the jokes. And there's the lowest of the low: the pity. Since moving to the San Francisco Bay area at the end of 2013, I've made a point to buy tickets to the Giants-Cubs series out here every year. Last year, as I was wading through the crowd after one of the games, a Giants fan passing by did a double-take at my blue hat, thinking at first it was for the rival Dodgers. His scowl melted into a look that screamed, "Bless your heart." As he passed by, he patted me on the shoulder and said, "Sorry, man." This after the Cubs had actually <em>beaten</em> the Giants. The losing team's fans were apologizing <em>to me</em>.</p>
<p>What's even stranger is the feeling of having, well, hope. I talked before about the "<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/chicago-cubs-cycle-hope/">cycles of hope</a>" we've been through as fans of this team. But this year, it's different. There's a different feel, a different look to the team. Maybe it's the ongoing renovations at Wrigley, finally updating an aging (wonderful) relic into something that can continue on into its next 100 years. Maybe it's the attitude of the new skipper, Joe Maddon, and the track record of success he brings with him. Or maybe it's because there's so much chatter around the team and the recent demotion (and impending promotion) of Kris Bryant. But the Cubs matter again and as Opening Night approaches, the first pitch just hours away, to be hurled by the team's big free agent pick up, this season <em>feels important</em> for the first time in ages.</p>
<p>If you're a regular listener of ESPN's Baseball Tonight podcast or at least a regular reader of Buster Olney, you've had the Kris Bryant storyline nearly crammed down your throat. It's hardly the first time a major prospect has started the season in the minor leagues. And it won't be the last. But all the conversation around what seems to be a sure-fire Rookie of the Year winner... involves the Cubs? Scott Boras railing against the treatment of a star client... involves the Cubs? And these cover stories: The Sporting News chose the Cubs to win the World Series. The cynical side of me sees this as some Grade-A trolling by a St. Louis publication but a friend <a href="https://twitter.com/jowens510/status/584180854051569665/photo/1">pointed out the recent cover</a> of Bloomberg Business Week featuring guess who? (You Can read <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-01/the-chicago-cubs-finally-have-a-winning-business-plan">the entire story here</a>).</p>
<p>There's honest-to-God buzz around the Cubs. They're in the playoff conversation. Most predictions have the Cubs on the outside of the NL playoffs looking in but that's mainly because of a loaded NL Central with the rival Cardinals and the Pirates leading the bunch. <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/preview15/story/_/id/12603383/mlb-preview-nl-central">The ESPN MLB preview offers</a> the most concise version of the sentiment surrounding the Cubs right now.</p>
<p>From David Schoenfield: "The Cubs won't win it all in 2015, but few teams are better-positioned to do so in the near future."</p>
<p>And from Dan Szymborski: "A wild card in 2015 is possible, but ZiPS still thinks the Cubs are about a .500 team. But the best is mostly yet to come."</p>
<p>It's a fair assessment and one that makes sense to Cubs fans who have watched this rebuild (in every sense of the word). But it's also what makes this season so exciting. When the Cubs last made a playoff push in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, it was clear that it would give way to a crash. Aging stars and few prospects were utilized, the team spending copious amounts of cash to contend (sorta like the Padres this years except that squad has a more solid pitching staff). But now? There's that hope. That hope that no matter what happens, the future is still bright. There are so many terrific prospects the Cubs literally do not have room for them all.</p>
<p>ESPN's Keith Law recently <a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/insider/story/_/id/12211903/chicago-cubs-no-1-farm-system-rankings-2015-mlb">named the Cubs</a> as the top farm system in the league and <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=25592">Baseball Prospectus agrees</a>. And it goes beyond Baez, Bryant and Soler. There's Schwarber, Russell, McKinley, Torres, Almora and on and on and on. What Theo &amp; Co. have done is essential to long-term success: build a system from the ground up, putting the team in a place to improve and maintain a high level of quality with a flow of players internally or via trade. If the team needs a key player to complete a run, we now have a front office we can trust to make the move that won't be a detriment to the team.</p>
<p>And it's a front office who has been through this exact cycle before: rebuilding, adding via trade and free agency, a renovation of an ancient stadium. And it's a front office that has made the tough cuts before. We know that something will have to give with that crowded infield. Theo did the same thing in Boston; Cubs fans <a href="http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/08/01/sox_trade_nomar_to_cubs_at_deadline/?page=full">will remember the Nomar trade</a> because, well, we got him in the deal. For the Red Sox, losing a name synonymous with team hurt at the time, but the players they got in return, Doug Mientkiewicz and (especially) Orlando Cabrera, <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2012/08/25/notable-deals-red-sox-history/O8ioEXT2Muw1YmkJlwSuaK/story.html">contributed to the Sox winning the 2004 World Series</a> title.</p>
<p>Oh yeah. That. The end of an eternally long (in that case, 86 years) World Series drought. Theo's done that, too. Huh.</p>
<p>I know  I cautioned against hope in that previous story, pointing out all those times just within my 36 years on this Earth that the team has been through similar bouts of optimism. But this does <em>feel different</em>. I can't remember a time when the team was <strong>this loaded</strong> from the big league team all the way down the line. I can't remember a time when there was this much talk around the Cubs, a team with the kind of depth that makes other squads envious. A team with an ownership dedicated to the long-term rebuild of the team and stadium. A team with a front office that's made the moves before to win a title, that knows the pressure of winning a title after a long drought in a big baseball town. A team with a manager that's been to the World Series, that's made the tough calls in tight spots.</p>
<p>No, the odds are against the Cubs making it to the playoffs this year even if it's a possibility. The Cards and Buccos are tough. They've got the experience and there's a good reason they're picked to top the division this year. But this team, this Cubs team, is built for the long haul. Maybe not this year, but soon. And that's why this season is so important: not because "107 years" may finally reset to "zero." But because this team matters again. This team is going to matter for a long time. We're talking about whether or not Kris Bryant will leave the team when his contract is up <em>in 2021</em>. There are three Olympics between now and then! That's an eternity. And with the talent that can be cycled up or traded away for more talent, we finally have what we didn't have 5 years ago. Or 10 years ago. We have a brain-trust we can, well, trust and a team that's capable of fulfilling the goal.</p>
<p>So what if this team doesn't make the playoffs? It doesn't mean the season will be a failure. What we need is a .500 or better season. Since the 2012 nadir of 61-101, the team has improved the win totals in each of the last two seasons. A final tally if 81-81 or better will set the stage for next year (I know, I know) when the team can make one or two more off-season moves (trading one of those infielders? Bringing in Cueto or Zimmerman?) and put them at the forefront of the National League.</p>
<p>But that begins tonight. When Lester takes the mound at a stadium that's missing the 5,000-plus seats in the under-construction bleachers, it's no less significant. It's symbolic of the the last seven years since this team last made the playoffs, of the tumble down the hill and the slow, long climb back up. For the Cubs, the future is finally here and it begins when Lester fires in that first pitch. Whether it's this year or next year or five years from now, the future we've been waiting for, the "Wait til next year!" we yelled every season when the Cubs were officially counted out (which got earlier and earlier in the season), it's here.</p>
<p>The naysayers will continue to laugh and mock and poke and show pity. "107 years! How about 108?" they'll say as they pat us on the head. But there's reason to believe again. There's reason to look upon tonight's starting lineup and know that it's just the starting point, that by Father's Day, it'll feature a few different names but that it'll be  better for it. And that it's just the beginning.</p>
<p>It's okay to think this is team. It's okay to admit that we're buying in. It's okay to think about the day when <strong><em>it</em></strong> finally happens.</p>
<p>Starting right now, it's okay to hope.</p>
<p>Because without hope, what's the point?</p>
