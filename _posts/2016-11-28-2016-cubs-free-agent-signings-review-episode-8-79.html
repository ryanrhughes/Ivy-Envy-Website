On this episode, we look back at the four bigger free agent signings the Cubs made before the 2016 season.  We talk about Ben Zobrist, Dexter Fowler, John Lackey, and Jason Heyward.  We look at their regular season and post-season performances and share who we think was the most valuable addition to the team. </p>
