  content: I hate comments like "you're acting like you've already won" and "act like
    you've been there." It ignores the context. In the case of the Cubs, it's been
    71 years. We have the right to be excited about it. And telling people that they
    have to act like they've been there before means we can't have fun or show any
    emotion.

<p>On this episode, we spend a lot of time talking through some of the emotions we are feeling, the morning after.  This was one of the podcast episodes we've been waiting to record, but there's an even bigger one out there, that could happen very soon. </p>
<p>We do eventually talk about the baseball side of Game 6 and we preview the 2016 World Series, and specifically Game 1.  </p>
