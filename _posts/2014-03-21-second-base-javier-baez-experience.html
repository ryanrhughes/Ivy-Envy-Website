<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/Baez-Fielding.jpeg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/Baez-Fielding-300x223.jpeg" alt="Baez-Fielding" width="300" height="223" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9236" /></a>Everyone going into Cubs spring training was excited to see one person. No it wasn't Starlin Castro. It was to see Javier Baez. Baez, the Cubs minor league player of the year last season and the top prospect in the organization, is on the cusp of making it to Chicago with the big league club and he has everyone watching.</p>
<p>Baez is a primary shortstop and has played there all through the minors with the Cubs since being drafted in 2011. The only problem is that the Cubs already have a shortstop, the aforementioned Starlin Castro. Going into spring, manager Rick Renteria and the front office said that Javier Baez would try different spots in the infield to accommodate Castro and try to play both of them as they expect Baez to find his way to the majors in 2014. He got his first crack at a second position this last week, playing second base.</p>
<p>During the spring training game on Tuesday against the Rangers, Baez got his first chance to play second base, as he was in the starting lineup hitting fifth. He went 2-5 with an opposite field home run off of Rangers' starter Alexi Ogando. It has been the only day he has started at second so far, but he's expected to get more time there as spring rolls on before he is sent to Iowa to start the season.</p>
<p>Now, everyone continues to ask the question if Baez will leave camp and head to Pittsburgh with the big league club. But, he is not. &nbsp;He will be the starting shortstop at Iowa for the length of time till the Super Two deadline, even if he does continue to crush baseballs and send Twitter into a frenzy every time he is at the plate.</p>
<p>Regardless, Renteria will continue putting him in the lineup at second, just in case. If Castro can hit the way he did before last year and Baez can continue hitting baseballs 450 plus feet, that can be a dangerous combo in the middle of the infield. Sorry Darwin Barney, you're getting benched for Javy time.</p>
