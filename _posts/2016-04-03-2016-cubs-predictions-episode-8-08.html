  content: I think all of you are low on your prediction for the number of wins the
    Cubs will have this season. I know a lot of the experts are predicting the Cubs
    will win about the same number of games, but due to how polarized the National
    League is going to be (The Braves, Brewers, Phillies, Padres, Reds, Rockies and
    Marlins are all rebuilding) I'm predicting that the Cubs are going to win at least
    105 games. Because of this extreme circumstance my bold prediction is that a team
    could win 100 games or more and miss the playoffs this season. That team might
    be the Cardinals.

  content: A prediction I wanted to talk about was the number of players from this
    season opening day roster who won't be with the team by the end of the year. Normally
    there is a fair amount of turn over in a roster from the beginning of thee year
    to the end of the year, but this year's roster is different. Some of the players
    who might have gotten called up this year got called up a year early (Addison
    Russell and Kyle Schwarber). A number of this year's prospects are making the
    jump from AA to AAA (Contreras, Almora and Candelario). Of course the trade for
    a young, cost controlled pitcher may finally happen, but a number of the other
    motivations for trade have already been addressed before the season even began.
    This year's team is deep at nearly every position. I agree that Szczur probably
    won't be with the team all year long. And the bullpen probably won't carry so
    many pitchers all season long so something will give there too, but don't forget
    that this will year three of a bullpen core of Rondon, Strop, Grim and Ramirez.
    I wrote even wrote an article called "The Cubs 2017 Opening Day roster could be
    remarkably similar to their 2016 Opening Day Roster" at fansperspective.net/chicagocubs/2016/4/4/opening-day-2017-vs-2016
