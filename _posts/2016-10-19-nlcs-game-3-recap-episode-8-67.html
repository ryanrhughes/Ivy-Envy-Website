For the second game in a row, the Cubs had their offense shut down by Dodgers pitching, this time it was former-Cub, Rich Hill.</p>
<p>This episode is what you would expect from a Cubs podcast recorded moments after a playoff loss.  There's anger, frustration, and maybe just a little optimism.  Consider this a group therapy session.  </p>
