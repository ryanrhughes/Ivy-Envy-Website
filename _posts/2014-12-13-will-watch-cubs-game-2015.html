  content: As a Cubs fan from Iowa who has enjoy getting 140 to 150 games on my direct
    TV package this is kinda upsetting. I wonder if the wgn games will still be on
    in Iowa. 80 games on csn and no way to purchase the rest of the games really disenfranchised
    a huge part of the Cubs fan base.

  content: Anthony Schulte - WGN America is declining to air Chicago sports.  WGN-9
    (over the air) in Chicago will air the 60ish games.  Why show Cubs games with
    Jon Lester, Kris Bryant, Starlin Castro, Anthony Rizzo, Javier Baez, Jorge Soler,
    etc. when you can show 3 hours of New Adventures of Old Christine and America's
    Funniest Home Videos?

    go wrong with subscribing. I am blacked out for 6 west coast teams but I am able
    to watch all of the cubs games unless they are playing the west coast teams.  I
    assume the 25 games will be available for out of market coverage?

  content: I thought the TV deal with WGN was through 2015? I'm not working around
    an asinine system to watch them. Their job is to make it as easy as possible to
    consume their product. Not harder. If I have to pay extra, then I'm done. It's
    just absurd.

  content: Jeff Kilgard The contract ended at the end of 2014.  I believe the Cubs
    wanted to continue with WGN until their contract, but WGN America does not want
    to carry Chicago sports.  That's why the games will be on WGN-9 not WGN America.  The
    problem is that the two tv contacts (1. CSN 2. All of the other games) do not
    line up, so the Cubs need a short-term solution for these games that used to be
    on WGN until the CSN contract is up.

  content: This absolutely sucks for Cubs fans around the midwest.  Dodgers fans in
    So-cal that don't have TimeWarner Cable (that amounts to 2/3 of Los Angeles)
    faced a similar situation, except they were unable to see ANY Dodgers games this
    last season.  TimeWarner would not sell SportsNetLA to DirecTV, Dish, etc.  The
    Dodgers had nothing to do with this....just like the Cubs are not to blame for
    this situation.  They obviously want their product available to their fans.

  content: One more thing. In this piece (which if you haven't read yet, you should),
    Kurt talks about contacting your local affiliates.  I'm going to make this QC
    based because that's our hometown.  Channel (ABC) has that 8.3 or 8.2 digital
    station available over the air and on Mediacom.  The last few years, they've played
    the WCIU games on this station.  WLS-7 is an ABC affiliate and perhaps Channel
    8 would play those on that station.  As for the WGN-9 games, WGN-9 is affiliated
    with the CW.  I would encourage Cubs fans in the QC to contact the CW station
    to see if they would air those games locally on that station.  Chances are, the
    WLS-7 and WGN-9 games will be day games and weekends because they would have regularly
    scheduled primetime shows.  That means most of the night games during the week
    (which most of us are available to watch) will be on CSN.   Whether you're in
    the QC or not, it's not too early to contact your local ABC and CW affiliates.  Make
    them aware of the situation and encourage other Cubs fans in your areas to do
    the same.

  content: Dawn Strand It doesn't benefit MLB.tv.  It's that the local networks have
    exclusivity and the broadcast rights.  I'm not a broadcast expert, but I think
    sports are huge in keeping cable and dish networks afloat.  We would have cut
    the cord years ago if Cubs games weren't blacked out on MLB.tv for us.

    them to carry the WLS games on Channel 8.3 (but you won't get that on DirecTV)
    and KGCW (the CW) to carry the games that will be on WGN-9.

  content: I really wish I could be more active in this conversation. But kids and
    stuff. The simple answer...If you live outside the blackout area you can get MLB.tv
    and you are good to go. If you live within the blackout area there is absolutely
    no "by the book" way to watch those games that will be aired on WLS and WGN-9
    (local). I might be missing something, but that's how it looks to me. Unless your
    local affiliate stations are allowed and decide to air them. It sucks, yes. You
    are allowed to be pissed at the Cubs, but you should be just as pissed (or more)
    at MLB for taking away the teams' rights to stream their content.

    I live in Bloomington, IN, which is 4+ hours from Chicago, and I cannot watch the Cubs!

    MLB.com puts me in the Blackout zone.

    Comcast doesn't even let me pay extra to get COMCAST Sports Net! You'd think that was possible since "Comcast" is in the name. NOPE.&nbsp;

    Dish won't work because I live in a very wooded area and the signal is crap.&nbsp;

    I'm literally in the middle of a crap sandwich. Too far, yet too close.

<p>I'll start by pointing out that if you live in the Chicago broadcast area much of this won't apply to you. Where you watch games on TV will likely change, but your ability to watch games will not.</p>
<p>As for Cubs fans outside of Chicago, your ability to watch games from 2015 through 2019 will definitely be more limited. This week the Cubs announced<a href="/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8.35.04-AM.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10654" src="/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-13-at-8.35.04-AM-300x169.png" alt="WLS broadcast area" width="300" height="169" data-id="10654" /></a> a five year deal with WLS-TV/ABC-7 to broadcast 25 games per year. Those games will only be available if you live within the over-the-air reception area of WLS or if WLS is offered on your cable or satellite provider as a local channel. This image from <a title="TVFool" href="http://www.tvfool.com/" target="_blank">tvfool.com</a> will give you a pretty good idea if you will be able to get WLS over-the-air and how big your antenna might need to be.</p>
<p>Comcast SportsNet will continue to air 80 regular season games. That leaves 57 games still on the table. The speculation is that the Cubs will work out a deal with WGN-9 (not Superstation) to air them locally. Those games would also be unavailable to people living outside the WGN-9 local viewing area.</p>
<p>And the elephant in the room, MLB.tv. We've discussed on multiple occasions the absurdity of blocking content from people who have paid for that content, but it's the world we live in with streaming rights controlled by MLB Advanced Media and mega TV contracts requiring exclusivity. The Cubs cannot just decide to make streaming available to those fans outside the local viewing area. It's not their call.</p>
<p>There are ways around the blackout. I won't detail them here as I'm not really clear on the legality of it all. You can Google it and explore them at your own risk. But that illustrates the point pretty well. Fans are so interested in watching games they are willing to enter into questionable legal territory to get around the blackout because it is the only option available to see these games. Assign a dollar value to that, MLB. Let the market decide what you're worth rather than an inflated cost based on artificial scarcity.</p>
<p>So, here are your options if you live outside of the Chicagoland area, but within the MLB.tv blackout area. Assuming you're not willing to just listen to the radio broadcast. I can't think of any others. Leave comments if you know of more.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move to Chicago.</li>
<li>Get MLB.tv and find away around the blackout.</li>
<li>Wait for the dust to settle on these deals and the details come out. Then call or email your local ABC and/or WGN/CW affiliate and ask them if they are able or plan to air these games. Let them know how much you want to see them. I don't know if this will even be an option for them, but it's worth a shot.</li><br />
</ol><br />
My overall assessment is that these issues will get resolved sooner or later. This is all part of the growing pains of a traditional medium being overhauled because of pressure from new media. MLB teams are not "local" brands that fit nicely into "markets". They are billion dollar, internationally recognized brands. Delivering your content like it's 1985 is not going to sustain an aging fan base or grow that base with the next generation. It's just unfortunate for Cubs fans outside of Chicago that these growing pains have to happen during what could be the most exciting five year stretch in Cubs history.</p>
