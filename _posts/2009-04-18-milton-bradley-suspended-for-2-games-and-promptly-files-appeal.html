  content: "Dude, 'robotic' is not the preferred nomenclature. 'Japanese', please.
    \r\n\r\nBut the robot is not the issue here. He yelled at MY FUCKING UMP.\r\n\r\nBut
    seriously, I think I'd be pretty mad at those calls. Still, you have to be a little
    more professional at this level. Earlier this season one of the Cubs' catchers
    threw a fit after an ump called a player safe at the plate.   The guy was CLEARLY
    safe. It just pissed me off to see the catcher being such a cry baby, especially
    so early on in the season."

<p>Milton Bradley lived up to his reputation in his first at-bat at Wrigley Field on Thursday.&nbsp; Two questionable calls in his at-bat led to an argument with home plate umpire, Larry Vanover.&nbsp; I was unable to watch the game and had to rely on MLB Gameday on my work computer.&nbsp; I was pretty baffled when I opened it up and saw that Milton Bradley had been ejected, considering he was injured.&nbsp; All I could picture was Bradley coming out of the dugout to argue with an ump.&nbsp; After I did a little research, I realized he had actually taken an at-bat.</p>
<p>Since I did not see the full situation, I can't speak with great authority.&nbsp; I saw the pitches on tape and they were obviously questionable.&nbsp; I understand Bradley's ejection given baseball's rule that you can't argue balls and strikes.&nbsp; However, Bradley's suspension and undisclosed fine seems pretty ridiculous to me.&nbsp; Apparently, Bradley made contact with Vanover.&nbsp; Granted the camera angle is not great, but <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090418&amp;content_id=4326834&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb">it sure doesn't look to me like Bradley made contact with him</a>.</p>
<p>I was actually impressed that Bradley walked away as soon as he did considering everything we've heard about his temperament.&nbsp; It appeared as though he had some thing to say, said it and walked away.&nbsp; This situation does not trouble me.&nbsp; Those were pretty questionable calls and I think any player except the robotic Fukudome would have had some sort of reaction.&nbsp; Bradley looked like a guy that wanted to come through for his team and didn't feel like he got a fair opportunity to do that.&nbsp; For his sake, I hope most Cubs fans appreciate his fire for his team in this situation and don't pile on him.</p>
