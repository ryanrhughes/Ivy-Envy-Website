<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt connect via Skype for this episode.  We talk about the Reds series, Darwin Barney's crowning of the NL Rookie of the Month, Castro's slump and Pena's departure from his slump.  We compare Darwin Barney to Ryan Theriot and this gives Kurt an opportunity to express how much he dislikes Theriot.  </p>
<p>Benjamin from Streamwood, IL chimes in with a few topics for us.  He asks us if we think Casey Coleman is good or not and how we feel about Keith Moreland as the new voice on the radio broadcasts.  We also read your entries from the weekly photo caption contest.  </p>
