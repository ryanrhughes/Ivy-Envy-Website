<p>Our Iowa Cubs Game Meet-up is this upcoming Saturday.  If you'd like to meet up with us for beers before the game and join us in the suite for the game, check out the details at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/iowa" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/Iowa</a>.  Also, the following Saturday (May 31st) is the Wasting Away in Wrigleyville Pub Crawl.  If you'd like to join us for a tour of Wrigley Field and hit 9 bars in 9 innings, you can find the details at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wrigleyville" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/Wrigleyville</a>.</p>
<p>The Cubs minor league system has another no-hitter, this time from Kane County.  Jorge Soler suffers another injury and we talk about his injury struggles.  Edwin Jackson has put together a nice little string of starts.  Kris Bryant continues to tear it up at AA Tennessee and we discuss the timing of his promotion to AAA Iowa.  </p>
<p>We also look at the Cubs run differential in 2014.  It indicates the Cubs should be very close to a .500 team, yet they are far from it.  So what's the reason for this and can we expect things to level out over the course of the season.  </p>
<p>We answer listener questions, one of which leads into Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week.  After the break, we read a few Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>We would really appreciate it if you would take 5 minutes to fill out <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/survey" target="_blank">this listener survey</a>.<br />
