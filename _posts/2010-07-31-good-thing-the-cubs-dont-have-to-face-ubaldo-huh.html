<p>The fact that the Cubs will not have to face Ubaldo Jimenez in this series in Denver does not really matter.  When your pitching staff gives up 17 runs on 21 hits, it doesn't really matter who you are facing.  You're not going to win that game.  I was thinking that the Cubs will have gotten through both series in 2010 with the Rockies without facing Jimenez.  That's good for the Cubs, I guess.  But really, it's quite clear 2010 is over for this club and I wouldn't have minded watching one of the best young pitchers in MLB.</p>

<p>Jimenez hasn't been great lately, though.  In his last 7 outings, he's given up a lot of earned runs.  He's given up 7, two games of 6, and two games of 4 earned runs.  His ERA is at 2.67, which is low, but after having an ERA of under 1.00 for the first two months of the season, it appears batters are maybe getting more comfortable with his pitching.  His control is slipping, too.  In his second most recent outing, he lasted 2 innings and gave up 6 runs on 3 hits and 6 walks.</p>
<p>If a 3-3, 4.56 Jeff Francis can handcuff the Cubs and hold them to four hits and then hand it over to the bullpen, which didn't allow a hit, I would imagine the Cubs could have given the 16-2 Ubaldo Jimenez a perfect opportunity to get back on track and probably throw a 1-hitter.</p>
