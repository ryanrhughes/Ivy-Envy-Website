  content: They talked about the Yankees a lot during the broadcast.  In fact, when
    Derek Lee, one of baseball's most exciting hitters was up to bat, they were droning
    on and on about the Yankees.

<p>I swear at the beginning of the season, I heard that they Cubs were not going to use those alternate home jerseys. &nbsp;I believe in the past, it has been up to the starting pitcher&nbsp;if the team wears&nbsp;pinstripes or the blues.</p>
<p>I cannot express how much I hate these blue jerseys. I think they look stupid against the blue pinstriped pants. Plus, they look like slow-pitch softball beer league jerseys. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-28"></a>The Cubs are an historic franchise and I think traditional jerseys are classy and are a good exhibit of that history.</p>
<p>It's fairly shocking to me to see ESPN broadcast games two nights in a row, and neither are Red Sox or Yankee games. How many times tonight do you think they will mention the Red Sox, the Yankees or the American League East?</p>
