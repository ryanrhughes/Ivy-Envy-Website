<p>The fact that it's taken us a few days to write about Mike Quade's firing shows you how stunned we were with the move. &nbsp;Ok, the truth is, it was so expected that we almost didn't even acknowledge it. &nbsp; While the players on the team lobbied for him to be hired as manager after serving as interim manager at the end of the 2010 season, it appeared that Quade fell out of the good graces of those same players in the second half of the 2011 season. &nbsp;As we have been discussing on&nbsp;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ivy-envy/id306933992" target="_blank">the podcast</a>, we didn't see any way that Quade survived the off-season to manage the team in 2012.</p>
<p>When he was hired as the interim manager, Quade was a nice change from Lou Piniella. &nbsp;Lou had some of the most un-informative press conferences, and Quade replaced Lou's "uh's" and stuttering/stammering with some real information that appeared to be sincere and honest. &nbsp;He came off as an "Average Joe" in his early press conferences and that was a welcome change, not just with the Cubs, but in sports as a whole.</p>
<p>The fact that Quade was given a 2-year contract told us that his time with the Cubs would be short. &nbsp;While many fans (myself NOT included) thought that the Cubs should hire Ryne Sandberg rather than Mike Quade, I think it's pretty clear that no manager could succeed in the situation. &nbsp;Mike Quade was the sacrificial lamb and filled the role nicely. &nbsp;At the same time, it seemed he did very little to shed that designation.</p>
<p>Though Quade has coached and managed young players since the mid-1980's, we saw a Cubs team that was the worst in baseball in defense and fundamentals. &nbsp;Because there was no noticeable improvement, I think it was very unlikely that Quade would have kept his job with a completely new front office that surely would rather move forward with a manager they choose, rather than stick with a poor performer put in place by Jim Hendry that has one year left on his contract.</p>
<p>I don't think you can hold much against Quade. &nbsp;While he didn't do much to improve the Cubs, he was in over his head. &nbsp;It's easy for the armchair managers to second-guess calls, it is obviously more difficult to manage a Major League Baseball team, especially this team with it's clubhouse issues.</p>
<p>It's a move we all knew would happen. &nbsp;The Cubs are on a roll here in the last few weeks with hires, let's see if they can keep it up.</p>
