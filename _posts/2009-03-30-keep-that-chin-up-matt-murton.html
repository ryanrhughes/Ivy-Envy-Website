<p>My favorite ex-Cub, Matt Murton was dealt a heavy blow this evening as the <a href="http://colorado.rockies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090330&amp;content_id=4090494&amp;vkey=news_col&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=col">Colorado Rockies optioned him</a> to Triple A Colorado Springs.&nbsp; That's pretty surprising considering Murton was hitting .302 with 2 HR's in Spring Training.&nbsp; Ex-White Sox Scott Podsednik and his .217 still has a spot on the roster, though.</p>
<p>Hang in there, my fellow pelo rojo.</p>
