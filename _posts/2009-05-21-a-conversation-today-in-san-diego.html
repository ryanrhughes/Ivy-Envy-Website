<p><strong>Padres</strong> - "Good news, Jake.&nbsp; We've worked out a trade and you're going to Chicago."</p>
<p><strong>Peavy</strong> - "Oh, that's great to hear.&nbsp; I'm really glad it's worked out.&nbsp; I'd say I've waited long enough."</p>
<p><strong>Padres</strong> - "Yeah.&nbsp; Word has it that folks on the South Side are happy to have you on board."</p>
<p><strong>Peavy</strong> - "Southside?"</p>
<p><strong>Padres</strong> - "Yeah...the White Sox."</p>
<p><strong>Peavy</strong> - "Wait, Chicago has two baseball teams?"</p>
