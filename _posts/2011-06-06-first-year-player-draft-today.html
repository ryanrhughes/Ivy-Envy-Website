  content: "I never said he would be there for sure.  I was just thinking about his
    situation and that it was an interesting one for a kid to be in.  \r\n\r\nI'd
    rather see him in Red.  Football prospects seem to pan out more often than baseball
    prospects.  Do you guys think that's true?"

  content: "Very interesting situation.  If you can sign that high and get a big paycheck
    and play in a sport where you (likely) won't suffer brain damage or other injuries
    that impact your well-being for the rest of your life, why wouldn't you play baseball?\r\n\r\nDid
    Nebraska put all their eggs in one basket in recruiting him this year?  I know
    ND was going after him pretty hard and they were the front-runners for a while.
    \ It could really mess with a football program to have a huge recruit bail to
    play baseball."

  content: They have this other QB commit, Jamal Turner, who is pretty highly regarded.  Hopefully
    that pans out for them if Starling opts for baseball.

<p style="text-align: center;">Bubba Starling</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The 2011 First-Year Player Draft is upon us, and the only thing that cheers me up about the Cubs right now is looking to the future.&nbsp; We have some young players giving us some hope for the years to come, and we hope that the Cubs will secure more talent in today's draft.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I believe that I've mentioned that I'm a big Nebraska football fan on the podcast before, and one of their best commits for this year's recruiting class is Bubba Starling.&nbsp; He is a four-star quarterback prospect from Kansas.&nbsp; The problem is that he can also throw a fastball in the mid-nineties and play center field very well.&nbsp; What a curse to be blessed with such athletic prowess!&nbsp; Unfortunately for Husker fans, it has been noted by several sources that Starling is <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110602&amp;content_id=19935050&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">on the Cubs' radar</a> as a potential draft pick.&nbsp; This situation has happened to Nebraska before.&nbsp; In 1999, Carl Crawford committed to play quarterback for Nebraska, and he ended up choosing baseball when he was drafted early.&nbsp; I'd say that turned out pretty well for him.&nbsp; It's looking like Starling would be offered a multi-million dollar deal once he is drafted.&nbsp; Could you blame a kid for <a href="http://espn.go.com/ncf/recruiting/hot?id=6563505" target="_blank">choosing the money over the uncertainty of making through a college football career</a> unscathed?</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Corey will be familiar with this type of situation as he followed the exploits of Jeff Samardzija with Notre Dame.&nbsp; Samardzija was offered a 10-million dollar contract with the Cubs.&nbsp; He decided to leave football behind and was quoted as saying, "Baseball is my first love." Though it has looked at times this year like Samardzija is getting on-track, I don't know how much love baseball has left for him.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Tim Lincecum is a player we wish would've chosen baseball right out of high school.&nbsp; He was originally drafted by the Cubs in the 48th round of the 2003 draft, but since he was drafted so late, there was no financial incentive to choose pro baseball over college.&nbsp; The choice was a clear one for him.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">At any rate, I'm hoping the Cubs get some good pitching and maybe some players who can hit for power in today's draft, and hopefully they make the right decisions.</p></p>
