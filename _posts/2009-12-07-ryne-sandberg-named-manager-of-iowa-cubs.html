  content: "I've heard Allan Trammell's name dropped in articles. It would be short
    lived because he's probably the next Tiger manager after Jim Leyland since he
    is their Ryno. A year or two of Trammell would give Ryno a little more time in
    Iowa.\r\n\r\nAs for Girardi. Check out this article.\r\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/columns/story?columnist=greenberg_jon&id=4617874"

  content: Let me throw another scenario out there that might be a little more likely.  Ryne
    Sandberg or Bob Brenly?

  content: "hey there, long time reader, first time caller! :-)\r\n\r\ni would probably
    prefer girardi because of the big league experience. i thought he was a better
    fit than piniella was but have been pleasantly surprised by sweet lou. but girardi's
    success in florida and new york would make him the best choice. \r\n\r\nhowever,
    having missed out on that boat, i think sandberg might be the better choice long
    term. with it being his first big league gig, if he is able to be successful,
    it might be the type of hiring that could last for a decade or more. with girardi
    already an established coach, this would be his 3rd stop and i wouldn't see him
    having any more dedication to the cubs job than anyone else.\r\n\r\nwith the cubs
    finally getting away from the tribune company, hopefully they can really set up
    a true winning environment and have sanberg be the long term coach. that would
    be the kind of stability and success the franchise needs."

  content: I agree with you, Robbie.  Although I wouldn't cry myself to sleep if Girardi
    was hired either.

<p>Though the only news I'd really like to hear from the Cubs right now would be a trade sending Milton Bradley out of town, I was happy to hear that <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091207&amp;content_id=7769154&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">Ryne Sandberg will be managing the Iowa Cubs</a> next year.&nbsp; Des Moines is only about 2 1/2 hours from Ivy Envy headquarters and I expect to make at least a few trips to watch the Iowa Cubs play.</p>
<p>After moving up a class in the minor league system every year, it would appear as though the Cubs are grooming Sandberg to take over for Piniella at the end of this year.&nbsp; However, it seems like at least a <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091206&amp;content_id=7764236&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">possibility that Piniella will return to the Cubs after his current contract expires</a>.</p>
<p>So, those of you that have not been able to pry yourself away from the Cubs and are out wandering the Cubs blogosphere, let me pose a question to you.&nbsp; It's completely hypothetical, but I'm interested to hear what you people think.&nbsp; Or I'm at least curious if anyone is reading about the Cubs in December.&nbsp; Would you rather have Ryne Sandberg or Joe Girardi managing the Cubs in 2011?</p>
