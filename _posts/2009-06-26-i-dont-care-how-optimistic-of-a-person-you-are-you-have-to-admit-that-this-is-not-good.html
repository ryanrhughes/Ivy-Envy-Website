  is not good.

  content: I'm optimistic.. but not that much corey.  Obviously, this team has problems.  There
    are a few positions where the Cubs need to really pick it up.. Cubs second basemen
    this year are batting .211 with 2 home runs.  I've heard grumblings about the
    Cubbies picking up DeRosa.. That'd be a huge pick me up from a really terrible
    Cleveland team.  Milton Bradley needs to start earning his paycheck, and the Cubs
    seriously need to start hitting with runners in scoring position.. Right now,
    they're last in the majors.  That's ridiculous.  To be fair to the Cubs, Aramis
    Ramirez is returning soon.. And he should really be able to help the lineup out.  To
    date, they haven't done much to make me think they're a team ready to go far..
    but with Aramis returning to protect the other big bats, I expect Milton to do
    better and Lee to continue his hot streak.  Lets remember, the Cubs only sit 3
    1/2 games out.  This isn't the end of the world.. They've managed to tread
    water while Aramis has been gone.. not too surprising.  When he was hurt, did
    you expect the Cubs to go on a tear? Lets at least give them a little credit..
    pitching has been great, offense has struggled.. kind of what we thought would
    happen.. well, it's what I thought would happen.

  content: "You thought the offense would struggle this year?  I really find that
    hard to believe, seeing as how you are the most optimistic Cubs fan I know.\r\n\r\nYou
    know...this is the kind of line-up that you shouldn't have to worry too much when
    a big, possibly the biggest, bat goes down to injury.  If you look at Soriano,
    Lee and Bradley...just those three, I think the team should be able to do more
    than tread water when Ramirez was injured.  Those are three huge bats, but there
    are still guys like Soto, Fontenot and Fukudome that are the caliber of hitters
    that would normally be expected to hold things together if a big guy gets injured
    on Cubs teams of the past or a lot of teams in the MLB right now.  \r\n\r\nSo
    what I'm saying is that if one guy goes down, even if he is the most clutch, this
    team is built to continue to win.  That didn't happen and I'm not sure everything
    would have been hunky dory if Ramirez would not have gotten injured."

<p>This last series against the Tigers indicates that my last post, "<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1019">Cubs return to form in Atlanta</a>", was pretty accurate.&nbsp; I missed the entire series, driving to California.&nbsp; Part of me is not sure if I want to even look at the game summaries.&nbsp; Andy kept me updated through text that the Cubs had continued on their losing ways.&nbsp; I said that I felt the Cubs needed to go 8-5 in these two weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you look at the 8-5, you realize those are not high expectations.&nbsp; If you look at the way the Cubs are playing, those are unrealistic expectations.&nbsp; This team is 9-11 in the month of June.&nbsp; I'm officially declaring it "June Swoon".</p>
<p>I don't care how optimistic you are.&nbsp; Even Tim, the guy who can look at a 62-100 Cubs team and claim they are the best team in baseball has to admit that this is not looking good.&nbsp; I'm not saying the season is a wash, but seriously, has this 2009 club shown you anything ?&nbsp; Is there one sign that things will definitely turn around?</p>
