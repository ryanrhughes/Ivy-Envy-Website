<p>Because of my move out of the Quad Cities, we've had to change how we do our live broadcasts.  We're now using the Google+ Hangout broadcast program.  This has some advantages and disadvantages.  The main advantage is that it allows all of us to be on camera from our different locations.  Another perk to using Google+ is that it archives the broadcasts on the <a href="http://youtube.com/relentlesspodcasts" target="_blank">Relentless Podcast Network YouTube Channel</a>.  </p>
<p>What I don't like about it is that it's not as smooth of a broadcast in regards to video and audio.  The YouTube video seems very compressed, so that really impacts the sound quality.  You will notice a huge difference between the podcast version you hear via our site, iTunes, Stitcher, Pocketcasts, etc. and what you'll see on the video feed.  It also doesn't have a built in chat forum for listeners.  </p>
<p>For better or for worse, this is what we'll be using for the time being.  If you weren't able to watch the broadcast live, here's our first real broadcast using the new set-up.  </p>
