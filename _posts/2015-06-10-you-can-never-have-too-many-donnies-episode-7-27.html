<p>The Cubs signed free agent reliever, Rafael Soriano.  We discuss the terms of this deal, why Soriano was still an available free agent and how we might see the Cubs use him this season.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have made their selections in the 2015 draft.  We talk about their first few picks and then comment on the overall strategy the Cubs took with the 2015 MLB draft.  </p>
<p>Jacob Turner starts his rehab stint in an attempt to return to the Cubs 25-man roster.  This gives us the opportunity to discuss his future with the Cubs and where he might fit in with this 2015 team.  </p>
<p>We have a few listener emails, including a discussion on David Ross, concern over Jon Lester, the Cubs playing up/down to their competition and a new team stat that heavily favors the Cubs.  </p>
