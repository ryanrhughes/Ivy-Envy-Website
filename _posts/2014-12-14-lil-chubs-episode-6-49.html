    Peoria ABC affiliate to see if they have intention of helping us downstaters out.

  content: Here's what might be a stupid question...  Comcast has 80 games, ABC-7
    has 25, who has the other 57?  Is that still up in the air?

  content: It appears that those will go to WGN-9.  Not the Superstation but the local
    WGN in Chicago.

  content: Wow.  So if we play by the rules downstate, it's actually impossible for
    us to see more than half the games.  Thanks MLB.

  content: The way it stands right now, yes.  It's early and I think the games will
    be picked up by local affiliates.  Hopefully, we'll learn more about those chances
    soon.

A lot of Cubs fans have some confusion about these changes. We attempt to explain why these changes are happening and simply, how will we watch the Cubs next year.</p>
<p>There are quite a few players from the Cubs system that are playing in the winter leagues. Andy runs through some of the more notable names and then we discuss the purpose of their involvement in the leagues and what we'd like to see as far as development goes from these players.</p>
<p>We talk about the changes in the Wrigley renovations. One of the seven signs has been removed from the plans and there have been adjustments to other signs. The reason for these changes is to preserve federal tax credits through a National Register of Historic Places designation through the National Park Services.</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions and read some internet muscle flexes.</p>
<p>Thanks to Danny Rockett for letting us play "Lesterday" at the end of the episode.</p>
