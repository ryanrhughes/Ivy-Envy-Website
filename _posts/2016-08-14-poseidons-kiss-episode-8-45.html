We had a blast hanging out with listeners this weekend and we share a few stories.  </p>
<p>Because of Saturday's game and Pedro Strop's injury earlier in the week, we talk a fair amount about the bullpen. We also discuss this Cubs/Cardinals series.</p>
<p>Kurt has a Scary Stat of the Week and we have a few Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
