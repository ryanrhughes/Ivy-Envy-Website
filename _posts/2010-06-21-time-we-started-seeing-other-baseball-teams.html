<p>Yesterday, the Cubs lost 12-0 to the Angels.&nbsp; The loss was so demoralizing that it had someone I know (whose name starts with "C" and ends with "orey") threatening to end his lifelong dedication to the Cubs.&nbsp; Saturday evening, I went over to his house, and with a crazed look in his eye, he placed an Angels cap on my head.&nbsp; Needless to say, we're going to address this momentary lapse of judgment in our next podcast.</p>
<p>One thing we can say for sure is that the Cubs' defense has been an absolute joke this season.&nbsp; Carrie Muskat wrote yesterday that this season the Cubs have "given up 44 unearned runs, tops in the Major Leagues, and have committed 11 errors in the past five games."&nbsp; Put some circus music behind Cubs' game footage and you have a bloopers reel to rival anything you could get free with a subscription to <em>Sports Illustrated</em>.&nbsp; But is it time to give up on the Cubs yet?&nbsp; Allow me to quote one of Corey's favorite college football commentators and say, "Not so fast, my friend."</p>
<p>Today, the Cubs defeated the Angels 12-1.&nbsp; Granted, they were facing probably the weakest pitcher in the Angels' rotation, but it was still quite a retort to yesterday's piss-poor showing.&nbsp; Ivy Envy writer Ryan called the team "bipolar" in a text to me today, and he is right; though <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=174" target="_blank">this has been an issue</a> going back even to the first year of this site, it has been even worse in 2009 &amp; 2010.&nbsp; The "ups" have been brief, and the "downs" have been sustained for longer and longer periods of time.&nbsp; Consistency of excellent play will be the attribute that will help the Cubs finally break through and win a championship.&nbsp; That looks like it won't happen this season or perhaps not even in the near future.&nbsp; I'm still not giving up on the Cubs this season, and I certainly will never think of stepping out on the Cubs, no matter how bleak it gets.&nbsp; Is that pathetic?&nbsp; Stay tuned for further discussion on this issue.</p>
