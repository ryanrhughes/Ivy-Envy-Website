<p>I received an e-mail from a reader, and I'd like to share the contents.&nbsp; This person is an elementary school teacher that has a few little Cubs fans in her class.&nbsp; Apparently, Children's Poetry Day is March 21st, and the class has been working on different types of poems.</p>
<p>Now, the extent of my knowledge of poetry begins and ends with the Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/thecubsinhaiku" target="_blank">@TheCubsInHaiku</a>.&nbsp; If you have Twitter, you need to be following them.&nbsp; So I'm impressed when a third-grader decides to write a Cinquain.&nbsp; This poem was written by Chloe, a third-grader.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Cubs<br />
Blue Red<br />
Run Jump Wave<br />
Happy Excited Mad Sad<br />
Chicago</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">She also shared with me an excerpt from an article entitled, "Persistence in Sports" by a boy named Cole.</p></p>
<blockquote>
<div>The baseball team, the  Cubs, never give up even though they lose all the time. They haven't won  the World Series in 102 years but they never give up! Cubs fans need to  be persistent too. Getting to the World Series could take a while.</div></blockquote><br />
It's interesting that the sense of doom has already permeated these kids' sense of what it is to be a Cubs fan.  Third grade was about the time that my grandfather handed down the love of the Cubs to me.  I think I was pretty optimistic about the Cubs until I saw things fall apart against the Giants in the 1989 playoffs.   These kids seem able to identify and embrace what it means to be an average loyal fan to the Cubs.  I hope that if I don't get to see the Cubs win the World Series (ridiculous thing to say, but quite possible), these kids do it in the roughly 25 years they'll spend with the Cubs after I am gone.</p>
