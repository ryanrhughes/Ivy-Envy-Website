  content: The extra year of team control will be even more important with Bryant.
    No Chicago until next year. He's under Scott Boras and Scott Boras does NOT do
    lock them in early for a discount deals.

<p>Recently on the podcast, we discussed that Bryant had only been in Double-A Tennessee for two months and in the words of Ian Stewart, the Cubs were not letting Kris Bryant "rott" in Double-A. I think the Cubs wanted to give Bryant the All-Star experience.  </p>
<p>If the Cubs were waiting for Kris Bryant to struggle in Double-A, I don't think it was going to happen.  Bryant hit .355/.458/.702 with 22 home runs and was crowned the Southern League's Home Run Derby winner.  </p>
<p>One thing that makes this promotion interesting is where players are plugged in defensively.  Christian Villanueva is the Cubs #11 prospect (<a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/prospects/watch/y2014/index.jsp?c_id=chc#list=chc" target="_blank">according to MLB.com)</a> and has the best defensive skills of the potential candidates to occupy 3<sup>rd</sup> base for the Cubs in the future.  </p>
<p>It's possible that Bryant could end up in a corner outfield spot.  I'm guessing the Cubs would rather take at-bats from Josh Vitters in LF rather than from Villanueva at 3<sup>rd</sup> base.  What is a given is that Bryant will get his at-bats.  The Cubs did not call him up to platoon with another player.  </p>
<p>In many ways a move in the next week or so was completely predictable.  On the other hand, I think a promotion right now has the potential to lead to a sticky situation later this season.  I don't think the Cubs had any intention of calling up Kris Bryant to the big league team this season.  I think they'd much prefer to wait until after the Super-Two Status cut-off next season.  If you don't understand what the Super-Two Status is or why the Cubs would benefit from waiting to call up Kris Bryant, or any other prospect after this cut-off, read the piece I wrote on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/javier-baez-super-two-status/" target="_blank">Javier Baez and Super-Two Status</a>. </p>
<p>The Bryant promotion is exciting for Cubs fans, though.  The top two prospects in the system are at the top level of the minor leagues.  My hope is that Bryant is forced to develop a lot at Triple-A, similar to the development that Javier Baez is going through.  It's best for the organization, and us fans, if the players can be challenged at some point in the minors.  I think it'd be safe to say that Kris Bryant has probably never struggled at any level.  I'd rather him learn how to work through things and make adjustments in AAA rather than experiencing those things for the first time with MLB pitching.  </p>
<p>The Iowa Cubs should have no problems bringing in fans with Javier Baez and Kris Bryant both on the roster.  If things go as planned, 2015 could be a really interesting season in this rebuilding process with potentially some big steps forward.  </p>
