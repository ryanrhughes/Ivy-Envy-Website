<p>Andy and Corey look at vastly improved statistical categories for the Cubs and consider whether we should be encouraged by these numbers.  We discuss more of the changes this team is experiencing, mainly transforming from a home run reliant team to a small-ball team that is aggressive on the base-paths.  </p>
<p>While the offensive and defensive numbers are improved, the pitching staff is struggling early in Spring Training.  We look at the bright spots on the pitching staff and then look at the one major pitching concern - Carlos Marmol.  After the 2nd half of 2011 and what we've seen this Spring, it's safe to wonder if we will ever see Carlos Marmol return to his dominant production.</p>
<p>Then we get Joe Martin on the phone from Mesa.  Joe spent all day Tuesday at the minor league camp and tells us what he saw.  He also spent about 30 minutes with Gerardo Concepcion.  The write-up of that conversation will be coming on Wednesday.  </p>
