  content: That was the overstatement of the century, but Gonzalez is really good.
    Or is he just really good against the Cubs? Three home runs and all 6 RBI. Let's
    see how they pitch to him today.

<p>From last night's game after Adrian Gonzales hit his third homerun in two games against the Cubs.</p></p>
<p>"He is Albert Pujols, Barry Bonds, Chipper Jones all rolled into one."</p></p>
<p>I would like to revisit this quote in 20 years to see how true it is.</p></p>
