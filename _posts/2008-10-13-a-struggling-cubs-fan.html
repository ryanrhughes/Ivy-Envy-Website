<span lang="EN">So where do we go from here? Forget the Cubs, I&rsquo;m not talking about them. We have the next four or five months to over-analyze the roster changes and line-up adjustments. This time right now, this is our time. We Cubs fans deserve a good amount of time to forget analyzing this team and focus on ourselves. We got screwed over. Don&rsquo;t tell me we aren&rsquo;t owed anything. Look at what we&rsquo;ve suffered through. If there is such a thing as fans that deserve a championship, it&rsquo;s us.</span></p>
<p>I have gone through the gamut of emotions. For a very brief period of time, I decided I was done with the Cubs. I couldn&rsquo;t take the heartbreak anymore. I can&rsquo;t accurately say how long this lasted. It may have been <a id="more"></a><a id="more-270"></a>minutes, it may have been a day. It&rsquo;s all pretty foggy.</p>
<p>My wife, Tawny, helped me get from that stage to the next. I was explaining to her (probably close to tears) that I was done with them. They had hurt me for the last time. Nobody deserved this and I needed to just suck it up and walk away. She explained to me that I owed it to my Grandpa to stick with the Cubs. I mention in my first blog on Ivy Envy that he was responsible for initiating my loyalty to the Cubs. He passed away in 1987 and Tawny asked &ldquo;How could you explain to him why you left the Cubs?&rdquo; I had a pretty good idea of how to explain it to him. &ldquo;&hellip;then they spent 136 million dollars on this dude that is hitting .107 in playoff games with the Cubs!&ldquo; But then I realized that he went from 1945 to 1984 without even so much as a playoff game. If he could suffer with zero satisfaction for 39 years, I can stick with a team that has been to the playoffs four times in the last ten years, right?</p>
<p>So then I decided that I was going to stick with the Cubs, but I would keep my distance. I wasn&rsquo;t going to give them my heart again. They couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. I wouldn&rsquo;t follow them on a daily basis and allow my moods to be controlled by Aramis Ramirez&rsquo;s pop fouls, Alfonso Soriano&rsquo;s maddening streakiness, and Derek Lee&rsquo;s double plays. I wouldn&rsquo;t get excited about a great outing by Zambrano or clutch at-bats by Ryan Theriot, Reed Johnson or Mike Fontenot. I might check the box scores and standings to see how they are doing, but that&rsquo;s it. I wouldn&rsquo;t give them any of my money, that&rsquo;s for sure. I&rsquo;ve got a few shirts and hats. It&rsquo;s amazing how long clothing will last you as an adult. When I was a kid, hats would last me a year, tops. But as an adult, my shirts should last me 8 or 10 years and my hat should last me 3 years. I&rsquo;m sure as hell not giving them any money to go see them play. After all, it&rsquo;s such a headache to go to games up there. Parking sucks and tickets are ridiculously overpriced. I can only assume that with the ownership changes and recent &ldquo;success&rdquo;, ticket prices will go up. It makes so much sense. I&rsquo;m not turning my back on the Cubs. I&rsquo;m just not giving them such priority.</p>
<p>But there is one thing I did not take into account. I realized after the Cubs collapsed that you can&rsquo;t rationalize feelings. When you are in a relationship, you can&rsquo;t adequately describe why you love the one you&rsquo;re with. You can try to explain why you love the one you&rsquo;re with, but your case won&rsquo;t be strong enough for me or anyone else to understand to the degree that I would feel the same about that person. So it&rsquo;s just something you have and you usually have very little control over those feelings. You can&rsquo;t turn them off. And I can&rsquo;t turn off my loyalty to the Cubs. My brain can come up with a laundry list of reasons that I shouldn&rsquo;t love the Cubs, but my heart won&rsquo;t allow me to fully separate. Yes, they hurt me and it might take some time to get over this. But I can pretty much guarantee that by next April, the hope of a winning season and a World Series ring will fill the holes in my heart that the 2008 Cubs left.</p>
<p>I fully realized that I couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;quit&rdquo; the Cubs, or probably even create a little distance between myself and the Cubs today. I was at a Salvation Army, sorting through other people&rsquo;s junk with my little girls. I was browsing through the t-shirts and found a Zambrano shirt and a Ramirez shirt. They are in great shape and I snagged them instantly, immediately trying to rank these two shirts (3 bucks apiece) in my thrift shop finds of the year rankings. It was at this point, as I am practically giddy with satisfaction with my find that I realize my heart hasn&rsquo;t quit the Cubs. I stood there for a few seconds to contemplate this situation. These shirts are nearly new. Someone bought these this year. Someone quit the Cubs and destroyed the evidence. Now I&rsquo;m not one that buys into all of the ruckus about a curse. But walking out of that Salvation Army I had to wonder if these t-shirts were, indeed the find of the year, or if I received a hand-me-down curse from someone that has finally managed for their head to keep their heart in check.</p>
