<p>Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer made their first on-the-field move with the Cubs this week, signing free agent outfielder David DeJesus.  The 32 year-old outfielder was with the Kansas City Royals until 2011, which he spent with the Oakland A's.  </p>
<p>DeJesus has been very solid at the plate some years, and very average in other years.  In 2008, the Royals saw DeJesus' batting average jump to .307, up from .260 the previous year.  2011 was DeJesus' weakest hitting season.  He batted .240 (nearly .080 drop from 2010) with 10 HR, 46 RBI and a .698 OPS.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/9187473-573/matt-garzas-fate-will-signal-cubs-direction.html" target="_blank">DeJesus claims that his surgically repaired hand bothered him in 2011 and he now feels 100%.</a>  His numbers did improve towards the end of the season, which gives some credibility to that claim.  Epstein has had his eye on DeJesus for a while.  He tried to acquire DeJesus at the 2010 trading deadline.  </p>
<p>If his hand was hindering his performance in 2011, the new front office of the Cubs were able to identify a player that they could get at a bit of a discount that could produce decent numbers for the team.  Epstein also sees DeJesus as a step in the right direction in regards to <a href="http://www.nesn.com/2011/12/theo-epstein-gets-to-work-with-cubs-signs-david-dejesus-to-two-year-deal.html" target="_blank">changing the culture of the Cubs</a> and their clubhouse.  </p>
<blockquote><p>The totality of their contributions can be equal to or more than the player who does one thing extremely well -- if a guy is going to hit 25-30 home runs but really hurts you in other areas.  If we have a club full of well-rounded players, we're going to far exceed expectations because the solo contributions really add up.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>DeJesus (and his wife, Kim) have been ecstatic with his signing.  Mrs. DeJesus grew up in the Chicago area and stated that her father had Cubs season tickets.  After the signing was announced, she tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was born a cubs fan, and now im married to one!!!!!! :) COULDNT BE MORE EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!! GOOOOO CUBBIES!!!!!!!!!!</blockquote></p>
<p>The DeJesus' live in the Chicago area and are thrilled to be a part of the organization, so this is one of those feel-good signings, but hopefully DeJesus is able to get back on track and help the Cubs both on the field and in the clubhouse.</p>
