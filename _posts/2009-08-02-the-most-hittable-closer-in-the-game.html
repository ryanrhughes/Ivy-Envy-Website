  content: "I assume this topic will be discussed at great lengths on tonight's podcast.
    \ I don't think BJ Ryan is the answer.  He's got no velocity and is throwing in
    the mid-80's.  \r\n\r\nLet's say the Cubs do get to the playoffs, the back end
    of this bullpen will break our hearts.\r\n\r\nI'm all for Harden in the closer
    role.  I wonder if he'd have trouble going 2 or 3 days in a row, though."

<p>So, Kevin Gregg had back-to-back blown saves this weekend, and tonight's game featured back-to-back homeruns leading to that second blown save.&nbsp; While Saturday's blown save eventually led to much excitement, today's failure just led to a lot of swearing.&nbsp; Some Cubs fans who weren't quite ready to kick Gregg to the curb may be ready to do so now.&nbsp; Corey sent me a text after the game tonight that read, "[Gregg is] the most hittable closer in the game."&nbsp; Our closer now has a 4.17 era and 5 blown saves on the year.&nbsp; Last season with the Marlins, Gregg blew 9 total saves.&nbsp; I figure if he remains the closer, he is on pace to fail several more times than last season.&nbsp; We probably have <em>at least</em> 4 or 5 more to look forward to as Piniella mentioned after the game that he doesn't plan on making a change at closer.&nbsp; In the post-game press conference, Piniella sang his old redundant song, "What are you going to do?"&nbsp; Well Cubs fans have plenty of ideas for what Lou can do.&nbsp; Here is an interesting <a href="http://thundermatt.com/2009/07/chaiming-in.html" target="_blank">one suggesting Harden as closer</a> by Chaim Witz of TMS (this was even posted before this weekend's debacles).&nbsp; The follow-up <a href="http://thundermatt.com/2009/07/cubs-closer-you-make-call.html" target="_blank">post by Ginger Russ</a> is also interesting to consider.&nbsp; Some people might suggest Marmol, but given his own struggles with command this season, he seems doomed to remain a set-up man for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; So, what do you think?&nbsp; Try Guzman?&nbsp; Put B.J. Ryan in there as soon as possible?&nbsp; I don't know.</p>
