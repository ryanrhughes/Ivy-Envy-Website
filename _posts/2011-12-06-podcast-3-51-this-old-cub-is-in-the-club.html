<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss Ron Santo's tardy election into the Hall of Fame.  We also take a look at the winter meetings and the rumors that involve the Cubs, such as Soriano, Pujols and Fielder.  </p>
<p>The Cubs sign David DeJesus and we project what the outfield for the Cubs will look like in 2012.  Mark Riggins is gone and Chris Bosio is the new Cubs pitching coach, and we have virtually no comments on that.  </p>
