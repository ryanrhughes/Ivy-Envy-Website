<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we recap the INCREDIBLE last week in Cubs off-season moves.  </p>
<p>Last week, the Cubs snatched John Lackey away from the Cardinals and this week, the Cubs convinced Jason Heyward to leave St. Louis for less money...and that doesn't sit well with the best fans in baseball.  </p>
<p>The Cubs also signed central Illinois native, Ben Zobrist (for less money than other teams offered).  </p>
<p>The sad news of the week was that these signings were facilitated by the Cubs trading Starlin Castro to the New York Yankees.  We talk reflect on the Starlin-era and share some scary stats and our favorite Castro memories.  </p>
<p>Scott and Andrew from <a href="http://bronxpinstripes.com/" target="_blank">Bronx Pinstripes</a> jump in to talk about Adam Warren.</p>
