<p>I'm watching the Cubs play the Rockies right now, and the Cubs have given up 12 runs here in the 8th inning to make the score 17-2 Rockies.&nbsp; What a freaking joke.&nbsp; I just about reached for the remote to end my misery, and then I thought twice.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'm watching this.&nbsp; It's like my penance for caring too much about this team this season.&nbsp; I'm the monk flagellating himself for his sins right now.&nbsp; The sin of thinking just a week ago that this team could magically turn it around and still make a run.</p>
<p>Old Style is running a radio ad right now emphasizing how their beer has improved so much since they brought back the kraeusening process.&nbsp; In the ad, a guy walks around asking fans how they would "kraeusen" their experience at the ball park that particular day.&nbsp; The answers are all like, "Put sprinklers in the bleachers," and "Have a bottomless container of nachos."&nbsp; Tee-hee.&nbsp; So how would I kraeusen my experience with this ball game?&nbsp; Have the ground open up and swallow the bullpen.</p>
