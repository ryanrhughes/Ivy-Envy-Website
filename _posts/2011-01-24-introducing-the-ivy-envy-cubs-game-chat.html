<p>We are happy to announce that beginning the first game of Spring Training, we will host a game-chat on our site.&nbsp; Are you tired of sending texts to your friends that are Cubs fans during the game?&nbsp; Or do your non-Cubs fan friends get annoyed with the clogging of your Twitter feed with your complaints about Soriano's hustle or Fukudome's corkscrew swing?</p>
<p>Well, now you will be able to join other Cubs fans every game this season in our chat.&nbsp; There won't be a registration required.&nbsp; You won't need to worry about going through a process.&nbsp; It will be easy, and the perfect place for you to share all of your opinions on the Cubs.&nbsp; We know you have them.</p>
<p>The chat will launch Sunday February 27th for the Cubs vs. Oakland game.</p>
