  content: "Dick Vermeil cried when Saddam Hussein got executed.  \r\n\r\nAnyway...I
    have good things to say about anyone who deosn't give up and phone it in once
    their team is clearly out of the running to do anything.  And since Castro needs
    practice fielding I say the more the merrier.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The Cubs have been playing pretty well ever since it stopped mattering, and one young player in particular is still giving 100%--</p>
<p><a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=12160627&amp;topic_id=8878834&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Castro makes a diving catch to get the last out</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I know that the next couple of years have the potential to be rough ones for the Cubs, plays like that one by Castro make me excited to watch this team going forward.</p>
<p>Also, I kind of missed this stuff when it was more relevant, but <em>The Onion</em> has a ton of Lou Piniella-related material right now.&nbsp; Here are some links to the comedy--</p>
