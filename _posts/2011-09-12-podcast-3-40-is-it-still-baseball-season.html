<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy take a look at the teams in the Cubs' minor league system and how they fared in 2011.  We continue to look at the call-ups and consider a starting line-up full of them next season.</p>
<p>We ask ourselves "What went wrong in 2011?".  And we wrap up the show with the photo caption contest.  </p>
