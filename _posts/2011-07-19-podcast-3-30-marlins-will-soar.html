<p>We apologize for the length of this episode.  This might be the most entertaining podcast episode in our 3 seasons of existence.  In the first half of the episode, we talk about the future of Jim Hendry and Mike Quade with the Cubs and the fact that Ryne Sandberg might be positioning himself to become the next manager.  </p>
<p>We also take a look at Carlos Marmol and the closer role.  The trade deadline is coming up quickly and we discuss the idea of Matt Garza and Ryan Dempster being "untouchable".  We come to the realization that there will likely be very few moves made in trades because the players on the roster are either:</p>
<p>1. Unwilling to be traded and leaning on their no-trade clauses.<br />
2. Labeled "untouchable" by the organization.<br />
3. Not worth anything.</p>
<p>The second half of this episode where things get good.  Kurt gives us a killer Scary Stat.  He comes through with his best of the season and one that punches every Cubs fan in the gut.</p>
<p>To end the show, Ryan joins us and we take a look at the song "Marlins Will Soar", written and recorded by Scott Stapp.  If the Marlins can take 3 of 4 from the Cubs at Wrigley this last weekend, then we can have a little fun with this "masterpiece".  </p>
<p>You can find the video here: <a href="http://www.yeahoyeah.com/creedvideo.aspx?id=3157"target="_blank"> Marlins Will Soar</a></p>
<p>Also, at the beginning of the show, I talk about <a href="http://www.markandgracie.com" target="_blank">Mark and Gracie's Tutu Couture</a>.  Check out their site and if you have a little girl that's a Cubs fan, or know some other Cubs fans that have a little girl, check out their Cubs hair-bows.    </p>
