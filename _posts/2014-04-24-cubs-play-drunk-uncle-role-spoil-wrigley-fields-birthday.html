<p>Wrigley Field threw a big birthday party. The Cubs played the role of the drunk uncle. For the first 8 innings, they were dressed in cool new clothes, they were fun, celebratory, handed out gifts to everyone that walked through the doors and life was good. Then they had a few too many, crossed that line and ended up sending everyone home disappointed after pissing all over the birthday cake.</p>
<p>For 23 years, my brother has been a White Sox fan. Over the last few years, he's become uninterested in them enough to decide he's done with them. As I discussed on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/cubs-baseball-reference-podcast-episode-6-10/" target="_blank">this last episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast</a>, Patrick decided that he wanted to go to Wednesday's game and he was prepared to become a Cubs fan. Did he decide the pull the trigger? After spending 14 hours with him, I'm still not sure. I hope to convince Patrick to write a blog post and come on the podcast to discuss his decision.  </p>
<p>Except for, and in spite of the 9th inning, this was a great day and a great experience. Wrigley looked beautiful and there was a slight buzz in Wrigleyville that I haven't felt in a long time. I'm guessing that buzz is gone today.  </p>
