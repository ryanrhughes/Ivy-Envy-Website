<p>Andy, Brian, Corey and Ryan and joined via Skype by Kurt and Jeremy.  This episode is very pitching-heavy with the bullpen being the major focus.  What do the Cubs do with the bullpen?  What do the Cubs do with Marmol?  Was Marmol's injury a little too conveniently timed?  Is it a big deal that Kerry Wood tossed his hat and glove into the stands?  Who is the most "gangsta" Cubs player?  </p>
<p>These are all questions that will be addressed in this episode.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a positive scary stat and we have a lot of entries to pick from in this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
