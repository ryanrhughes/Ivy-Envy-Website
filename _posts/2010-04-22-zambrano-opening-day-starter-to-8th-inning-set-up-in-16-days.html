  content: "I think Cub nation is unnecessarily overwrought about this move, as if
    using Z to shore up the pen for awhile is akin to taking a Corvette offroad. \r\n\r\nTwo
    points:\r\n\r\n1) Middle relief is a huge problem on this club.\r\n\r\nLets survey
    the headlines of our losses thus far after the Opening Day travesty, m'kay?\r\n\r\nBraves
    Rally in Eighth to Take First Two From Cubs\r\nReds Overtake Cubs Late on Stubbs
    Grand Slam\r\nReds Rally Late to Beat Cubs Despite Leake's Seven Walks\r\nBrewers
    Avoid Sweep. . . (Samardzia and Grabow again)\r\n(Offense Fails Against Astros)\r\n(Pagan
    Tie-Breaking Homer in 7th - Russell and Samardiza)\r\n(Shutout by Mets)\r\n(Offense
    held to two runs by Mets)\r\n\r\nPretty easy to see that if the Cubs were a patient
    bleeding out on  a stretcher, two serrated carving knives labeled Grabow and Samardzija
    would be lying nearby in the weeds. Soriano, Soto-Wilkins and Hendry would be
    charged as accessories. \r\n\r\n2) Z is a pretty good pitcher and he can always
    go back to the rotation when the Cubs find a fungible reliever under a rock.\r\n\r\nThis
    move enhances their chances of winning until Silva goes back to being a pumpkin
    and has no downside."

<p>Text message from Paul - April 21st, 12:22pm</p>
<blockquote><p>They should move Carlos to the pen when Lilly comes back.</blockquote></p>
<p>I can't hang with about 3/4 of what Paul says about the Cubs, but he has an incredible track record with this stuff.  Last year, when I hadn't heard a single person say anything about it (and about a week before it happened), Paul predicted that Jake Peavy would go to the White Sox.  </p>
<p>I am not going to state my full opinion on the Zambrano situation in a post.  I'm not in favor, and I'm having trouble organizing my thoughts.  I just can't seem to pull it all together, or even get past "It's so stupid!"  This is not one of those moves that I considered enough to have a fully formed opinion.  </p>
<p>There will be a group of us Ivy Envy writers getting together this weekend for the podcast, so watch for that.  I am not sure there will be any other topic discussed, especially if we can get Paul to show up and defend his stance.  </p>
<p>If you have a good take on the situation, leave a comment here or e-mail us and we'll read it on the podcast.  The e-mail address is:  podcast@ivyenvy.com</p>
