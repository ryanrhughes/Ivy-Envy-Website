    I have become a fan of Len and Bob.  At first, Bob seems like he might not be very intelligent, but he really is insightful about the game having been a player and a manager.  Sometimes he will have quite a flash of intelligence as well.  As I said in a previous post, we are fortunate to have Len and Bob and not commentators like the Hawk and DJ.

    I don't mind Pat and Ron, but that might be a result of me not listening to their broadcast much.

    But Ron has no legs. He gets added sympathy points. Any time a Cubs pitcher throws over 95 mph someone makes a "big, big" donation to JDRF. And I like how he says "back to back jacks" even though they quit that promotion two years ago.

    So, while I enjoy Len and Bob, I prefer Pat and Ron. I don't do the tv down radio up because the delay is off. I agree with all of the above, except I find Ron humorously tolerable.

    I've noticed that the delay is not always there, though.  There is automatically a delay if you watch games on digital cable.  One of our tv's is not on digital cable and there is about a 2-3 second delay from that one to our other tv.  ESPN also has a delay.  If you don't go through your cable box and it's a WGN or Comcast broadcast, it should line up pretty close.

    Last night, I had to turn on Pat and Ron because I can't stomach ESPN announcers.

<p>I had a conversation with my Aunt and Uncle (Manstrength's parents) over the weekend and they both expressed that they can't stand Len and Bob as announcers.&nbsp; I have never thought of them as bad announcers or annoying,<a id="more"></a><a id="more-99"></a>&nbsp;so I wanted to see what you readers think about them.</p>
<p>Now, Len and Bob are not my favorite announcers, but I have respect for anyone that can talk for about 3 hours, 162 times a year and not come across as a conversation-repeating idiot.&nbsp; I think because I have heard so many bad announcers over the years, Len and Bob don't seem that bad to me.&nbsp; Listen to ESPN or FOX baseball broadcasts and you'll hear what I consider to be the bottom of the barrel.&nbsp; When it comes to baseball, I want some opinion or for a lack of a better word, homer-ism displayed.&nbsp; When you listen to a local broadcast, you're getting the inside scoop.&nbsp; You're hearing things from guys that spend a ridiculous amount of time with the team.&nbsp; If you listen to ESPN, you are hearing generic play-by-play calling and some fluff piece about a player that they will talk about every single broadcast they do for that particular team.&nbsp; Oh yeah, and you hear about the Yankees and the Red Sox.&nbsp; While we are on the topic of bad sports announcers, my most hated are Brent Musberger and Keith Jackson.&nbsp; I'll spare you all from my Brent Musberger rant...for now.</p>
<p>Now, I wouldn't put Len or Bob in the same category as Vin Scully.&nbsp; Vin is my all-time favorite announcer.&nbsp; When I lived in Southern California, I watched Dodgers broadcasts, just to listen to him call a game.&nbsp; But, these two are way better than Hawk and DJ, who announce for the White Sox.&nbsp; It's unbelievable how bad those guys are.&nbsp; When I travel to a different part of the country, I always try to listen baseball game or football game on tv or radio, just to hear the local announcers.&nbsp; I've not really heard any that astounded me.&nbsp; I have liked about everyone that the Diamondbacks have had in the booth, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to say though, that this year, I have grown real tired of listening to Pat and Ron on the radio.&nbsp; I like Pat, but Ron is just terrible.&nbsp; He adds nothing to the broadcast besides having a fan in the booth.&nbsp; And I can appreciate that he plays that role, but then he just needs to be a fan and shut up.&nbsp; I think it's his unfinished sentences that get me the most.&nbsp; "Well, the thing about that is...."&nbsp; or "One of the most important things about playing shortstop is...."&nbsp; and he never finishes the sentence.&nbsp; It takes him 10 seconds to get that much of the sentence out and then the next pitch distracts him.&nbsp; I used to think of Ron as the drunk, slightly off uncle that entertains the family at a gathering, but you wouldn't trust him with anything.&nbsp; Now he just irritates me.&nbsp; Maybe Ron and I just need some time apart.</p>
<p>My solution for WGN radio is this...add another announcer in the booth.&nbsp; Let Ron play the role as the ultimate homer in the booth and don't put the pressure on him to say anything profound or insightful.&nbsp; Historically, I haven't liked 3 announcers in the booth.&nbsp; I end up turning the volume down on Monday Night Football because none of them ever shut up.&nbsp; But the radio is something different.&nbsp; Descriptions are all we have to put us in the stadium.&nbsp; And right now on WGN radio, there is 1.5 guys in the booth, so I think adding another person wouldn't be overkill.</p>
<p>So tell me Cubs fans, what do you think of Len &amp; Bob and Pat &amp; Ron?&nbsp; In my opinion, no Cubs broadcast will be as good as Harry Caray and Steve Stone.&nbsp; But what kind of game viewer are you?&nbsp; Do you listen to Len and Bob or do you turn the volume on the tv down and listen to Pat and Ron?&nbsp;</p>
