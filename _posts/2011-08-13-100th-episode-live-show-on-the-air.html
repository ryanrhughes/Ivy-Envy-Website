<p>Our shindig for the Ivy Envy Podcast's 100th episode is now live.  Click on the "Live Broadcast" tab at the top of the page or go <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?page_id=5362" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>On that page is a video/audio feed from Ustream and an audio feed from Mixlr.  There is also a chat at the bottom of the page.  This show is dedicated to calls from you, the listeners.  You are suffering through this Cubs season along with us, so call in and let us know how you're feeling.  </p>
<p>If you're heading out for the night, go to <a href="http://www.mixlr.com" target="_blank">www.mixlr.com</a> on your mobile phone and click on the Ivy Envy show in the list.  That will play the broadcast in your built-in audio player on your phone.  </p>
<p>Check out the post below to see the prizes that we will be giving away during the show.  </p>
<p>If you want to call and talk with us, the phone number is: 309-623-4936.  If we don't pick up your call, that means we are on the line with someone else and try back in a few minutes.  </p>
<p>Turn on the Cubs game, turn down Len and Bob, go to our broadcast page, kick back with a Hamm's and give us a call.  Sounds like a great Saturday evening.  </p>
