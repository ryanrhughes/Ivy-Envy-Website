<p>Life's busy and it's just not going to happen this week.&nbsp; We'll have a new episode up Monday, August 3rd.</p>
<p>Also, we're looking to add a few new voices to the podcast.&nbsp; If you live in the Quad Cities and you'd like to talk about the Cubs while being recorded, get in contact with me through e-mail.</p>
<p>If you don't live in the Quad Cities but listen and find yourself yelling at us because you disagree and you wish you could get your opinion out there, we might be able to get you on the podcast, too.</p>
<p>The e-mail address is:&nbsp; corey@ivyenvy.com</p>
