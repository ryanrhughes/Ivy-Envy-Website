<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Javier-Baez.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Javier-Baez-300x179.jpg" alt="Javier Baez" width="300" height="179" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9957" /></a>Heading out of Spring Training, it seemed inevitable that Javier Baez would dominate the AAA level and receive the call to Chicago once the Cubs were certain the Super Two deadline had passed. By the way, if you'd like an explanation of why the Cubs wouldn't know the exact date they could call him up, read this post on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/javier-baez-super-two-status/" target="_blank">Javier Baez and Super Two Status</a>. </p>
<p>As it turns out, Baez has not dominated the AAA level.  A week ago, Javier Baez's batting average was .142 and if the call was happening in 2014, it looked like it would happen much later in the season.  </p>
<p>Struggles for Baez aren't completely unexpected.  With his bat speed, pitchers at any level will have a hard time throwing a fastball past him.  It's the off-speed stuff that Baez is going to have to figure out.  </p>
<p>Baez had few issues with lower-level off-speed stuff because it's really just not that good.  Most lower-level minor league pitchers haven't mastered their off-speed pitches and the control isn't great.  </p>
<p>It hasn't been time to sound the alarms over Baez's struggles, but it has been disappointing for those of us that were hoping to have the first piece of this huge Cubs rebuild in Wrigley and on our televisions this summer.  At the same time, struggles at the AAA level are probably good for Baez.  It's best to have those experiences in the minors to use as learning experiences when the same struggles happen in his big league years.  </p>
<p>On our podcast recently, we have talked about that when Baez broke out of this slump, his breakout would be remarkable, like everything else he's done in the minor leagues.  </p>
<p>So are the AAA struggles over?  Maybe.  After last night's 4-5 performance with 2 doubles and a home run, Baez has a 7-game hitting streak and in those games, he's hitting .429.  He also has 3 home runs in that stretch, which matches his total for the season up to that point.  In a week, he raised that .145 batting average to .201.  </p>
<p>A breakout couldn't come at a better time for us Ivy Envy guys.  Our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/iowa" target="_blank">Iowa Cubs Meet-up</a> is tomorrow and with a Left Field Suite, we'll be ready for a show.  </p>
