<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Arrieta.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Arrieta-300x195.jpg" alt="Jake Arrieta" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9105" /></a>In late March I took a <a title="look back" href="http://http://ivyenvy.com/theo-thievery-breaking-matt-garza-trade/" target="_blank">look back</a> at the Matt Garza trade, concluding with relative ease that the Cubs had come away on the &lsquo;winning&rsquo; side of things.&nbsp; Today I&rsquo;ll look at another Cubs coup.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been exactly one year since the Orioles and Cubs consummated a deal that sent Scott Feldman and back-up catcher Steve Clevenger to crabcake country in exchange for Jake Arrieta, Pedro Strop, and money to use towards international signing bonuses.</p>
<p>Feldman had signed with Chicago the previous off-season, accepting&nbsp;a one-year deal worth $6 million and the promise of a spot in the rotation after being&nbsp;bounced around from starter to reliever during his stead with the Rangers.&nbsp; A clear cut flip candidate from the outset, Feldman took full advantage of the opportunity, posting a 3.46 ERA in 15 starts for his new squad, and the Cubs, in turn, took full advantage of their successful gamble, turning Feldman into a quality reliever and a former top prospect when playoff contenders came knocking.</p>
<p>Pedro Strop&rsquo;s ceiling never matched that of Arrieta&rsquo;s, but he has been a solid addition to the north side nonetheless. The reliever has posted a sub-3.00 ERA in 68 appearances for the Cubs over parts of the last two seasons and has struck out over a batter per inning.</p>
<p>Still, the big get for Chicago was Jake Arrieta. At the time of the deal, Arrieta had taken the shape&nbsp;of a post-hype sleeper, a highly touted prospect who was underwhelming in his first few big league seasons, but continued to show glimpses of what could be if he ever put it all together.</p>
<p>The start of Arrieta&rsquo;s 2014 campaign was delayed by shoulder inflammation but he has been outstanding since returning from the DL and has looked every bit the part of the #3 starter scouts projected him as when he was drafted out of TCU. In fact, Arrieta has been even better than that, posting a miniscule 1.81 ERA in 11 starts with a WHIP barely eclipsing 1.000 in 2014.</p>
<p>In Arrieta&rsquo;s last five starts he has allowed just three runs in 34.2 innings and has racked up 46 strikeouts. Monday against Boston he didn&rsquo;t allow a hit until there were two outs in the 8<sup>th</sup> inning. Suffice it to say, he is putting it all together.</p>
<p>While the Matt Garza trade brought in more assets and press, with Jake Arrieta realizing his full potential in the Friendly Confines, it appears the most impactful piece acquired before last year&rsquo;s trade deadline actually came in the Scott Feldman deal.</p>
<p>Though their names don&rsquo;t make them as easy to recognize in alliterative headlines, more in the Cubs front office than just Theo deserve credit for crafting these thefty moves last year. Jed and Jason and the whole baseball operations department have clearly been outstanding to this point. The takeaway now, as we see endless rumors surrounding Samardzija, Hammel, etc., isn't who deserves the praise, but that the boys in charge have built a strong track record in a limited amount of time in Chicago and if they can strike again at the approaching 2014 trade deadline, the optimism surrounding the 2015 campaign will look very well-founded.</p>
