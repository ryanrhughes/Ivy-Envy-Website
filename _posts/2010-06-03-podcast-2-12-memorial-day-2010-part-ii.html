<p>Part II of our Memorial Day episode.  It's like Episode 2.11, but with more passing out. Tim joins us straight from basic training to describe what it's like trying to follow the Cubs while in the military.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will post photos from this thing.  If you've ever wanted to see what Andy looks like passed out while on mic, stay tuned.  </p>
