  content: I listened to this one again, and I've got to say, Gus had a great sense
    of humor about the Dodgers.  If I were in his place, I would probably get pretty
    defensive.

<p>Listen to Episode 2.18 to hear Corey's experience at Dodger Stadium before you listen to this episode.&nbsp; On Part II, we welcome Dodgers season-ticket holder, Gus Hernandez to explain the conduct of Dodgers fans at their stadium.&nbsp; This is a great interview, so don't look past this episode.&nbsp; The highlight is Gus describing his first game as a season-ticket holder.</p>
