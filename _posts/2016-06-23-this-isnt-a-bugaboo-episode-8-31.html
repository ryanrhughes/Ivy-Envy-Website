This is most likely the earliest recording in the history of our podcast.  Nothing gets going in the morning like a series sweep at the hands of the Cardinals, right?</p>
<p>Well, this series was definitely frustrating. Whenever anything has looked bad for the Cubs this season, we've found the silver lining and we do that on this episode.  However, it's worth mentioning that the Cardinals are a good baseball team and they're probably not going to go away without putting up a fight.  </p>
<p>We also look at the roster moves the Cubs have made this week. Fowler and Richard went to the DL, Adam Warren was sent to AAA to stretch out to start some games and the Cubs brought up some bullpen relief (Edwards Jr., Concepcion, and Patton).  </p>
<p>We discuss these players and then Andy shares a Rube story with us.  </p>
