<p>While we never posted much about our bus trip to see the Cubs play the Braves this last August, trust me that it was a blast.  56 Cubs fans from the Quad Cities piled in a chartered bus to go watch a Cubs team that performed poorly all season beat an eventual playoff team.  If you would like to see some of the photos from this day, become a fan of us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946#!/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and check out the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=193647&amp;id=298438948946" target="_blank">Bus Trip Album</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't hear one negative thing from anyone about the day.  I had quite a few suggestions for the 2011 Bus Trip and you can imagine the teams that most people wanted to go see were the Cardinals and White Sox.  If that's who you wanted to see, I can pretty much assure you those two teams will be on the top of the list for 2012.  There is a match-up in 2011 that I just couldn't pass up.</p>
<p>The 2011 Bus Trip is tentatively planned for June 18th, when the New York Yankees come to Chicago to face the Cubs.  The only thing that would keep this from happening is if the Cubs do not release these tickets (very high demand) to the bus companies like they usually do.  The representative from the bus company had never heard of such an event, so she felt this was a done-deal.</p>
<p>The Yankees will return to the location of Babe Ruth's supposed called shot in the 1932 World Series.  Also, for those of you that wanted to see Joe Girardi manage the Cubs, seeing him at Wrigley is the closest you'll probably ever get.  While most Cubs fans won't count on this being a preview of the 2011 World Series, any baseball fan will enjoy the opportunity to see these two teams with a combined 245 years of MLB service and 29 World Series Championships (yeah, two belong to the Cubs) face off at Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>Details about this trip will come in a few months.  I will open up the trip for reservations a few days after the Cubs release the tickets for the 2011 season.
