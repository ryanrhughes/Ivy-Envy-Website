<p>We spend a healthy amount of time talking about Kris Bryant's play, especially in Tuesday night's game.  Jon Lester has a good outing and Jake Arrieta makes Corey look like he actually knows what he's talking about.  </p>
<p>We also talk about the back end of the rotation and how any long winning streak is going to require the #4 and #5 spots in the rotation to provide a little more. </p>
<p>We answer a voicemail question from Josh in New Jersey. Josh asks about the rumored trade talks between the Cubs and Mets.  We discourage you from reading too much into it...then we read too much into it. </p>
<p>Sean asks a question about closers in non-save situations.  Michael asks about the Cubs hitting in the 7<sup>th</sup> inning and later.  </p>
<p>If you have not yet filled out one of our listener surveys, we can finish this campaign with one final push.  Please go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/survey" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/survey</a>.  This should not take you more than 30 seconds and we'd really appreciate it.  </p>
