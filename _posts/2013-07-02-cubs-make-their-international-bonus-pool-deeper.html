<p>The Cubs have been very active in the trade market today. &nbsp;Here is a quick summary of their moves so far--</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Trade #1</span></strong><br />
The Cubs sent Scott Feldman and Steve Clevenger to the Orioles for pitchers Jake Arrieta and Pedro Strop. &nbsp;In addition to the two pitchers, the Cubs received significant international bonus pool money from the Orioles. &nbsp;Feldman pitched well for the Cubs this season, and his departure will likely make the remainder of this season that much harder to watch. &nbsp;However, it made a lot of sense for the Cubs to part ways with him as he would've been in line for a much larger contract after this seasonn (he had a 1-year, 6-mil. contract with the Cubs). &nbsp;Arrieta and Strop are both pitchers who have fastballs that sit in the mid-nineties, and have been described by multiple sources as being guys who perhaps just needed "a change of scenery." &nbsp;Strop will join the Cubs this week, and it sounds like Arrieta will begin in Iowa. &nbsp;Arrieta did make the Orioles opening-day roster this year, so he would be able to pitch for the Cubs if they trade any more of their current rotation. &nbsp;Including Clevenger in the deal seemed like almost a gift to him since he is from Baltimore originally.</p>
<p>Arrieta this season-- 5 starts, 7.23 ERA, 8.7 K/9, 6.5 BB/9</p>
<p>Strop this season--29 app, 7.25 ERA, 9.7 K/9, 6 BB/9</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trade #2</strong><br />
In a trade with the Dodgers, the Cubs exchanged Carlos Marmol for veteran RHP Matt Guerrier. &nbsp;The Cubs also gave the Dodgers their fourth international bonus slot. &nbsp;Guerrier is a 34-year-old, right-handed reliever. &nbsp;In 34 appearances this year, Guerrier had a 4.80 ERA with 6.3 K/9 and 3.6 BB/9. &nbsp;Both Marmol and Guerrier had been DFA'd by their respective clubs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trade #3</strong><br />
The Cubs gave the Astros 2B Ronald Torreyes (who had been playing in AA Tennessee) in exchange for the Astros' two and three international bonus slots. &nbsp;Torreyes was a good hitting prospect but apparently doesn't hit for power at all. &nbsp;On the podcast, we've talked about how the Cubs have a number of infield prospects who can potentially hit for average and power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Len Kasper pointed out on Twitter that if people focus on the players obtained in these trades, they would be "missing the [point]." &nbsp;<strong>The important part of these trades is all the international bonus pool money that the Cubs obtained.</strong>&nbsp; The Cubs gained $963,000 in money that they will use to secure even more young talent. &nbsp;Hoyer told Paul Sullivan that the within the group of international players available now, there is a lot of "impact talent." &nbsp;The Cubs have already begun to obtain multiple international prospects, and we will address that topic in a separate post.</p>
