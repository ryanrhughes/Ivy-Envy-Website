<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Gillispie-.jpeg"><img data-id="11066"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Gillispie--300x300.jpeg" alt="Gillispie" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11066" /></a>On Wednesday, we were invited to serve as audio engineers for the Cubs broadcast with Mick Gillispie and Len Kasper.  It was an incredible experience and we will talk about it on the next episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.</p>
<p>After the braodcast was finished, we had the opportunity to interview Mick Gillispie.  In addition to being one of the Spring Training voices of Cubs baseball, he's also the broadcaster for the Cubs Double-A affiliate, the Tennessee Smokies.  </p>
<p>We think you will enjoy this opportunity to get to know Mick a little better.  Give him a follow on Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/broadcastermick" target="_blank">@BroadcasterMick</a> and listen to Mick broadcast the Smokies game on the MiLB mobile app, the TuneIn app or on MiLB.tv.</p>
