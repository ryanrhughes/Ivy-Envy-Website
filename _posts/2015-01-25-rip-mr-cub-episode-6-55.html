<p>The Cubs lost a legend this week with the passing of Mr. Cub, Ernie Banks. On this, the 292<sup>nd</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about Ernie's on-the-field accomplishments and what he meant to Cubs fans after his retirement.</p>
<p>This week, the Cubs traded Luis Valbuena and Dan Straily for Dexter Fowler. We talk about how our opinions of Valbuena changed over the last few years and what the trade means for the outfield and infield for the 2015 Cubs.</p>
<p>We check back in on Javier Baez, who is playing winter ball in Puerto Rico. Baez has not figured out his strikeout issue and his spot on the opening day roster seems to be in question.</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions and read some internet muscle flexes.</p>
