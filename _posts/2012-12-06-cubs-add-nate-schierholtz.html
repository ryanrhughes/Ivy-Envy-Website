<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left;">Reporters are reportedly reporting that the Cubs have agreed to sign RF Nate Schierholtz to a one-year, 2.25 million dollar contract. &nbsp;Like many of the other contracts we've seen so far in the offseason, this one is also incentive-heavy. &nbsp;I like this trend in contracts since "taking pride in one's work" doesn't always seem to be enough of a motivating factor for some players. &nbsp;A lack of motivation doesn't seem to be an issue with Schierholtz, however. &nbsp;He apparently turned down at least one longer contract that was worth more money than the Cubs' contract. &nbsp;It sounds like the guy wants to play every day, and he expects the Cubs to be able to grant him that wish. &nbsp;David DeJesus will most likely be playing center this season to make way for Schierholtz in right. &nbsp;The most plate appearances he has had in one season is 362 in 2011. &nbsp;Hopefully he is a guy who will be able to come in and make the most of the copious playing time he sounds likely to receive. &nbsp;</span></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Schierholtz is strong defensively which is a must for RF at Wrigley, and Carrie Muskat mentioned in her article that he "has one of the best throwing arms in the league." &nbsp;His career batting average is .270, and he bats left-handed. &nbsp;This gives the Cubs quite a few lefties in the lineup, especially if the re-signing of Ian Stewart is true. &nbsp;Ivy Envy writer Corey was reportedly excited that the new signing's name contained the words "sheer" and "Holtz."</p></p>
