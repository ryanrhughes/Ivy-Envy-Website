  content: Of course, .270 isn't a horrible batting average... especially for a catcher.  Kendall
    also was fearless about getting hit with a pitch, something that doesn't show
    up in the stats column.  Reed Johnson's style reminds me of that aspect of Kendall.  Yeah,
    I wish Murton would make it back!

  content: I am/was a big Kendall fan.  Sure, he wasn't the best at throwing out
    base stealers, but he brought a lot to the team in other areas.

    I thought you were a Kendall fan.  I never really liked him.  I've always thought that when a catcher gives up that many free bases, it kind of takes away anything he can do with a bat in his hand.  But he didn't do much with a bat in his hand....57 games, .270 1HR and 19RBI's.

    But you know, we are all drawn to certain players.  My intention isn't to discredit your appreciation for him.  I mean, my favorite Cub can't hit anything bigger than a single and is sitting in Triple A.

<p>Geovany Soto was voted the top rookie in the National League for the month of April.&nbsp; Also in the running was Kosuke Fukudome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the month of April, Soto hit <a id="more"></a><a id="more-67"></a>.341, had 5 HR and 20 RBI's.&nbsp; His OPS (On-base plus slugging percentage) was 1.059.&nbsp; Soto came up late last season to share the dish with Koyie Hill and batted .389 with 3 HR and 8 RBI's in 18 games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I appreciate the most about Soto is how much of an improvement he is compared to Jason Kendall.&nbsp; In the 52 games before he was traded to Oakland, Kendall gave up 52 stolen bases and only threw out 5 baserunners.&nbsp; That's a success rate under 9%.&nbsp; This year, Soto has given up 15 stolen bases and thrown out 10 baserunners.&nbsp; Soto's rate of throwing out baserunners is 40%.&nbsp; I just remember teams running all over Kendall, so it's nice to have a legitimate threat behind the plate.&nbsp;</p>
