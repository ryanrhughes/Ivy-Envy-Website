<p>Many of these games were close, half of them were 1-run games.  We have a strange and alien feeling during these close games.  It's something called confidence.  We discuss the positives and negatives of these close games.  </p>
<p>Fans are having fun watching this team and it's easy to see that the players are having fun, too.  Not only can we see the chemistry on the field, but Twitter has allowed players to communicate with fans and at the same time, display their excitement about the team. #wearegood</p>
<p>We also answer lots of listener questions on these 2015 Cubs.  </p>
