<p><img data-id="11722"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-300x300.jpeg" alt="image" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11722" />Welcome to the 385th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  Opening Day is just a week away and we start wrapping up Spring Training 2016 on this episode.  We are back from our trip to Mesa and we share some of our thoughts on what we saw out there.  We talk about the roster situation and the options the Cubs have for the last spot on the 25-man roster.  </p>
<p>Jake Arrieta's opening day start looked up-in-the-air a few days ago when he looked poor in a start vs. the Giants and then reportedly left with a thumb blister.  Supposedly, Arrieta and his thumb are fine after a bullpen side session and he's on track to take the mound next Monday night vs. the Angels in Anaheim to start the 2016 season.  </p>
