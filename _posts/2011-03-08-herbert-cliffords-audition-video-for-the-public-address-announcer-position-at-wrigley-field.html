  content: This guy is so so terrible.  He is only kidding hisself if he thinks he
    has a chance.  Seriosly, Wrigley Stadium??  Just like american idol, this contest
    makes the crazys come out of the woodwork.  Personally, I think i have this one
    in the bag.  if you heard the man with the golden voice, mine is soo much better.

  content: I think the Cubs should hire Herbert.  He has such a musical voice, and
    he would be unique in the monochromatic world of p.a. announcers.  Haters gonna
    hate.

<p>The Cubs have a job opening for the 2011 season and they have gone to their fans in search for one of the most "dream job" positions with the organization.&nbsp; The Cubs teamed up with CareerBuilder.com to find the new Public Address Announcer at Wrigley Field.&nbsp; The submission deadline has passed and nearly 3000 people sent their resumes in and uploaded their audition videos to Youtube in hopes of  becoming "The Voice of Wrigley".  </p>
<p>A reader of the blog and listener of the podcast e-mailed me and shared his submission for this position with me.&nbsp; I asked him if I could share this video with the rest of our readers and he gave me permission.&nbsp; I introduce to you, Herbert Clifford.</p>
