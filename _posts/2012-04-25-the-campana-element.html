  content: Last year though he was hitting .259 with a .303 OBP. I'm not against him
    being up here, because he's not part of the future and he does provide you speed.
    He's doing a good job so far this year and&nbsp;I hope he can keep it up, I'll
    happily eat my words, but at this point I'd go as far as saying&nbsp;he's not
    a major league baseball player.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  content: I don't disagree with you. &nbsp;But I think because the team lacks most
    other methods of scoring runs, I think they need to use what they have in Tony
    Campana. &nbsp;His OBP will decrease, but I think we should also keep an eye on
    WHEN he comes through. &nbsp;There's nobody else on this team that can get a base
    hit and within a few pitches to a batter, be standing 90 feet from scoring. &nbsp;

  content: I think the fact that he doesn't look like a major league player has something
    to do with it.&nbsp; It's a corny thing to say...but it HAS to have something
    to do with it.&nbsp;

    Len and Bob commented on his base stealing yesterday. Len shared a stat about the likelihood of him stealing third after he steals second. Can't remember it exactly and couldn't find it online, but I think it was about half the time.
    &nbsp;
    This is what I could find:
    He's reached based 53 times. He's stolen 28 bases and only been caught twice when everybody paying attention knows he's going to run. If I learned anything from Jonah Hill in Moneyball it's that total bases are pretty important in sabermetrics.
    &nbsp;
    I can look past his lower OBP because he's such a great weapon as a pinch runner late in close games.

  content: And like Kurt is saying, it's later in games.&nbsp; The only real way to
    quantify a stat like that is to break it up into the OBP from the actual individual
    innings themselves and when you do that (in my opinion) you end up with too many
    different numbers floating around.&nbsp;

<p>When the Cubs sent Tony Campana to Iowa to begin the 2012 season, I stated on that week's episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast that I did not like the move because Campana brings an element to the game that nobody else on the roster can bring.  Campana has demonstrated that element in the last two games.</p>
<p>In the 8th inning of Monday's game, the Cubs brought Campana in to pinch-hit and Campana delivered with a one-out single with the game tied 2-2.  During Darwin Barney's at-bat, Campana went from 1st to 3rd via two stolen bases.  Starlin Castro then stranded Campana at third base to end the 8th inning.  The Cubs went on to win the game in the bottom of the 9th, taking game one of the series with the Cardinals.  </p>
<p>Campana scored the game-winning run in the 10th inning of Tuesday night's game.  Again with one-out, Campana got a base-hit and swiped 2nd base, albeit on a questionable call.  Then with two outs, Alfonso Soriano came through with a hit, which was deflected off Cardinals 2nd baseman, Tyler Greene.  Campana scored from 2nd and the Cubs won their second straight game in walk-off fashion.  </p>
<p>Campana's job is to get on base and get himself in position to score.  In his short time with the Cubs since being recalled, Campana is batting .556 with an OBP of .600.  Campana has 4 stolen bases in 9 plate appearances.  He's getting on base and getting into scoring position.  </p>
<p>Since the Cubs are clearly not going to be a power-hitting team in 2012, they are going to need to generate runs and there's nobody close to Campana in the ability to generate runs.  As we saw in Monday night's game, it's going to be up to those following Campana to get him in.  </p>
<p>While Campana's average and on-base percentage will surely drop, there's no question that he is valuable to this team.  It's good to see him in Chicago and helping the Cubs win.  </p>
