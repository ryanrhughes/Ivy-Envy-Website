Thanks in part to the donations from our listeners, we have equipped the studio with cameras and broadcasting software.  </p>
<p>These broadcasts will be every Saturday morning at 10am CST.  Simply come to our site and click on the "Live Broadcast" graphic on the side of our page.  You can also interact with us and other listeners by clicking on the chat option under the video player.  </p>
<p>We'd like to thank everyone that helped make this possible and we're looking forward to enhancing your Ivy Envy Podcast experience.  </p>
