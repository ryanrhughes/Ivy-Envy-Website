<p>Jeremy joins Andy, Corey and Kurt to share his experiences from Cubs Convention this past weekend.  We also take notice of the trade that sent Gorzelanny to the Nationals for Michael Burgess, AJ Morris and Graham Nicks.&nbsp;  Here are the three new guys.&nbsp; Based purely on this photo alone, Burgess is my 2nd favorite pick-up by the Cubs in this off-season.</p>
