<p>There was only one Cubs game between our last episode and this one, so we answer some questions about Cubs players sent in by Laura.  She asks us what Cubs player we think the Cardinals would swipe from the Cubs.  We consulted a few Cardinals fans to get their input and their answer was not surprising.  </p>
<p>Laura also brings up they hypothetical situation of an MLB expansion draft, similar to the 1997 draft when Tampa Bay and Arizona came into the league.  Each existing MLB team was able to protect 15 players, organization-wide.  We read Laura's list of the 15 players that she would protect and then share our own.  </p>
<p>At the end of the episode, we play a song by Cubs fan, <a href="http://katiedaymusic.com" target="_blank">Katie Day</a>.  This is Katie's song "By the Lakeside" with words and Cubs images that may or may not make you tear up.<br />
