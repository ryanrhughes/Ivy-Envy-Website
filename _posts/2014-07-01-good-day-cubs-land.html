<p><a href="/uploads/2014/07/Good-Day-Cubs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10172" src="/uploads/2014/07/Good-Day-Cubs-300x300.jpg" alt="Good Day Cubs" width="300" height="300" /></a>There haven't been many days that left Cubs fans satisfied, but Monday was a day that brought both immediate satisfaction and signals that many more of these days are on the horizon.</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/never-gonna-get-it-podcast-episode-620/" target="_blank">On this week's episode of our podcast</a>, we pointed to the reasons that the Cubs finished over .500 in the month of June and many of these reasons involve players that will be part of the future of this organization. We discussed Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro anchoring the offense and the young pitchers that have recently performed well. If you're talking recent pitching performances, Jake Arrieta had a humdinger Monday evening in Boston.</p>
<h3>Jake Arrieta</h3><br />
Arrieta flirted with a no-hitter for his second straight outing, limited the Boston Red Sox to only a walk until Stephen Drew broke up the no-no with 2 outs in the 9th inning. Renteria quickly pulled Arrieta after the hit as it was his 120th pitch of the evening. &nbsp;How good has Arrieta been in the month of June? In 6 starts, he is 4-0 with a 0.92 ERA. He struck out 48 and walked just 6. Opponents hit .157 off Arrieta in the month.</p>
<p>With Samardzija and Hammel likely on their way out in the next month, Arrieta's performance this year, Dallas Beeler's start on Saturday and the handful of starters in Iowa will make those departures not quite as devastating to the pitching staff as the trades of pitchers we've seen in the last few years.</p>
<h3>Jason McLeod</h3><br />
In other (and probably bigger) news, <a href="http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/11159119/jason-mcleod-cubs-senior-vice-president-player-development-amateur-scouting-withdraws-name-san-diego-padres-general-manager-search" target="_blank">Jason McLeod withdrew his name</a> from consideration for the San Diego Padres GM job. McLeod is a main reason the Cubs' minor league system has gone from one of the worst to arguably the best in just three seasons.</p>
<p>McLeod admitted that the Padres GM job is one of his dream jobs, but his reasoning for staying with the Cubs should excite us.</p>
<blockquote><p>...as I got to reflect on it, this is where I want to be right now. I got so many good things going on right now. to sound corny, we put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into this. I just really believe in the vision and direction. I really want to be here when we win.</blockquote><br />
We're seeing things start to come together and these front office guys are individually committed to their plan and want to see it through. With a solid plan and an organization headed in the right direction, our scares of other organizations picking off McLeod and others are not over. That's a good sign.</p>
<h3>Kris Bryant</h3><br />
Then to top things off, Kris Bryant hit a grand slam to help power the Iowa Cubs to a 7-6 victory over the Omaha Storm Chasers (Royals) Monday night.</p>
<p><center><iframe src="http://www.milb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=34191555&amp;width=400&amp;height=224&amp;property=milb" width="400" height="224" frameborder="0">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></center></p>
<p>In his 12 games since joining Iowa, Bryant is hitting .333/.412/.800.  Bryant now has 6 home runs (in 12 games!) and 3 doubles.  It's probably only a matter of time until Bryant starts hauling in weekly performance awards at AAA like he did in AA.  Bryant was named the Southern League Player of the Week 3 times in the first half of this season.</p>
<h3>Player of the Week Awards</h3><br />
Speaking of weekly performance awards, Kyle Schwarber (Midwest League), Daury Torrez (Midwest League) and Arismendy Alcantara (Pacific Coast League) <a href="http://www.csnchicago.com/cubs/cubs-prospects-schwarber-alcantara-earn-weekly-honors" target="_blank">earned weekly awards</a> because of their recent performances.  </p>
<p>Since his promotion from Boise to Kane County, Schwarber is hitting .412/.512/.882 with 4 home runs.  He's kept his strikeouts down, with 7 of them compared to 6 walks.  Kris Bryant was the top college bat in his draft and within a year of signing is at AAA.  Schwarber is not Kris Bryant, but he's clearly not having any issues with lower level minor league pitching and I think we'll see him start 2015 with Tennessee.  </p>
<p>Daury Torrez of Kane County was named the Pitcher of the Week in the Midwest League.  Torrez was dominant in his one outing during the week.  He went 8 innings and gave up 5 hits, striking out 7 and walking none vs. Wisconsin.  Torrez is now 8-3 with a 3.14 ERA on the season for Kane County.  </p>
<p>On this week's podcast episode, I talked about how I'd like to see Arismendy Alcantara promoted to the Cubs soon.  To win the weekly award in the PCL, Alcantara hit .517 with 2 home runs.  Alcantara is now hitting .305/.347/.543 with 22 doubles, 10 triples and 10 home runs for Iowa this season.  There have recently been rumors that Darwin Barney could be included as a pot sweetener in an upcoming trade.  That would pave the way for an Alcantara promotion.  </p>
<p>Oh yeah...and Manny Ramirez hit a home run for the Iowa Cubs.<br />

<p>It was a good day. </p>
