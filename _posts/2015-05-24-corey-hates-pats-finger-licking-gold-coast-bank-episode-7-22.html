This week, the Cubs went 3-3 on their road trip out west which included series with San Diego and Arizona.  </p>
<p>We talk about the last week in Cubs baseball, focusing on some good pitching out of the back end of the bullpen from Kyle Hendricks and Tsoyushi Wada. We also talk about Anthony Rizzo and his emergence as the leader of this team.  Chris Coghlan has had a rough spring.  Our opinions on Coghlan are mixed.</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions and many topics.  We discuss: Pedro Strop, the Cubs plan in the 2015 MLB draft, Addison Russell's bat grip, adult stuff causing Chris to miss Kris Bryant home runs, Baez/Vogelbach rumors, the Cubs broadcasters, whether or not the Cubs will make a move for a pitcher later in the season, finding a team Cubs fans and Cardinals fans can agree on, the level of disgust we feel losing a series to the Diamondbacks, Kris Bryant's mohawk mullet and finger-licking, the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/bus" target="_blank">2015 Ivy Envy Bus Trip</a>, and the dreaminess of the 2015 Cubs. </p>
