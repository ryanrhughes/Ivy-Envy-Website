  content: "[...] In Episode 4.51 of The Ivy Envy Podcast we gave you our lists for
    the best and the worst of the 2012 Cubs. Here are my top three best of 2012. If
    you would like to hear Andy&#8217;s and Kurt&#8217;s list, you can listen to that
    episode here. [...]"

<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt review the best and worst of the 2012 Cubs in this episode.  We each share our top 3 best and worst things about the year for the Cubs.  We found it to be much easier to come up with 9 of the "worsts", but you'll be surprised that there actually were some things that happened with the 2012 Cubs that  pleased us.  </p>
<p>This list is in no way the definitive list.  In fact, we'd love to hear your opinions and you best/worst list.  Leave them in a comment here on the site or on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> under the post for this podcast episode.  </p>
<p>We will be back next week with a regular episode that will be broadcast live.  During the off-season, the live broadcasts of these podcast recordings is on Tuesday evenings at 8:30pm Central.  You can watch and listen live at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/live</a></p>
