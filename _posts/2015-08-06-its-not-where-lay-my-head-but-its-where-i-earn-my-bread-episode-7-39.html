We recorded this episode during Wednesday's Cubs game against the Pirates when the 6-game winning streak was still intact.  </p>
<p>We look at the trade deadline and discuss the Cubs activity and inactivity at the deadline.  What do the actions of the Cubs front office tell us about how they view this 2015 team?</p>
<p>The Cubs playoff odds went up 30% in the last week and we talk about what led to the winning streak with pitching and offense.  We also talk about where Cubs fans heads should be heading into the last two months of the season.  We also answer a number of listener questions.  </p>
