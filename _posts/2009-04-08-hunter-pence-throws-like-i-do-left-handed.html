  content: I seriously like this guy.  His warm-up swing reminds me of how softball
    girls warm up with those quick short swings.  He runs like a Little Leaguer with
    short quick steps.  I dig him.

  content: I can't say that I like him, but I don't hate him. I've learned my lesson
    though. He was 2 for 4 with a home run and a double. I'll only make fun of opposing
    players when the Cubs aren't playing them.

    he has got to be the most awkward playing in baseball
---
<p>See for yourself. If only I had a video of me throwing left handed. Very awkward. His unmistakable form caught my attention in Monday's game when he made a throw to the plate. I must have played it back five times. I even got confirmation from my girlfriend that he throws kind of like a girl (sorry ladies). He's like watching a little leaguer playing for a major league team,&nbsp;<em><a title="Rookie of the Year" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107985/" target="_blank">Rookie of the Year</a></em> style. He even has that short, choppy warm-up swing that every 12 year old does before they step into the box. The only thing he's missing is a few hard cracks on home plate with his bat. I'm amazed and frustrated that he's as good as he is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep an eye on him tonight, especially if he makes a throw to the plate. And, if you haven't already, try throwing left handed (if you're right handed) next time you're playing some catch.</p>
