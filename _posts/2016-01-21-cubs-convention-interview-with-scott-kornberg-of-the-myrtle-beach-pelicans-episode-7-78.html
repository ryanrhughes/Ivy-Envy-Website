I had the opportunity to talk with Scott Kornberg, the new radio broadcaster of the Myrtle Beach Pelicans. </p>
<p>Scott talks about some of the players Cubs fans may see with Myrtle Beach this year.  He also talks about some unique aspects of the ballpark in Myrtle Beach and how it may impact the statistics of players of a certain profile. </p>
