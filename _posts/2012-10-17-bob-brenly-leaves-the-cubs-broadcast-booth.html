  content: I think Len and Bob made the games a lot easier to watch, especially during
    101 loss seasons and without Bob the games will go by a lot slower. Hopefully,
    the Cubs will hire a former player, maybe Wood, Hollandsworth, or Doug Glanville,
    to replace Brenly since Casper can't deliver a player's perspective. I wonder
    how awkward it will be since Michael Brenly is still in the Cubs organization.

  content: I will miss Bob too. There were times in the last 8 years where I wished
    he would come out of the booth and manage the team himself. Old school philosophy
    and the true grit of a former catcher. Sure he told lots of stories but what else
    was there to talk about? I hope he lands a job as a big league manager again.

Eight years after replacing Steve Stone in the television broadcast booth, Bob Brenly is leaving to pursue other opportunities.  It didn't take long for the speculation to begin on who would be replacing Bob and joining Len Kasper in the booth.  </p>
<p>In my conversations with Cubs fans, it seemed that either you loved or hated Brenly's performance in the booth.  I was a fan of Brenly and enjoyed his analysis and banter.  I think he is knowledgeable and appropriately critical of players, managers and umpires. </p>
<p>I understand the complaints about Bob Brenly.  Bob liked to reminisce his playing days and his management years and success.  These are the things that gave Brenly credibility and his delivery did not bother me.  Was he at times condescending?  Sure, but any of us fans would have been condescending with what we've seen on the field in the last eight years.  </p>
<p>I think many of the complaints fans had with Brenly are the result of these broadcast guys covering 162 games, almost 500 broadcast hours in six months.  That is a ton of time to broadcast and material is sure to be repeated.  Baseball is a very slow game that requires a lot of banter and really has very little play-by-play action.  If you watched a lot of Cubs games, you probably heard about every baseball story that Bob Brenly could remember and was appropriate to repeat.  </p>
<p>If you were not a fan of Brenly, I suggest you listen to the broadcasts of other teams.  The difference in quality was apparent to me after I purchased MLB At-Bat and listened to the broadcasts of Cubs' opponents.  If you'd like a small sample of what most teams' broadcasts are like, just flip on WGN Radio and block out Pat Hughes and listen to Keith Moreland.  We think Keith is awful, but I think he's on par with a lot of broadcasters.  </p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see who replaces Bob Brenly in the booth.  Kerry Wood?  Dan Plesac?  Todd Hollandsworth?  Dave Otto?  How did you feel about Bob Brenly as a Cubs radio broadcaster and who would you like to see replace him?  Comment here or over at our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> under the thread for this blog post.  </p>
<p>I must say though, I'll miss Bob Brenly and his "Yes dear.  You're right.  I'm sorry."  </p>
