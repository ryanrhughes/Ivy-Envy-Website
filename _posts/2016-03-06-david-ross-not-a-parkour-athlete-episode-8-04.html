<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to the 382<sup>nd</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  For the first time since October, we have baseball games to talk about! However, these are Spring Training games, so there's not a ton to talk about. We do share a few thoughts on what we've seen with the Cubs in the first four games of Spring Training.  We also talk about a few things to pay attention to in the next week of Spring Training.</p>
<p>We answer several listener questions, share a Scary Stat of the Week, Andy provides us with a Rube Waddell story and we have a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
