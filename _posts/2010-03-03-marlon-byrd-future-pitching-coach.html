<p>Marlon Byrd has taken it upon himself to assist the Cubs pitching staff this year by <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100302&amp;content_id=8654092&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">pointing it out to them that they are tipping their pitches</a>.&nbsp; The most eye-catching name in this article is Carlos Marmol.&nbsp; I have no doubt that pitch tipping happens far more often that we know, but it would ideally be one of those things that the pitching coach is watching.&nbsp; You typically don't rely on your Center Fielder to pull pitchers aside to coach them on their mound presence and delivery.</p>
<p>This could be an indication of the quality of Rothschild's coaching.&nbsp; I have never liked Rothschild, but I suspect that most of it goes back to the Dusty Baker years.&nbsp; But let me try to be an optimist here.&nbsp; I won't put this on Rothschild, who happens to be the most awkward looking man in a uniform I have ever seen.</p>

<p>I am, instead, going to assume that this is just an indication of the stellar coaching by Rudy Jaramillo that Marlon Byrd has consumed in the last three years in Texas.</p>
