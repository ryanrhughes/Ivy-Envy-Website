The Cubs just wrapped up a series win over the Marlins and we&rsquo;ve got some real exciting games to talk about.  First off, we look back on Sunday&rsquo;s wild extra-innings game against the Mariners.  Then in the final game of the Marlins series, the Cubs put together an unlikely comeback in the 9th.  </p>
<p>After discussing the Cubs play since our last episode, we dip down into the minors and look at how some of the top prospects in the Cubs farm system are doing this season.  </p>
