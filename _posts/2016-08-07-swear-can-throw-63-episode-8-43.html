The Chicago Cubs are on a roll. They&rsquo;ve won 7 games in a row. They&rsquo;re 28 games over .500. They have won every series since the All Star Break. They&rsquo;re 11.5 games ahead of the Cardinals. Things are looking good. Then something dawns on us and we get real nervous about how this all might play out. Listen to find out what stopped us dead in our tracks.</p>
<p>Jorge Soler is back and hitting the ball well. Jake is back to being Jake (without as many strikeouts) and Kyle Hendricks looks better than we would have imagined he would.</p>
<p>Kurt shares a Hendricks Scary Stat, we read some internet muscle flexes, and there&rsquo;s a fair amount of conversation to get us off track.</p>
