Earlier in the month, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/ivy-envy-podcast-hosts-writers-favorite-wrigley-field-memories/" target="_blank">we all shared our favorite memories from Wrigley Field</a>.</p>
<p><u><strong>Corey Fineran</strong></u><br />
I am a Cubs fan and a Notre Dame fan. That makes me part of two fan-bases that are essentially obsessed with tradition and not changing ANYTHING. I definitely fell in this camp as recently as a handful of years ago. Then I realized if I want Wrigley Field to be around for my daughters and their children to enjoy, Wrigley renovations need to happen.</p>
<p>Notre Dame Stadium is "The House that Rockne Built" and a renovation in the 90's left the traditionalists appalled that the new construction would block the view of Touchdown Jesus. It was unfortunate, but necessary.  </p>
<p>Notre Dame recently announced they will introduce artificial field turf.  Alumni are threatening to stop giving money, just as some Cubs fans are vowing to stop going to games and supporting the organization if they make changes to Wrigley Field.  </p>
<p>I wish Wrigley Field could remain the way it is, but the fact of the matter is that it can't.  What we can hope for is that the organization will make the necessary updates and still keep the general vibe and aspects we all love just the same.  </p>
<p>Added revenue streams are necessary, just as necessary as it is for the Cubs to have a facility that is safe for fans and appealing to free agents.  Given all of the raving reviews of the new Spring Training facility in Mesa, I can't wait to walk into a renovated Wrigley Field. </p>

I've always been a nostalgic sports fan. I like old stuff. I'm a sucker for the old timers who "played the game the right way". But as time goes by I'm starting to change my view. Old is not always better. Baseball is business. I love baseball. I don't love big business, but there is no separating the two. Wrigley field needs to be renovated. For business and for baseball. For the fans and for revenue. For those still clinging to nostalgia&mdash;as I very recently have done&mdash;don't forget that in it's 100 year history things have changed at Wrigley Field. Here's just a few.</p>
<ul>
<li>It was originally Weeghman Park.</li>
<li>There was originally no ivy on the walls.</li>
<li>No luxury boxes and certainly no Captain Morgan Club.</li>
<li>The marquee used to be done by hand like the scoreboard (and it was green and then blue).</li>
<li>There were no lights until 1988 (<a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-11-16/news/8703260241_1_amendment-bernard-hansen-night-games" target="_blank">the sky nearly fell when that happened</a>).</li><br />
</ul><br />
While I suppose some would disagree, none of those things have changed what we love about the Cubs and Wrigley. In fact, some ARE what we love about the Cubs and Wrigley. I trust that the Ricketts' aren't going to strip it of everything that makes it the best park in baseball.</p>
<p>The Yankees tore down old Yankee Stadium. "The house that Ruth built". They won 9 world series there. I don't make a habit of comparing the Cubs and my fellow fans to the Yankees and their fans. We're not the same, but perhaps we need to be a little more, pardon the pun, ruthless.</p>

Wrigley Field is old, dilapidated and at one time was literally crumbling to pieces.</p>
<p>And I love it with all of my heart.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what stance I was going to take on this Ivy Envy prompt even though I was the one who pitched the idea. In fact, I&rsquo;m at this paragraph, and I&rsquo;m still not entirely sure I know what I&rsquo;m going to say.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s try to put this together: Wrigley Field is 100 years old and reeeeaaally hasn&rsquo;t changed that much since 1914. If not for the ivy growing up the outfield brick, someone would surely have said, "Wait, you guys &hellip; Did you know some ballparks have lights on their scoreboard that change the score automatically?" "Yeah, I heard some scoreboards shoot off fireworks, too."</p>
<p>No thanks. We prefer things just the way they are &mdash; for-ev-er.</p>
<p>Now that&rsquo;s not to say there&rsquo;s been <em>no</em> progress. I mean, they did replace the absurdly antiquated technology of piss troughs with &hellip; newer piss troughs.</p>
<p>We should celebrate the fact that Wrigley Field has outlasted all but one other park in baseball. It became historic because it was left untouched (disregarded?) all these years. It&rsquo;s one of the few ways a tangible item becomes "historic" outside of being discovered in an archeological dig.</p>
<p>Yet I count myself as one of the millions of Wrigley Field protectors that have flocked to the ballpark to watch a century&rsquo;s worth of shitty baseball. But it&rsquo;s <em>our</em> baseball, and it&rsquo;s one of the only parks that continues to place emphasis on the game.</p>
<p>And I believe that&rsquo;s going to change. </p>
<p>Three years ago, I somewhat publicly predicted that the Cubs would introduce a mascot and fire a T-shirt cannon inside the ballpark before the year 2016.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a bleach-blonde intern and a can of compressed air away from fulfilling what even I would have wagered to be a long shot.</p>
<p>"A mascot? But they don&rsquo;t even have a video board!"</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s all suppress our know-it-all "NOT MY WRIGLEY FIELD!" bravado for a second and ponder the basic question: How do you compete in a money-driven industry with money-hungry owners and money-hungry athletes and NOT open a book on marketing? Families &mdash; with kids &mdash; bring in the cash. The Polish-sausage fingered bachelor buys only so many Old Styles.</p>
<p>And I know you were totally into the game and questioned the manager&rsquo;s decision to pitch to the four-hitter with two outs and first base empty when you were 7 years old, but not "kids these days." </p>
<p>Friends, it&rsquo;s time to tip our cap. The Cubs have had an improbable run. But they need a second act, and it starts with massive renovation and more entertainment. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s business. It makes sense.</p>
<p>And I hate that fact with every ounce of my being.</p>

Wrigley Field is one of the crown jewels, not only of Major League Baseball, but all of professional sports.<br />
But that jewel is in need of polish, and the prongs that hold it in place are rusty.<br />
Everyone on this site loves the Cubs and Wrigley, but it needs improvements and updates. Now, I'm not advocating blowing her up and putting up the latest high-tech hi-rise, or even landing a spaceship on it like the way the Bears did to their house.<br />
What I am talking about is doing some updating. To help pay for those updates requires advertising. To get advertising, you need places to advertise in and around your facility. Businesses aren't romantic. They don't care about how glorious the green ivy looks against the red bricks in the bright August sun. They want return on their investment.To get that initial investment though, you need to show businesses your potential, which includes the packaging, especially when the product on the field is struggling.<br />
When you have a jewel, it's not enough to just display it, you have to put it in the best light.</p>

I am all-in on the Wrigley reno project. The benefits are widespread. For starters, giving the players a clubhouse that isn't a complete embarrassment (widely considered the worst in MLB) is a long time coming.</p>
<p>Revamping the players' stomping grounds will improve morale and broaden the Cubs pitch when trying to recruit free agents. Adding new video boards and signage in general will lead to increased advertising revenue. If even a dime of that new money ends up going towards players salaries, it's a win. Theo has said that when the time is right, the Cubs will step on the throat of every team in the division financially. With the new TV contract on it's way and a farm system that is on the brink of paying massive dividends, we are quickly converging on the time being 'right' to go out and spend money on big name free agents to expedite the rebuild.</p>
<p>The renovations, like every other aspect of 'The Plan' are about building a successful, sustainable future at Wrigley and I am looking forward to the results, both on the field and around the stadium.</p>

Wrigley field is turning 100 years old. To put that number into perspective, I am going to list a few things around when Wrigley or Weeghman Park, was opened.</p>
<ul>
<li>World War I was still a few months away.</li>
<li>The Ottoman Empire was an Empire.</li>
<li>The Model T assembly line was built.</li>
<li>The world's first Airline is started. (St. Petersburg Tampa Airboat line)</li>
<li>The Panama Canal was finished.</li>
<li>Woodrow Wilson was President</li>
<li>George Washington Carver began his experiments with peanuts.</li>
<li>Boston Braves beat the Philadelphia A's for the World Series.</li><br />
</ul><br />
Though Wrigley Field has been renovated in the past, the ballplayer really does need an update. There are multiple issues (like a crumbling upper deck) that need to be address, but the general plan looks amazing on paper. I think that the renovation will be great not only for the team/fanbase, but wonderful for the people that live near this baseball cathedral. Let's be honest, the majority of the business near Wrigley Field IS generated by the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>With all of that being said, I personally find it frustrating to see these delays because they directly effect the performance of the team. The Ricketts' spent a great deal of money to purchase the Cubs. To go along with that, they purchased the team when the economy was just in the toilet. This is one of the reasons why the Tribune company still owns 5% of the team. It was hard to get credit and the Ricketts are paying for that now. This is why you might hear more and more about people investing, as minority share holders. That 300 million is not going to come out of nowhere. I truly believe that the Cubs will NOT spend money until this renovation is complete. We might all love baseball, but the team is a business. Renovation completion is imperative because it will not only free up a large portion of the team budget, but will also help fund the future. The advertising money would pay for several big contracts, but this is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p>The rooftop owners signed a contract in 2004 and it states that the Cubs can't place obstructions, blocking the view. Here is the actual clause wording.</p>
<blockquote><p>6.6 The Cubs shall not erect windscreens or other barriers to obstruct the views of the Rooftops, provided however that temporary items such as banners, flags and decorations for special occasions, shall not be considered as having been erected to obstruct views of the Rooftops. Any expansion of Wrigley Field approved by governmental authorities shall not be a violation of this agreement, including this section.</blockquote></p>
<p>The important caveat of this clause is that the government authorities HAVE approved the expansion. The lawyers will have to fight over whether the large &ldquo;Jumbotron&rdquo; is part of the expansion or not. This will likely go to arbitration and just delays things further. Sigh...</p>
<p>Until this mess settles, let's dream about the future and enjoy the present. If you are going to the ballpark for the centennial celebration, <a href="http://m.cubs.mlb.com/news/2014/04/01/70603944/cubs-turn-back-clock-on-menu-for-wrigley-fields-centennial" target="_blank">have a look at the food specials</a>.</p>
