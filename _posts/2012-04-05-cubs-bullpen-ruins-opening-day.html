    In order to steal third base...you either have to have A)&nbsp;a really good jump, B) be 24 years old, in your prime, and really quick, or C)&nbsp;all four of those things.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    The bullpen was atrocious.&nbsp; Is Kevin Gregg available?&nbsp; Just Kidding.&nbsp; Sort of.&nbsp;

<p>Thursday afternoon, Ryan Dempster took the hill for his second straight Opening Day start.  Dempster, hoping to keep the Nationals offense in check to give his team an opportunity to muscle out a run or two against the formidable opponent, Stephen Strasburg.  </p>
<p>After giving up a first-pitch base hit to Ian Desmond and a walk to Danny Espinosa, Dempster appeared to be set to repeat his rough Opening Day 2011 performance.  This year would be different as he left the runners stranded on 2nd and 3rd, retiring the heart of the Nationals order, getting out of the 1st inning.  Dempster repeated this accomplishment when the Nationals had runners on 2nd and 3rd with 1 out in the 3rd and again retired Adam LaRoche and Jayson Werth.  </p>
<p>From that point on, Dempster was on a mission.  When he was pulled with two outs in the 8th inning, he had shutout the Nationals, giving up just 2 hits and 3 walks while striking out 10.  Enter, the 2012 Chicago Cubs Bullpen.  </p>
<p>New Cubs manager, Dale Sveum called on Kerry Wood with a runner on first and 2 outs in the 8th inning.  On an episode of the podcast in the last month (not sure which one), I said that the Cubs would need the bullpen to perform above expectations because this offense wasn't going to generate a lot of runs and the team would probably be in a lot of low scoring games, with little margin for error.  </p>
<p>Wood promptly walked the first three batters he faced, walking in Desmond, which was a run charged to Dempster.  Mark DeRosa came to the plate with the opportunity to be a (former Cub) Cub-killer, but clearly has some Cub left in him and grounded out to end the inning and avoid a full-blown catastrophe.  </p>
<p>Chad Tracy seized the (former Cub) Cub killer opportunity and smacked a double and his pinch-runner, Brett Carroll scored the go ahead, and eventual winning run on a Desmond single.  The newly signed Ian Stewart crushed a triple in the 9th, which would have easily cleared the wall without the wind blowing in.  Joe Mather was brought in to pinch run, and promptly thrown out at home on a fielder's choice.</p>
<p>Pitching is the story with this game.  Dempster pitched a great game and has nothing to show for it.  This is a concept he is very familiar with, as a Cubs starter.  Marmol lost his first game of the season and while you might think his leash is short, considering how poorly he pitched in Spring Training, the pitcher you would expect to fill in the closer role is the guy that walked three batters and the tying run the inning before when the Cubs only needed one out.  </p>
<p>As the game ended with the Cubs losing 2-1, I couldn't help but think back to the bottom of the 4th inning.  The Cubs had Alfonso Soriano on 2nd and Ian Stewart on 1st with one out.  At the beginning of Spring Training, Soriano was quoted that he hoped the new leadership of the Cubs would give him the green light to run more.  Either they gave him the green light or he decided he wanted to have the first Cubs steal of the 2012 season, but he was thrown out at 3rd.  Jeff Baker walked, and then Marlon Byrd hit an RBI single, scoring Stewart.  If Soriano hadn't been thrown out, the Cubs would have scored two runs in the 4th.  </p>
<p>But I can't go back to the middle of the game and place blame on someone getting caught stealing.  The blame of this game, and probably many more games in 2012, will fall on the Cubs bullpen.  </p>
