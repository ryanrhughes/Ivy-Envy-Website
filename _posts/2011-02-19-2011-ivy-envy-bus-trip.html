<p>We had originally planned to do the 2011 Bus Trip on June 18th, when the New York Yankees visit Wrigley Field.&nbsp; However, the marketing/ticket sales people for the Cubs kept this from happening.&nbsp; If you want the whole story, check out our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3703" target="_blank">Podcast Episode 2.35</a> at around the 8 minute mark.&nbsp; So we apologize for getting your hopes up.&nbsp; We've learned our lesson and waited to reveal the date of the game until the tickets were secured.  </p>

<p>If you have never been on a bus trip, it is a great way to take in a Cubs game.&nbsp; We charter a bus and you don't have to worry about parking or anything.&nbsp; The bus drops us off right at Wrigley Field on Waveland.&nbsp; Your purchase price covers your bus ride up and back, and the ticket to the game.&nbsp; What these bus trips are well-known for is that you are able to drink on the bus en route.&nbsp; We had two guys in the back of the bus polish off a bottle of Jack Daniels before the first bathroom stop (about 90 miles into the trip and keep in mind that the bus pulled out at 8:30am) and there was gallons of Bloody Marys being passed around.  We had a great group last year that enjoyed the company of other Cubs fans and it was an amazing day for a baseball game.   </p>

<p>The date for the <strong>2011 Bus Trip will be May 14th</strong>.&nbsp; It is a very rare Saturday night game at Wrigley and the Cubs will be hosting the San Francisco Giants, who are fresh off their 2010 World Series Championship.&nbsp; If the Cubs can pimp the Yankees vs. Cubs games as Jeter vs. Castro, we can pimp this bus trip as Lincecum vs Castro or Matt Cain vs. Castro.&nbsp; Those match-ups are way more likely to happen, unless Joe Girardi sends Jeter to the bullpen.</p>
<p>I have had quite a few people asking about the purchase of tickets for the bus trip and this is how we are going to do it:&nbsp; First dibs on the seats for this trip go to those that bought tickets for last year's bus trip.&nbsp; If you bought tickets to the 2010 bus trip, you have the opportunity to purchase the same number of seats.&nbsp; The cost for the bus ride and the baseball game will be $90 this year.&nbsp; To reserve your seat, you must pay the deposit ($45) by March 10th.&nbsp; On March 11th, I will announce how many seats are left on the bus and anyone can put down their deposit for a seat.  I will need the remaining amount for the seats by April 10th.  </p>
