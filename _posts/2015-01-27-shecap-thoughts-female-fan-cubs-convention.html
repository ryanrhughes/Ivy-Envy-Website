    Cubs-Tigers series last year. He would like to go back on Undercover Boss. Meanwhile,
    Todd's wife, a French-Canadian hockey fan, really hates the Mets culminating in

I know the guys did their <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/cubs-convention-2015-episode-6-54/" target="_blank">recap podcast</a> on our train ride home, and it was just as much a success as the train's happy hour! Since Tawny (Corey's wife) and I&nbsp;both tagged along at Cubs Convention this year, I thought I would give you a little "shecap" of what that was like.&nbsp;Let me begin by saying I am a legitimate Cubs fan. I didn't marry into this mess; my love for the Cubs has grown over the past thirty ::cough:: plus years. So it wasn't as though Andy had to drag me to convention. I was already on board. I honestly had no idea what to expect. The conferences I have attended in the past are more for creative types, or design trade shows, so nothing sports-related or specific to one brand. I was curious what I would see.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/01/the_big_show.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10877" src="/uploads/2015/01/the_big_show-300x255.png" alt="the_big_show" width="300" height="255" data-id="10877" /></a></p>
<p>Cubs Convention was far larger&nbsp;than I expected. People are pretty interested in this upcoming 2015 season, and they showed that anticipation with their attendance at the Convention. Not sure what the overall amount of tickets sold for the "sold out" event was, but I am not being dramatic when I say they sold about 1,000 too many. For serious. It was more crowded and stinky than the Addison station after a July extra-inning game. We did not have guaranteed access to see the panels we wanted. In some cases, we couldn't even make it into the doorway of the room a&nbsp;session was in.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/01/friendly_confines.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10873" src="/uploads/2015/01/friendly_confines-300x231.png" alt="friendly_confines" width="300" height="231" data-id="10873" /></a><br />
The Convention itself was really incredible as far as what was available to see and do. There was adequate staff and signage, and the programs and conference packs provided were great. Truth is, give me a free koozie and you have my heart. I struck up a conversation with one of the conference staffers who I found out was actually an usher at Wrigley. She was an absolute doll to talk to and sincerely full of questions about how we were enjoying CubsCon and our trip to the city. I pretty much wanted to &nbsp;have her be my aunt&nbsp;after about 20 minutes. The panels that I was able to attend were fantastic, and I am now even more excited for the 2015 season.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/01/goat_check.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-10874" src="/uploads/2015/01/goat_check-300x152.png" alt="goat_check" width="300" height="152" data-id="10874" /></a></p>
<p>The only question I had ahead of time was "will there be a coat check?" CubsCon is in January after all, and we would be traveling there. I emailed the general info email address via cubs.com, and blammo! I had an answer the same day that yes, coat check would&nbsp;be available. We were even able to check our luggage for $10 on Sunday morning when we had checked out of our hotel and headed to the Convention. Some other general FYI for female attendees would be that there were plenty of restrooms&nbsp;with no long lines. I am sure the men's rooms may have been more crowded (but at least there is no trough). For new moms,&nbsp;I did notice there were changing tables and some of the restrooms had a small lobby outside if you had&nbsp;nursing baby or even were in need of a "time-out" spot for a small child.</p>

I was very surprised at how many players and staffers we saw over the weekend just walking the conference floor(s). Keep your eyes open and a Sharpie handy because you just never know who you will run into. We saw plenty of the newer players but I even spotted Demps, Wood, Fergie, and Tom Ricketts among the crowds. Collecting autographs is really not our thing, so we saw very little of those lines but did see the racket outside the hotel anytime a player pulled up or away from the Convention.</p>

We left our kids at home this Convention, but I did have to take a look at what activities were made available for all the "small-sample-sized" Cub fans. <strong>I have to give a huge thumbs up to the Cubs for not compromising on this element of the Convention</strong>. There was a TON for kids to do and see! Even with all of the crowds and jam-packed events, the kids activities were amazing and not crowded. "Clark's Clubhouse" was in a large room of the hotel and there were batting cages, balloon animals, face-painting, coloring stations, pitching games, and a ton more!</p>

I would have been very happy about our son's experience had he joined us for the weekend. We did get to meet Clark the Cub who is already a household name in each of the Ivy Envy homesteads. I was able to bring home lots of Clark freebies, including an arms-length of Clark stickers. You know Clark is a big deal when his sticker earns a a spot on our son's bin of favorite Legos!</p>

I always have a giant "mom-purse" at events like these, but having it does pay off. Bringing your own bottled water and snacks is always a smart choice. There were water coolers on each floor, so it wasn't necessary to buy water. I do admit I did some day-drinking and purchased an $8 beer (or two), but that is really to be expected at any event. The Convention itself spanned 4 floors of the hotel and was not really in the best location to make a quick run outside for a meal or even a beer. Tawny and I did manage to make the short trek out mid-day Saturday for an opportunity to boost the local Chicago economy. By this I mean of course we shopped like crazy for about an hour. There were plenty of dining options within Cubs Convention--even a veggie burger for Tawny and Corey.</p>

Overall we had a pretty great weekend together, and I left the Cubs Convention exhausted and convinced that perhaps it's not the right event for us. Perhaps in a few years Andy and our son can journey back to CubsCon to see the signs and snag the signatures of his favorite players. I see that as a wonderful way to experience the Convention, and I believe it to be evident that the Cubs Organization loves carrying on that tradition. I don't know how many times I heard "I used to come with when I was a kid and now we come and bring ours" throughout the weekend. Many thanks to those who&nbsp;planned this event and to the Cubs Social Media team for the great photobooth (I love a good photobooth). Cubs Convention was full of females, and I am excited to report they weren't all girlfriends in bedazzled Victoria's Secret "Go Cubbies" tank tops. It is a great place to meet other fans and ticketholders.</p>
