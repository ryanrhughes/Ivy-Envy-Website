<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt record this episode as the Darwin Barney Gold Glove announcement comes in.  We look at the  players from the Cubs organization that are participating in the Arizona Fall League.  Corey gives a couple of Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flexing Comments and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
