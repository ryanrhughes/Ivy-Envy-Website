<p>"Congrats on the win, Kevin.&nbsp; Now pack your s--t and get to Pittsburgh.&nbsp; The good news is you won't have to look at Jack Wilson's or Freddy Sanchez's ugly mugs when you get there.&nbsp; The bad news is your team is probably going to suck for quite some time.&nbsp; Enjoy!"</p>
<p>The Cubs got lefties John Grabow and Tom Gorzelanny in exchange for Kevin Hart, Jose Ascanio (I'll miss your goggles, but not your pitching that much), and Josh Harrison, who seemed like quite a spark plug of a player when we went to see the Chiefs.&nbsp; I can see why the Pirates, if they are so interested in young talent, would want him.&nbsp; I wish Grudzielanek and Gorzelanny could jump in a time machine and play for the Cubs at the same time back when Harry Caray was the Cubs' commentator.&nbsp; Maybe we could throw minor leaguer Lee Gronkiewicz in there just for fun too.&nbsp; I love our left-handedness fixation, but doesn't Hendry know that <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071231023506AAcJIB9" target="_blank">the left hand is unclean</a>?&nbsp; And why are right-handers never referred to as "northpaws?"</p>
<p>Speaking of the Pirates, did everyone see <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?content_id=5781471" target="_blank">this bizarre-as-crap play made by Delwyn Young</a> the other day?</p>
<p>Well, the Cubs scored 35 runs in the 4-game series with Houston.&nbsp; Hot damn.&nbsp; The only factor that may kind of bring the room down is that the Astros pitching staff kinda sucks.&nbsp; Still, almost everyone seems to be coming to life offensively, even Fontenot and Bradley from the left side.&nbsp; Fukudome did a ton of damage today as well, and his average is now up to .274.&nbsp; The only other bad news from this home stand is Reed Johnson fracturing his foot after fouling a pitch straight down.&nbsp; Do they make steel-toe baseball cleats?</p>
