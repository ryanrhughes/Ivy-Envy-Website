<p>Artemis, Aslan, Gandalf, and Ted Lilly.&nbsp; All of them can commune with wild animals, but only one has the ability to throw a cliff-hanging curve ball and plow hapless catchers trying to guard the plate.&nbsp; In last night's game against the Diamondbacks, Ted Lilly caught a moth and surreptitiously placed it on Gerald Perry's hat.&nbsp; So add talking to animals to the prodigious list of skills that Ted possesses--check the <a href="http://tedlillyfanclub.blogspot.com/2008/07/ted-lilly-fan-club-announces-class.html" target="_blank">TLFC</a> for more info on all things TL.</p>
<p>I'm so glad I missed most of today's game due to work.&nbsp; As my grandpa would say, "Nelly, bar the door!"&nbsp; Throw some strikes, and hit the damn ball.</p>
