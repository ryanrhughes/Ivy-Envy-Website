  content: Did you happen to ask that guy how much Albert charges for lawn service?
    If he's reasonable I might give him a call. I hate mowing.

  content: "Yeah, Clinton Iowa is a lot like Wrigley Field.  When you get there, the
    first thing you do is look to see if the wind is blowing out.\r\n\r\nJake - by
    the way, if you could ask The Hundley to get in contact with me, I'd appreciate
    it.  corey@ivyenvy.com\r\n\r\nAre you from around these parts, too?"

<p><strong>3:19:15 PM</strong>: About to make the 90 mile trip to Peoria.  Heading down with fellow #Cubs fan and friend of the blog, Ian.</p>
<p><strong>5:44:24 PM</strong>: 10th row is really 5th row.  Right on top of the away dugout.  I'm sure the guys in green can admit Peoria smells better than Clinton.</p>
<p><strong>5:56:22 PM</strong>: Since Kurt couldn't come, in honor of him, the first Ivy Envy flyer I handed out was to a dude wearing a "Pujols mows my lawn" shirt.</p>
<p><strong>6:03:24 PM</strong>: If the radar gun is as accurate as the thermometer it could be interesting.  It says 85 degrees.  Can't be over 75.</p>
<p><strong>6:03:51 PM</strong>: First pitch from Peoria.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:05:53 PM</strong>: No speed on the radar.  Wonder if that is intentional.</p>
<p><strong>6:08:24 PM</strong>: 1-2-3 inning for Zambrano.  2 groundouts and a solid flyout to right.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:10:44 PM</strong>: It's really too bad the Midwest League has DH.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:12:49 PM</strong>: Flaherty comes to the plate to an Eminem song.  Double to straight away center.  2 feet from going out.</p>
<p><strong>6:17:20 PM</strong>: Zambrano is tossing warm up pitches at about 45mph between innings.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:20:40 PM</strong>: Zambrano covered 1st for an out.  A nimble man, he is not.</p>
<p><strong>6:21:55 PM</strong>: 2 k's for Zambrano in the 2nd.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:25:19 PM</strong>: It's really hard to gauge Zambrano's velocity without radar.  He hasn't shown any indication of back pain.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:28:43 PM</strong>: Bad angle on velocity.  Amazing angle on judging check swings.</p>
<p><strong>6:31:58 PM</strong>: My obsession with Michael Brenly's thighs continue.   Tree trunks, I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>6:42:42 PM</strong>: 3rd inning.  Zambrano gives up single, double.  Runners on 2nd and 3rd with one out.  2 k's to end the inning.</p>
<p><strong>6:44:06 PM</strong>: Girl in front of us hit by rifled foul ball.  Helped away by medics.</p>
<p><strong>6:51:00 PM</strong>: Nice to see a game in Peoria.  Came here when I was a kid and saw Mark Grace, Joe Girardi...and I think I saw Palmiero, not sure.</p>
<p><strong>6:55:51 PM</strong>: Unwventful 3rd for Zambrano.  3 hits over 4 innings.  Still doesn't look like he's letting loose on his fastball.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>6:57:05 PM</strong>: Uneventful 4th.  I need to be better texter.</p>
<p><strong>7:09:07 PM</strong>: Zambrano gave up 1 hit in the 5th.  No idea on pitch count.  Another foul ball injury.  Virtually no screen at this place.</p>
<p><strong>7:12:26 PM</strong>: Zambrano is done for the night.  5IP, 4 hits, 0 runs.  #cubs</p>
<p><strong>7:19:16 PM</strong>: O'Brien Field is nice.  View from the outfield berm is nice.</p>
<p><strong>7:23:15 PM</strong>: Archer replaces Zambrano.</p>
<p><strong>7:31:57 PM</strong>: Raining in Peoria...calling it a night</p>
