<p>Like most Cubs fans, our initial reactions to this signing (and even the rumors that the Cubs were interested) were not exactly positive.  We share our initial reservations about the signing and then discuss what we like about the Cubs signing Lackey.  </p>
<p>We talk about Edgar Olmos, the latest Chris Bosio project.  Reports came out this week that Javier Baez will get time in center field in the winter league this off-season.  We talk about the impact that could have on the 2016 Cubs.  </p>
<p>We wrap up the episode by reading some internet muscle flexes.</p>
