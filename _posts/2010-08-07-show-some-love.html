<p>Welcome to "Show Some Love," where periodically we will be balancing out our "Asshat of the Week" by drawing attention to the hardworking players in the game (Cubs or not) who turn in performances any baseball fan could respect and appreciate.&nbsp; This week we show some love to Todd Coffey of the Milwaukee Brewers--</p>

<em>What the heck am I looking at at :08 seconds??</em></p>
<p>It's definitely no secret that Coffey sprints in from the bullpen when called upon.&nbsp; It is this type of energy that has endeared him to Brewers fans, and as Cubs fans, we can appreciate the spirited effort he brings every appearance.&nbsp; Though Coffey isn't exactly one of the elite relievers in the game, he gives it his all to keep the Brewers in the game.&nbsp; His best season was probably 2009, where he appeared in 78 games and maintained a sub-3.00 ERA.&nbsp; Coffey also had to put in his time in the minors--it took about seven years for him to finally make it to a big-league roster.&nbsp; So, though you play for the enemy, you are appreciated, Todd Coffey.</p>
