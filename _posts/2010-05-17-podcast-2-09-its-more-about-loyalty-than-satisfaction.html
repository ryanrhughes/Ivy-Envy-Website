<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy discuss a terrible first half of May for the Cubs, the lack of production from the middle of the line-up and Starlin Casto being showered with boo's in his first game at Wrigley Field.&nbsp; We also consider what Lou Piniella's role in this is and what the future holds for him.&nbsp; We question the validity of the no-hitter thrown by Nick Struck of the Peoria Chiefs.&nbsp; And we read your answers from the Question of the Week.</p>
