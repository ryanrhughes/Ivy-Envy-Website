<p>The Kane County Cougars visited Peoria for a series with the Chiefs this last weekend.  Before Sunday's game, I had the opportunity to speak with Dan Vogelbach and record an interview with him for our podcast.  </p>
<p>Dan Vogelbach is considered the #11 prospect in the Cubs system by Cubs.com.  He was the organization's 2nd round pick in the 2011 draft and he's showcasing his power as he works his way up through the Cubs system.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will post my interview with Cubs #2 prospect, Albert Almora.  Andy and I sat down with Javier Baez last year and you can hear that interview at <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-25-interview-with-cubs-prospect-javier-baez/" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/baezinterview</a>.</p>
