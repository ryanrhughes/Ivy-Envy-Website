<p>I made my second trip to Wrigley this season yesterday to see the Cubs host the Detroit Tigers.  I was pretty excited about the day because I was taking my 5-year old daughter to her first MLB game.  We were both disappointed with the outcome, especially considering the Cubs were facing Justin Verlander and the game was tied into the 7th inning.  </p>
<p>It was a beautiful and sunny day in Wrigleyville.  Despite the fact my daughter didn't get to sing "Go Cubs Go!", which she was really looking forward to, it was a really nice day.  Instead of gushing about my awesome day with my little girl, I'll focus on some negatives.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Comerica Park South</strong></u><br />
Immediately upon arriving in Wrigleyville, it was clear Detroit fans had shown up for this series.  Apparently Eminem or Kid Rock were not on tour because there was Tigers fans everywhere.  In walking around the neighborhood, I guessed that Tigers fans outnumbered Cubs fans 5 to 1.  </p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune estimated that Tigers fans made up 75% of the crowd in Wrigley.  I sat in Aisle 404 and I'd guess that the section was upwards of 80% Tigers fans.  Justin Verlander went for a pre-game jog and the stadium erupted.  When Austin Jackson homered in the 9th to put the Cubs away, Wrigley was as loud as I've ever heard it.  I haven't been to as many Cubs games as some of our readers, but over the last 5 years, I've probably gone to 3-4 games a year (many of which were painful losses), but I'd guess that was the loudest it's been at Wrigley this year.  </p>
<p>While being surrounded by the opponent's fans at Wrigley sounds miserable, it wasn't bad as I expected.  It was sickening to see Wrigley over-run by any other fan base, but the Tigers fans I encountered were friendly and respectful.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Wrigleyville Block Party</u></strong><br />
When I saw Tom Ricketts speak in Peoria last year, he discussed that he would like to make Wrigleyville more of a family-friendly environment.  He said something to the effect of "It's a great place to meet up with your college friends and go to a ball game, but it's not necessarily a place you want to take your kids."  </p>
<p>Since I had my 5-year old with me, I was looking forward to checking out the block party.  My views on things like bouncy-houses and other kids activities have changed in the last few years.  I think I would have made fun of things like that 10 years ago.  When your most family-friendly attraction is a statue of an announcer that died 14 years ago, you're not doing much to bring in the families.  </p>
<p>For some reason, I thought Waveland or Sheffield was blocked off, so we headed back that way.  As it turns out, the block party was in the triangle lot.  As we walked up, I saw a very empty parking lot with some vendor booths set up along the perimeter.  There was a large stage set up and there were girls dressed up and dancing like the Fly Girls from In Living Color.  They were dancing to music that matched their attire and dance moves.  As we walked away, someone joined them on stage to give us a live performance of Vanilla Ice's timeless classic, "Ice Ice Baby".  </p>
<p>When I said the parking lot was empty, it looked like this:<br />

<p>Not like this:<br />

<p>We decided not to go in the gates because the vendor booths looked like corporate "Oh, let me pitch you our service and you can have a foam frisbee".  Apparently there was a booth in there for kids to make signs.  I didn't see it and didn't see any kids holding signs in the ballpark.  I think the block party idea is a good one, but the Cubs definitely need to go back to the drawing board.  As a Cubs fan surrounded by visiting Tigers fans, I found it rather embarrassing.  </p>
<p><strong><u>Field Conditions</u></strong><br />
The weekend concerts at Wrigley Field definitely did some damage on the turf.  I guess I don't care if they do concerts at Wrigley if that means it's funneling more money into the team and what the Cubs are able to do over the next few years.  But you would think with all the guest crowds the Cubs are hosting this year, you'd want that field to look spectacular.  </p>
