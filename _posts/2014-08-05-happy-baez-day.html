  content: 1:40am start to the game... :-( I'm hoping there's not a lot of internet
    traffic about this game, so I can watch it on catch-up...

<p>There hasn't been much for Cubs fans to get excited about these last few years, so let's take time to celebrate the arrival of one of the top prospects in baseball, Javier Baez.  Baez will make his major league debut tonight in Colorado.  </p>
<p>We know there is no guarantee with prospects and it's not only possible, but probably likely that Javier Baez will struggle in the final two months of the 2014 season.  This rebuild is coming together though and this is a big first step.  Things are going to move fairly quickly now.  Soler will probably come up in September, the Cubs will have an active off-season and Kris Bryant should join the Cubs a few months into next season. </p>
<p>You deserve to feel happy about this.  Don't feel bad and wish the Cubs fans around you Happy Baez Day.  </p>
<p>If you are local to the Quad Cities and west-central Illinois, be sure to listen to WYEC 93.9 FM this morning.  I will on the air between 11am and 12, talking Baez and Cubs baseball with Sean Patrick.  </p>
<p>You can listen to the audio from this interview here:  <a href="http://www.quadcitydailynews.com/news/details.cfm?clientid=20&id=138430#.U-Ei8oBdUjM" target="_blank">Mid Morning in the Cities</a>.  </p>
