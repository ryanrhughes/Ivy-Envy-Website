excerpt: Well, the Cubs have been playing pretty good baseball, so what can we whine
  about, damnit?&nbsp; These are just not the Cubs we've come to know and love.&nbsp;
  When the Pirates tied up the game in the eighth inning on Sunday, the old Cubs would've
  rolled over into "steamrollme" position.&nbsp; However, this year's team responded
  to the Pirates' equalizer with back-to-back homeruns in the bottom of the eighth
  to put the Cubs ahead for good.&nbsp; I don't think Reed Johnson's contributions
  to this team can be overstated.&nbsp; He has been pretty clutch.

<p>Well, the Cubs have been playing pretty good baseball, so what can we whine about, damnit?&nbsp; These are just not the Cubs we've come to know and love.&nbsp; When the Pirates tied up the game in the eighth inning on Sunday, the old Cubs would've rolled over into "steamrollme" position.&nbsp; However, this year's team responded to the Pirates' equalizer with back-to-back homeruns in the bottom of the eighth to put the Cubs ahead for good.&nbsp; I don't think Reed Johnson's contributions to this team can be overstated.&nbsp; He has been pretty clutch.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-174"></a></p>
<p>With all that said, we still have games like tonight's game and Friday's game in which the Cubs seem to be swinging the ice bat.&nbsp; These games seem to be more rare than they used to be, but even more baffling is that many of these cold nights at the plate are against pitching that should be more-than-hittable for the Cubs.&nbsp; Moehler's ERA is over 4 for the season, so this team should be jumping all over him, right?&nbsp; I know it is very unrealistic to expect them to hit lights-out every night, but getting shutout shouldn't happen.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I found something to whine about.</p>
<p>Kerry Wood might be back on Tuesday.&nbsp; I will withold my enthusiasm on that news--any pitcher out for that long has to have some rust.</p>
