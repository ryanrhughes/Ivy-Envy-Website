  For the first time since that infamous year of 1908, the Cubs have back-to-back

  content: It goes back down to 25 and only players that were on the roster prior
    to August 31st can be on the playoff roster.

  content: I think Marquis would be valuable on the roster.  He can pitch, he can
    pinch-run, he can use a bat....he could be handy late in the game when the bench
    gets sparse.

  content: "Let's throw this up here for the sake of argument.  Several of the players
    on this list are players I wouldn't take, but I think they will take.  I wouldn't
    include Howry, for example, but I think they will take him.  I picked Marshall
    as the left-handed specialist (especially over Cotts).  Hoffpauir and Fukudome
    seems like a little much.\n\n1.\tSoto\n2.\tLee\n3.\tDeRosa\n4.\tTheriot\n5.\tRamirez\n6.\tSoriano\n7.\tEdmonds\n8.\tFukudome\n9.\tBlanco\n10.\tJohnson\n11.\tZambrano\n12.\tLilly\n13.\tDempster\n14.\tHarden\n15.\tMarquis\n16.\tWood\n17.\tMarmol\n18.\tWard\n19.\tHowry\n20.\tSamardzija\n21.\tMarshall\n22.\tGaudin\n23.\tCedeno\n24.\tFontenot\n25.\tHoffpauir"

  content: Well, they need a left-handed at bat.  Overall, I'd rather see Fukudome
    on the roster rather than Ward.  Fukudome's defensive skills can literally win
    a ballgame for them.  I see them both on your list and that's cool with me.  I
    don't see any glaring omissions from your list.

  content: You could drop Marquis to free up a spot since they don't really need 5
    starters. Unless they want him for long relief.

<p>Enjoy it, Cubs fans.&nbsp; For the first time since that infamous year of 1908, the Cubs have back-to-back division championships.&nbsp; This team is probably the best and most complete group of Cubs in my lifetime.&nbsp; Until the last few weeks, they have been the most consistent Cubs team in my lifetime.&nbsp; Throughout this season, if one player was down, another player was hot.&nbsp; Seeing as how the whole team went cold last year in the playoffs, that was the one thing that made me more comfortable with this team.&nbsp; Of course, then they went on a skid and took a lot of my confidence away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I will put those fears away for a day.&nbsp; All that matters right now is that the Brewers, and even more importantly, the Cardinals don't own this division.&nbsp; The Chicago Cubs do.&nbsp; It makes it a little more sweet that we beat the Cardinals to clinch the division.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's time to get some rest for guys like Soto.&nbsp; It's time for Fukudome to <a id="more"></a><a id="more-234"></a>figure out how to hit a ball on the outside third of the plate.&nbsp; It seems to me like it would be a very fine line that Lou has to walk with making sure guys get rest, but keeping them fresh enough that they don't enter the playoffs rusty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manstrength and I had a discussion this week with Ivy Envy member, Paul (but he's never posted).&nbsp; We were discussing whether or not Fukudome would be on the roster for the playoffs.&nbsp; Manstrength and I both believe he's got to be there for his defensive skills.&nbsp; I wouldn't be surprised if Fukudome doesn't come back to the Cubs or the United States next year.&nbsp; Here's your chance to chime in.&nbsp; What do you think of Fukudome's post-season chances?</p>
<p>Now we wait for things to pan out to see who we are playing in the playoffs.&nbsp; I don't have any preference.&nbsp; I'm one of "those" Cubs fans, so every team scares me.&nbsp; But I have to put those pessimistic feelings aside.&nbsp; I have a whole week to celebrate this division crown.</p>
