<p>I'm sure you've heard by now that Carlos Zambrano will be pitching for Caribes de Anzoategui, a team from Puerta La Cruz, Venezuela in the Venezuelan Winter League.  Zambrano has not pitched since his little "display" in Atlanta on August 12th.  </p>
<p>The Zambrano situation will be one of the most important and interesting that Epstein and Hoyer will face in their first few months with the Cubs.  If the Cubs choose to unload Zambrano, they will probably have to eat a good chunk of his $18 million owed for 2012, and possibly $19.4 million for 2013 if Zambrano finishes in the top 4 in Cy Young voting in 2012.  </p>
<p>Epstein says he has spoken with Zambrano's agent and people within the organization that are familiar with Z and said that those conversations were "enlightening".  I imagine Epstein used that term for for one (or a combination) of the following reasons:</p>
<p><em>1.  Epstein always knew Zambrano was crazy, but now he realizes how crazy he really is.<br />
2.  Epstein heard Zambrano was crazy, but after a little research, he realizes that Paul Sullivan is full of it.<br />
3.  Epstein finds that Jim Hendry made monumental mistakes and ran an organization that was in disarray.  He had a hunch all along, but digging into the Z situation showed him how messed up everything was/is.  That "enlightening" statement maybe had more to do with the organization than Zambrano.<br />
</em><br />
So Zambrano heads to Venezuela and the Cubs are ok with this.  From their perspective, it's a risk that's probably worth taking.  Zambrano could get injured while pitching, but what is more likely is that he will go down there and do well, driving up his value.  </p>
<p>As we speak, Ivy Envy has someone en route to Puerta La Cruz, Venezuela.  Ivy Envy reader/uncle, Ken Shook, is heading to Venezuela and plans to attempt to see Zambrano and report back to us what he sees.  It appears that Zambrano's first game will be Sunday and hopefully Ken will be in the crowd.  It's not clear how much control Ken will have over his schedule, so we can't give any specifics on what he will be covering, but hopefully he can get to a game or two.  Personally, I'm interested to see photos of the ballparks down there.  </p>
<p>So stay tuned to our website and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ivy-envy/id306933992" target="_blank">the podcast</a> for whatever Ken sends back up this way.  </p>
