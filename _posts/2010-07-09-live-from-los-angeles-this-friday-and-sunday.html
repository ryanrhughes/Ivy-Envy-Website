<p>If you missed it, I did some live commentary on the Cubs vs. Diamondbacks games from Phoenix via Twitter.&nbsp; When I return to the Quad Cities, I will post photos and some thoughts on those games.</p>
<p>I will be at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles for today's (Friday) game and Sunday's Cubs vs. Dodgers games.&nbsp; I really enjoyed the interaction on Twitter with some of our followers during the games in Phoenix and look forward to more of it this weekend.</p>
