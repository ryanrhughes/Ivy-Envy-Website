<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the moves the Chicago Cubs have made in the last week.  The Cubs bring in Japanese closer Fujikawa.  On paper, he's been dominant in Japan and 2013 should show us what we can expect from him in Major League Baseball.  We consider what this move means for Carlos Marmol.  What will the roles of these two pitchers be?</p>
<p>One aspect of baseball on the north side that Fujikawa will have to adjust to is the lack of intro music when pitchers come out of the bullpen.  You'll want to hear the song Fujikawa came out of the bullpen to with the Hanshin Tigers.</p>
<p>The Cubs add outfielder Nate Schierholtz.  Schierholtz will most likely play in right field every day, with David DeJesus moving to center.  Kurt looks at the Rule 5 draft and tells about the additions and subtractions for the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We have three Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flexes for you this week.  Then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
