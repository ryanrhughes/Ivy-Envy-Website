<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss the Cubs free agent signing of Scott Baker.  Is this the type of free agent signing we can expect in this off-season?  The Cubs come up short on the bidding war for Ryu Hyun-Jin.  Should Cubs fans be concerned when the Cubs are unable to secure players in these situations?  </p>
<p>We check in with the players in the Cubs organization that are playing in the Arizona Fall League one last time.  Kurt shows us some Cubs.com Comment Internet Muscle Flexing and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest:</p>
