<p>Goes to the Rockies' mascot, Dinger.&nbsp; This "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_mascots#Dinger" target="_blank">anthropomorphic purple triceratops</a>" could be seen in the seats right behind home plate during the bottom of the ninth on Saturday.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was rubbing his belly and doing his best to distract Kevin Gregg from his efforts to save the game for the Cubs, and lord knows Gregg doesn't need distractions.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe I'm being a little harsh... the Wikipedia article goes on to talk about Dinger visiting sick kids and promoting literacy.&nbsp; Keep doing good deeds and trying to generate that elusive home field advantage and identity for your team.&nbsp; I don't hate you nearly as much as I do <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1039" target="_blank">the Sox fan who wore the goat mask</a> during the "Crosstown Classic."</p>
