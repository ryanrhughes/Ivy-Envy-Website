<p>In the last few years, I have not hidden my love for Matt Murton.&nbsp; It dawned on me tonight that I hadn't checked up on him since the end of last season.&nbsp; From April - October, "Matt Murton" may be my most Google'd term on this computer.&nbsp; I start at his Wikipedia page and plan to continue to Baseball-Reference to swoon over his average production.</p>
<p>I was stunned to read this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Matthew Henry Murton</strong> (born October 3, 1981, in <a title="Fort Lauderdale, Florida" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale,_Florida">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>) is an <a title="Outfielder" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder">outfielder</a> for the <a title="Hanshin Tigers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshin_Tigers">Hanshin Tigers</a> of <a title="Nippon Professional Baseball" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Professional_Baseball">Nippon Professional Baseball</a> in Japan.</blockquote><br />
This happened in December and because I was not in the mood to read about the Cubs, I missed on <a href="http://thundermatt.com/2009/12/turning-japanese.html">Thunder Matt's Saloon</a>.&nbsp; I looked over the Tigers' roster and the only name I recognized was Kenji Johjima.</p>
<p>I feel bad for my fellow red-head.&nbsp; Remember how sorry we felt for Fukudome when he first came over?&nbsp; He was a stranger in a foreign land unable to communicate.&nbsp; Murton's in the same spot and he needs my support.&nbsp; So I decide to buy a Hanshin Tigers hat.&nbsp; Maybe somehow the word would get to Matt that someone in Illinois bought a Hanshin hat, clearly to show their support.&nbsp; It wasn't difficult to find a Hanshin hat.&nbsp; Nor was it difficult to decide not to spend <a href="http://www.yakyushop.com/store/product/50/Hanshin-Tigers-New-Era-Fitted-Cap-%28Black%29">$77 for a baseball hat.</a></p>
