<p>While Theo Epstein has made it clear the Cubs aren't real interested in spending a ton of money in the free agent, he has taken his "& Co." (Jed Hoyer) down to the Dominican Republic to check out Cuban defector Yoennis Cespedes.  </p>
<p>The 26 year old outfielder is being inspected by many teams and he's expected to secure between $35 and $50 million.  It's far too early to speculate on if the Cubs would sign Cespedes and if they did, what that means for players like Marlon Byrd, Brett Jackson and Tony Campana (sorry, I had to throw the kid a bone).  </p>
<p>In his showcase video, Cespedes appears to be <del datetime="2011-11-23T13:56:53+00:00">superhuman</del> major league ready.  I mentioned the video on this week's podcast, so I wanted to share it on the site.  </p>
<p>This video puts Joey Gathright and his car-jumping to shame.<br />
