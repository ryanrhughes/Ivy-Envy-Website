<p>In March, Cuban defector Gerardo Concepcion signed with the Chicago Cubs and added him to the 40-man roster.  The Cubs have called the 20-year old LHP up to Peoria.  Concepcion will take the mound on Wednesday in Lake County for the Chiefs.  </p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Concepcion, he was the Cuban National Series Rookie of the Year in 2011.  He defected from Cuba when in Rotterdam, Netherlands with the Cuban national team, playing in the World Port Tournament.  </p>
<p>Joe Martin covered Spring Training for us this year and had the opportunity to speak with Concepcion about his comfort level with the Cubs organization.  Check out that <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6891" target="_blank">blog post here</a>.  </p>
