<p>We pause at the All Star Break to reflect on the first half of the 2013 season and look ahead to the final 2 1/2 months.  It's been a pretty eventful first half of the season, especially in regards to the roster.  We talk about some recent moves the Cubs have made and then assess the team's performance to this point.  What players have surprised us?  Who stands out?  What is the front office trying to do and is it working?</p>
<p>We make a few predictions for the second half of the season and answer some listener questions.  We have two scary stats of the week for you and then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
