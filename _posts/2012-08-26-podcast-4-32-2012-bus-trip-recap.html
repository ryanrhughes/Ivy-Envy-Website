  content: I haven't listened yet, but you say "low key and off the cuff" like that's
    not the way Ivy Envy always rolls. Now I really have to listen so I can see what
    a non-professional Ivy Envy podcast sounds like. Maybe the whole house falls down
    instead of some bobble heads? Maybe you actually down 12 Old Styles instead of
    the one that sits there for your interview? Maybe the children do the podcast
    instead of just being heard in the background?

  content: Too much preparation takes the truth out of the situation. (I just made
    that up and you can quote me) Seriously, if you guys sounded like the other talking
    heads, I would stop downloading the podcasts. Nobody needs another "expert." We
    need other die-hard crazies to confirm our suspicions. Keep it up.

<p>In this low-key and off-the-cuff episode, Andy, Corey and Kurt describe yesterday's Ivy Envy Bus Trip to see the Cubs play the Rockies at Wrigley.  We comment on the Cubs potentially pulling out of Peoria and reportedly relocating their Midwest League affiliation to Kane County.  </p>
<p>We discuss some listener suggested topics and choose a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
