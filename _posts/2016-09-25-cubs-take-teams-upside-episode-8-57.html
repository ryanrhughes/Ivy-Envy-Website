Friend of the podcast, Katie Day has released a new song for the 2016 Cubs Post-Season.  On this episode, we bring Katie on the podcast to talk about the pressure of following up "By the Lakeside" and creating a completely different sounding song in "We Got the Fire".  We think you'll really enjoy this conversation.</p>
<p>We also continue to look at the playoff rosters and talk about some of the players we thought wouldn't make the roster, but now it appears that they have a good chance.  One example is Miguel Montero, who helped Jake Arrieta get back to form on Friday.  </p>
