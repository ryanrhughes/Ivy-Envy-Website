excerpt: Tomorrow night we embark on the 2nd half, and it looks like Ted Lilly will
  get a chance to make up for his last start in which he allowed 4 ER and only lasted
  2.2 innings.&nbsp; I am excited for the rest of this season.&nbsp; Seeing the Cubs
  pitchers do well against the best of the AL in the All-Star Game was encouraging.

<p>Tomorrow night we embark on the 2nd half, and it looks like Ted Lilly will get a chance to make up for his last start in which he allowed 4 ER and only lasted 2.2 innings.&nbsp; I am excited for the rest of this season.&nbsp; Seeing the Cubs pitchers do well against the best of the AL in the All-Star Game was encouraging.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-129"></a></p>
<p>Speaking of the All-Star Game, Matt Veto wrote a <a href="http://www.qconline.com/bloggers/sports/?p=213" target="_blank">great post</a> detailing how attaching home field advantage to an All-Star Game victory made people engaged in the game in a bad way.&nbsp; I found myself being ticked off at Uggla as well; this game should be a relaxing experience for the players and the fans.&nbsp; Just give home field advantage to the team with the best record.</p>
<p>Since we didn't get to see Wood pitch in the All-Star Game, let's look back to his 20 K game.</p>
