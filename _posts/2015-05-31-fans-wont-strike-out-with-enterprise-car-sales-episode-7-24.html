<p><a href="/uploads/2014/04/IvyEnvy_web_1600x1600.jpg"><img data-id="9757"  src="/uploads/2014/04/IvyEnvy_web_1600x1600-300x300.jpg" alt="IvyEnvy_web_1600x1600" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9757" /></a>As we wrap up the month of May and head into June, we discuss our thoughts on where this team is.  This last week was not especially positive, but we still find positives to take away from it. </p>
<p>The MLB trade rumors are starting to fly around.  The last couple of seasons, the Cubs were involved with a lot of rumors because they were sellers.  We're already seeing rumors about the Cubs' interest in certain players, mainly Zobrist and Soriano.  We discuss these potential trades.  </p>
<p>Carl Edwards Jr. was promoted from Double-A Tennessee to Triple-A Iowa and it sure appears that Edwards is on the fast track to the Cubs bullpen.  </p>
<p>We answer several listener questions on various topics, including where we came up with the name "Ivy Envy".  Kurt gives us a scary stat of the week...one that is especially scary considering how much the Cubs have used their bench this season.</p>
<p>We wrap up the episode with some Internet Muscle Flexes. One of which is so bad, the person is awarded the "Asshat of the Week".  </p>
<p>This upcoming Saturday night is our Iowa Cubs Meet-up.  If you'd like to join us, email corey@ivyenvy.com or tweet at @IvyEnvy.  We'll be meeting at El Bait Shop (near Principal Park in Des Moines) at around 3pm.  On-field batting practice?  Dairy Night?  We're there.  </p>
