    this year is an anomaly for him.  God, I love Elias."

<p>A little less than a month ago, I shared what I considered to be <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1200">the scariest stat of the 2009 season</a>.&nbsp; It's only gotten worse for Miles.&nbsp; He has played in about half of the Cubs games this year, 64 games.&nbsp; Before this season, Miles was averaging about 34 RBI's in a season and his career batting average is .281.</p>
<p>I can't help but wonder if Miles didn't come up from St. Louis to help destroy this team from the inside out.&nbsp; Miles is now batting .174, and he bumped up his RBI total to 5.&nbsp; He got his 5th RBI the day after I wrote the first post about him.&nbsp; Obviously, what I wrote was used as bulliten board material and it motivated him to drive a run in.</p>
<p>Now, a season batting average of .174 and 5 RBI's is scary, but they aren't the scariest.&nbsp; Since Miles returned from the DL in early August, he has a batting average of .038.&nbsp; He has one base hit in 26 plate appearances.&nbsp; Sounds to me like a guy worth investing 2 years and $4.9 million in.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idQmNjMICnA">It looks like Elias got his wish.</a></p>
