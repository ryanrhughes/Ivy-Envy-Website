<p>As we sat down to record <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7698" target="_blank">Episode 4.28 of the Ivy Envy Podcast</a> Monday night, we wondered if Theo and Jed would allow the trade deadline to pass today without making any moves. Any inactivity from the Cubs this year would be quite different than the inactivity of Jim Hendry. If the Cubs were not offered anything of value in return, they really had nothing to gain by trading the pieces they had out on the table.</p>
<p>When we entered the second half of the podcast episode, the Cubs dugout was full of hugs, and we stayed current with the happenings via Twitter and faithful listener, DeRose. More details came out after Monday's game and activity continued throughout the day today. Here's a rundown of the Cubs moves at the 2012 trade deadline.</p>
<p><em><strong>Braves receive: Paul Maholm and Reed Johnson</strong><br />
<strong>Cubs receive: Arodys Vizcaino and Jaye Chapman</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Paul Maholm</strong> was widely considered the third most attractive starter that the Cubs would be willing to part with. I enjoyed watching Maholm pitch with the Pirates and was happy to see him be the first real Cubs lefty starter since Ted Lilly. Maholm got off to a rough start in 2012, giving up 6 ER in each of his first two starts. Maholm turned things around, and in the last seven games, he is 5-0. He has not given up more than one earned run in any of the 7 games and he's allowed just one home run in the last 55 innings. Maholm is a solid lefty and the fact the Cubs signed him to a one-year deal with an option for next year, made him disposable and a more valuable piece than he probably was six weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Reed Johnson</strong> has become a fan favorite and spent four of the last five years with the Cubs after being cut by the Blue Jays. We all love his hustle and effort. The Cubs front office has obviously been putting Johnson on display and giving him some good playing time. Johnson has shown that he is a very reliable pinch-hitter. He's hitting .302/.355/.444 with three home runs and 16 RBI in 76 games played this season. Of those 76 games, he's only started 34 of them. A proven pinch-hitter and defensive substitute is very valuable to a playoff contending team. Don't be surprised if you see Reed Johnson in Mesa in 2013. He's cheap, plays hard and could bring another prospect July 31, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Maholm Replacement:</strong> The Cubs don't have anyone to step up, from any level of their minor league system. The most logical replacement would be Casey Coleman. He has pitched in relief in 16 games for the Cubs this year and has an ERA of 7.32. He started 17 games in 2011 and had a 3-9 record with a 6.62 ERA.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Reed Johnson Replacement:</strong> Initially, the reports were that Brett Jackson was pulled from Monday evening's Iowa Cubs game and called up to the Cubs. <a href="http://twitter.com/thekapman" target="_blank">David Kaplan tweeted</a> today that he spoke with Jackson and he will remain with Iowa and was just pulled in a double-switch. I think it's more likely that Dave Sappelt will get the call from Iowa. Sappelt came over from the Reds in the Sean Marshall trade. The 25-year old has 38 games of big league experience with the Reds. Sappelt has been with Iowa all season. He got off to a slow start, but is batting .300 in the month of July. I think bringing up Sappelt gives Jackson some more time in AAA. Jackson is batting .253 on the season and only .217 since the All-Star Break. There is no reason to bring up one of your top prospects when they are struggling at AAA.</p>
<p><strong>Arodys Vizcaino</strong> is a hard-throwing right-handed pitcher from the Dominican Republic. He was signed by the Yankees in 2007 and traded to the Braves in 2009. He made his MLB debut in 2011 and pitched in 17 games for the Braves, posting a 4.67 ERA. Vizcaino is only 21 years old and was ranked by Baseball America as the #2 prospect in the Braves organization. He is projected as a reliever and possibly a closer, if he can control his fastball, which is clocked at 94-97. He mixes in a low 80s curveball with a big break. Vizcaino has not pitched in 2012 as he underwent Tommy John surgery during Spring Training. He should be ready to start throwing in the Spring and it'll be interesting to see how his velocity has been impacted.</p>
<p><strong>Jaye Chapman</strong> is a 25-year-old right handed pitcher that was drafted in the 16th round of the 2005 draft by the Braves. Chapman has pitched in relief at the AAA level for the Braves in 2012 and is 3-6 with a 3.52 ERA. Chapman throws an 87-89mph fastball and he has a good change-up. When a guy is throwing fastballs at that speed, control determines success and Chapman keeps the ball down.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Vizcaino:</strong> We'll have to wait until Spring to see how he responds to Tommy John surgery. I'd guess he will be with Iowa when he's ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Chapman:</strong> While he is probably not ready for the big leagues, the Cubs are very weak in their system with pitching. I'm guessing Chapman will go to Iowa and then he'll make his way up to the Cubs before the end of the 2012 season.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rangers receive: Geovany Soto</strong><br />
<strong>Cubs receive: Jacob Brigham</strong> and player to be named later (or cash)</em></p>
<p><strong>Geovany Soto</strong> started his career with the Cubs very strong. He was an All-Star and the NL Rookie of the Year in 2008. It was all downhill from there. Soto was never able to match his .285 23HR 86RBI rookie numbers. Geo has been on an every-other-year track. 2012 should have been a good season and he's on pace for career lows. Soto leaves the Cubs batting .199 with 6HR and just 14RBIs on the season. Steve Clevenger was named Soto's backup in Spring Training and both he and Welington Castillo will be able to produce better numbers than Geo has this year.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Catcher Position:</strong> I think Clevenger and Castillo will probably split time evenly over the next month. One of them will establish himself as the starter.</p>
<p>In return, the Cubs receive <strong>Jacob Brigham</strong>. The now 24-year-old was drafted by the Rangers in the 6th round of the 2006 draft. Brigham has spent the last two seasons in AA in the Rangers organization. He's a .500 pitcher in AA and this year, has an ERA of 4.28 and a 2.5 k/bb rate. The Rangers minor league system has a lot of good pitching and Brigham was buried in the middle of it. He was expected to make it to AAA later this year, or to start 2013, which means he'll probably be one of the top pitchers in the Cubs minor league system.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Jacob Brigham:</strong> The Cubs will send him to AA Tennessee to make the transition a little easier and then move him up to Iowa before the end of the season.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rangers receive: Ryan Dempster<br />
Cubs receive: Kyle Hendricks and Christian Villanueva</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Ryan Dempster</strong> was the most attractive trade piece the Cubs had this year. It appeared that the Cubs had worked out a deal with the Atlanta Braves that would have brought Randall Delgado to the Cubs. Apparently the timing wasn't right for Dempster and he exercised his right to reject the trade. It was at that point that Dempster publicly said he wanted to go to the Dodgers, which took a lot of bargaining strength away from Epstein, Hoyer, and the Cubs. Dempster has been incredible this season. In 16 starts, he is 5-5 with an incredible 2.25 ERA. After 9 seasons with the Cubs, Dempster became a cornerstone of the team on and off the field. He now leaves the city with a different fan perception than he probably would have if he would have accepted the Braves trade last week. Some think the Cubs could go after Dempster in the off-season. I don't see the happening, regardless of the state of the relationship between the Cubs front office and Dempster.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Ryan Dempster Replacement:</strong> See "Uneducated Guess on Paul Maholm Replacement". Casey Coleman will get the start tonight. Rodrigo Lopez hasn't pitched well in Iowa this year (2-5, 5.28), but he has big league experience. Randy Wells and Chris Volstad could come up. The lack of pitching in the organization will become very obvious over the next few months with the departure of Dempster and Maholm. It will probably be a patch-work situation for the Cubs in regards to pitching for the rest of 2012. Germano, Wells, Coleman, Volstad....yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Christian Hendricks</strong> was drafted by the Angels in the 39th round in 2008 and chose to go to Dartmouth College. He was drafted by the Rangers in the 8th round of the 2011 draft. He has spent the 2012 in High-A Myrtle Beach. He has a 5-8 record with a 2.82 ERA. His fastball is 87-89mph, and he throws a four-seam and two-seam fastball, as well as a changeup, curveball, and slider. In 130.2 innings, he has struck out 112 and walked just 15.</p>
<p>To start the 2012 season, 21-year old <strong>Christian Villanueva</strong> was ranked as the #9 prospect in the Rangers organization and #100 on the pre-season Baseball America top 100 prospect list. Villanueva has also been at High-A Myrtle Beach. On the season, he is batting .285/.356/.421 with 10 HR and 59 RBIs.</p>
<p><strong>Uneducated Guess on Hendricks and Villanueva:</strong> I think both of these guys will start with Daytona and move up to Tennessee before the end of the season. I don't know why the Cubs would start them at the next level, and I don't see any reason to move them down to Peoria.</p>
