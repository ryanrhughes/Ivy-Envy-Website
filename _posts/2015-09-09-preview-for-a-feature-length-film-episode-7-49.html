<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On the last episode of the podcast, we didn't have a lot of hope for this series with the Cardinals in St. Louis.  Other than Wednesdays game, the pitching match-ups weren't favorable for the Cubs.  </p>
<p>However, Cubs batters knocked Cardinals pitching around all over the place and the Cubs won the series 2-1.  On this episode, we talk about that series and continue looking ahead to the playoffs and who the Cubs could face, if they get there.  </p>
