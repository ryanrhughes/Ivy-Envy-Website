  content: Great pod, but I thought there was one aspect of the 1989 vs. 2015 season
    debate that should have come up.&nbsp; Experiencing the season with Harry &amp;
    Steve on play by play impacted the "magic" of the team.&nbsp; I would have loved
    to hear Harry/Steve do the 2015 season and Pat &amp; Ron on the radio.

Michael from Galesburg voiced his opposition immediately.  </p>
<p>Since the last week was fairly uneventful in the land of the Cubs, we decided to invite Michael and his podcast co-host, Lawrence onto the podcast.  Michael and Lawrence do The Awesome 80's Podcast, so you can understand why the '89 Cubs team holds a special place in Michael's heart.  </p>
<p>What you'll hear is a wandering conversation about 80's baseball movies, the Cubs in the 80's, comparing the '89 team to the '15 team, some references to '98 and '03, and a side conversation about the history of Pekin High School.  </p>
