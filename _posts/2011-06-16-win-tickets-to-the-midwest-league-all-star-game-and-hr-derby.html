Our hometown QC River Bandits (Cardinals affiliate) are hosting the 2011 Midwest League All-Star Game festivities and we'll be giving tickets away to the All-Star Game and Homerun Derby. &nbsp;Greg Rohan will represent the Peoria Chiefs for the Western Division. &nbsp;Rohan was chosen because to participate in the Homerun Derby because he is leading the Midwest with a .341 batting average. &nbsp;The Homerun Derby will take place at 7pm on Monday.</p>
<p>Seven Peoria Chiefs were selected to represent the Western Division in Tuesday night's All-Star Game. &nbsp; Matt Szczur, Greg Rohan and Pierre LePage will be starting in the game. &nbsp;Micah Gibbs, Richard Jones, Austin Kirk and Elliot Soto will be reserves in the game.</p>
<p>You can win tickets to these events by "liking" our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946?ref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and on Friday morning, we'll announce how you can win. &nbsp;This is a great opportunity to see the best of the Midwest League in one game. &nbsp;Don't miss them when they're right in your backyard.</p>
