The Cubs had an off-day on Monday and are playing late games on the west coast.  This episode was recorded before the Cubs/Padres game on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>Since we don't have a lot of game action to talk about on this episode, we instead focus on the prospects.  Since we are a month and a half into the season, we look at how the top 10 prospects in the Cubs system are doing this season.  </p>
