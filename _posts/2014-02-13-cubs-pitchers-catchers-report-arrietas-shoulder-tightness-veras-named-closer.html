<p><center><a href="/uploads/2014/02/arrieta.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/02/arrieta-300x168.jpg" alt="Jake Arrieta" width="300" height="168" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8879" /></a></center>The Cubs' pitchers and catchers have officially reported to Mesa for the beginning of Spring Training and the 2014 MLB season. &nbsp;It seems that injuries are inevitable in Spring Training. &nbsp;Whether it's Darwin Barney running into a piece of concrete during the last game of Spring Training last season, or Jake Arrieta's shoulder setback here to start the 2014 season.</p>
<p>Yep, the player we assumed would be the Cubs #4 starter is <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/chi-chicago-cubs-jake-arrieta-shoulder-20140213,0,2825855.story" target="_blank">potentially not going to start the season in the rotation</a>. &nbsp;Arrieta experienced tightness in his shoulder over the winter and the Cubs plan to take it easy with getting him up to speed this spring. &nbsp;You would expect that kind of language used on the first day of Spring Training, especially from a team that is clearly not going to compete this season and has depth in the bullpen to fill in the back end of the bullpen if Arrieta is not ready to go when the season starts. &nbsp;Chris Rusin, Carlos Villanueva or potentially the newly acquired (and avid fisherman) James McDonald could fill in.</p>
<p>In less surprising news from Mesa today, Jose Veras was officially <a href="http://voices.suntimes.com/sports/jose-veras-named-cubs-closer-by-new-manager/" target="_blank">named the closer for the 2014 Cubs</a>. &nbsp;Veras was given a 1-year, $4 mil deal (with club option) in the offseason and I'd assume Strop will become the set-up man, although Renteria indicated no other bullpen assignments had been decided. &nbsp;I understand that there's lots of speculation on these things in Spring Training and managers like to push players and let them compete against others for positions. &nbsp;But if Veras was brought in to close, then name him the closer and move on.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to hear what's going on out there in Mesa and see some great photos of the action, I'd strong suggest you pay attention to <a href="http://boysofspring.com/" target="_blank">Boys of Spring</a>.  Tim does a great job with that site and if you've been listening to our podcast for a while, you know he's a great guy, too.  </p>
