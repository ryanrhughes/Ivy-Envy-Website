  content: Sandberg has annoyed me in the last few weeks.  I should get off my ass
    formulate my thoughts into a post.

<p>I think we all knew it was coming. Once Ryno knew he wouldn't be the manager of the big-league Cubs he would be seeking other opportunities. I'm a little fearful of the&nbsp;possibility&nbsp;that once he's gone, he's gone. I am hopeful that if the Cubs' job opens again and Sandberg is still a viable candidate that it won't take a lot of convincing to get him back in Chicago.</p>
<p>A Sun-Times article said, "Asked specifically about his willingness to return to the organization, he called it ''hypothetical'' but seemed to leave little room for that possibility."</p>
<p>With the Brewers announcing Ron Roenicke as their new guy, only the Mets and Pirates are without a manager. The Pirates are down to Clint Hurdle and Jeff Banister so that job is as good as gone. It seems like the Pirates have been waiting for Hurdle, the Rangers hitting coach, to finish the World Series so they can make it official. It seems just as unlikely that Sandberg would get the Mets job. He hasn't been tagged as a candidate by the mainstream media, but there is plenty of buzz in the Mets blog world about him. I think it would be a horrible first job for him, but maybe good practice for a future Cubs job. Take over a team that drastically underperforms in relation to its ridiculous payroll.</p>
<p>I think he'll get a job on a major league staff, perhaps as a hitting coach, bench coach, etc. Wherever he ends up, I wish him luck and hope that someday he'll be back in Cubbie blue.</p>
