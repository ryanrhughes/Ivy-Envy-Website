<p>We wrap up the 2011 season with some of your responses from a few questions we posed to you.  It was a pretty eventful season for the Cubs and looking ahead to the 2012 season, there are a lot of aspects of the organization up in the air.</p>
<p>This episode is the last of our regular season episodes.  Unless a major story breaks, we will be taking a week off from recording the podcast.  The off-season episodes will be shorter than the regular season episodes and they'll be recorded and released Tuesday nights.  </p>
<p>We'd like to thank you, the loyal listeners, for sticking with us through a painful 2011 Cubs season.  You made the season more enjoyable for us.  </p>
