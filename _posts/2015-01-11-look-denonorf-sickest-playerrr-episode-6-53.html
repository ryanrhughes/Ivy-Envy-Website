You could say that Cubs Convention signals the beginning of the upcoming baseball season and the event is this upcoming weekend.  Andy and Corey will be going to Chicago for the convention and we talk about what we're expecting this weekend.  If you aren't able to attend the convention, follow us on Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a>.  If you don't use Twitter, the live stream of our Twitter feed will be displayed in the first post displayed on our website, IvyEnvy.com</p>
<p>Spring Training is also coming up and we've decided that we will be doing a meet-up at the Cubs @ Diamondbacks game on March 19<sup>th</sup>.  If you will be at Spring Training and would like to join us, you can purchase the general admission lawn seats from <a href="http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=ari" target="_blank">Diamondbacks.com</a>.</p>
<p>More concrete details on the TV broadcasts of Cubs games.  Kurt shares the latest info, which is exactly what we speculated would happen.  There's a lot of concern with Cubs fans in the midwest outside of Chicagoland.  If you are outside Chicago and worried that you won't have access to Cubs games on tv in 2015 and beyond, listen to this episode to hear how you can do your part in making these broadcasts available in your local market.<br />

<p>The Cubs added a veteran right-handed hitting platoonable outfielder in Chris Denorfia.  The real debate in this conversation is whether his nickname should be Deno or Norf.  Either way, you need to look at him.  He's the sickest playerrr.<br />

<p>Sporting News created a little buzz this week by predicting that the Cubs will win the World Series in 2015.  We comment on this and call it what it is.  </p>
<p>We have several questions from listeners, including conversations such as whether or not there's a nickname that rhymes with Lester that isn't "molester".  There's a question about Samardzija's performances later in the season.  We talk about the future of Welington Castillo and what the Cubs may get in return for their extra catcher.  We also compare Cardinals fans and Reds fans.  </p>
