<p>We talk about what Soler has done in the minors, why his call-up is different and what our expectations are, this year and beyond for Soler.  </p>
<p>The list of Cubs prospects that will be participating in the Arizona Fall League has been released and we briefly talk about these players.  </p>
<p>We answer a slew of listener questions, most of the Soler in nature.  We wrap the show up with a few Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
