<p>Episodes of The Daily Northside Recap will be available first thing, Monday through Friday mornings.  This podcast will recap the previous day's games in the Cubs organization.  You will hear the results and statistical highlights for the Chicago Cubs, Iowa Cubs, Tennessee Smokies, Myrtle Beach Pelicans and South Bend Cubs.  </p>
<p>Because the 2015 season has not started yet for the minor league teams, the Opening Day rosters will be discussed on the podcast.  </p>
