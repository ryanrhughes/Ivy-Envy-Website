excerpt: "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><strong>***This is Part I of my \"Cubs
  games in Phoenix\" trip.  I'll post Part II tomorrow and you won't want to miss
  tomorrow's photos***</strong></em></p>\r\nMy wife and I take our kids
  to Southern California every summer for 3 weeks to visit my wife's family.  It just
  so happened that this year, the Cubs would be out West at the same time.  In March,
  it seemed like a great opportunity to see the Cubs play in Phoenix and Los Angeles.
  \ Remember where we were as Cubs fans in March?  Publicly, we predicted the Cardinals
  to win the division, but deep down, we held out hope that Derrek, Aramis and the
  trio of Carlos could pull off something special and make 2010 a season we'd never
  forget.  Plus Tawny and I met in Tempe, Arizona.  It's where I proposed and we hadn't
  been back there in 6 years.\r\n\r\nHowever, in late June, it didn't seem quite as
  appealing to spend 3 days of my vacation with this Cubs team.  They were maddening
  and I had no interest in cheering for anyone besides Starlin Castro, Ted Lilly and
  Marlon Byrd.  However, I woke up early on Monday July 5th and left Orange County,
  California to drive across the desert to catch the first game of the Cubs vs. Dbacks
  series, early that afternoon.  Similarly to my <a href=\"http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2363\"
  target=\"_blank\">recap of the Wasting Away in Wrigleyville Pub Crawl</a>, I
  will mix in some tweets, photos and fill in the gaps.  My recap of the Dodgers game
  will probably come next week.  If you're not the reading type, check out episodes
  2.18 and 2.19 of the Ivy Envy Podcast for my recaps via audio.  We made this trip
  to Arizona with my sister-in-law, Tiffany and my brother-in-law, Jay.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  I'd like to say that I really enjoyed the interaction on Twitter with other Cubs
  fans.&nbsp; Thanks for following us on Twitter.\r\n<blockquote>Breakfast at McDonalds
  in Corona, CA on the way to the #Cubs game in Phoenix.     6:30 AM Jul 5th</blockquote>\r\nI
  eat McDonald's about once a year.  It's always on a road trip.  It did cross my
  mind that it might not be a good idea to eat McDonald's when you're about to trek
  5 or 6 hours across the desert.\r\n<blockquote>107 degrees in Blythe, CA. Insert
  Zambrano hot-head joke here. Should get to Chase Field right at game-time. #Cubs
  \    1:01 PM Jul 5th</blockquote>\r\nA big thank-you to Jay for driving.&nbsp;
  After the drive from IL to Southern California and knowing we had to turn around
  and go back home in a week, it was awesome to be able to fart around and send Ivy
  Envy tweets in the backseat.&nbsp; Also, You'll have to excuse my repeated comments
  on the heat.  I'm from the Midwest.  We like to talk about weather.\r\n<blockquote>Arrived
  at Chase Field.&nbsp;     1:01 PM Jul 5th</blockquote>\r\n<center><a href=\"http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Outside.jpg\"><img

  into Chase Field right at game-time.  The fact that we left a little later than
  we wanted and had two female bladders (one of which is pregnant...not her bladder,
  you know what I mean) made this accomplishment even more impressive.  There was
  a small problem brewing (not the McDonald's).  Tawny and I are vegetarians and ballparks
  are typically not the most vege-friendly venues.  Usually, I am left to eat nachos.

<blockquote><p>Arrived at Chase Field.&nbsp;     1:01 PM Jul 5th</blockquote><br />
<center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Outside.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3042" title="Chase Field - Outside" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Outside.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p>We walked into Chase Field right at game-time.  The fact that we left a little later than we wanted and had two female bladders (one of which is pregnant...not her bladder, you know what I mean) made this accomplishment even more impressive.  There was a small problem brewing (not the McDonald's).  Tawny and I are vegetarians and ballparks are typically not the most vege-friendly venues.  Usually, I am left to eat nachos.

<p>Even though TGI Friday's is about the most un-vege-friendly restaurant in the United States, at least we could get fries and a salad.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click "read more" to see this massive post and all the photos.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-3017"></a>So we got to our table just as Kosuke Fukudome was stepping up to lead off the game.  Here's our view from the table inside TGI Friday's:</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-TGI-Fridays.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3021" title="Chase Field, TGI Friday's" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-TGI-Fridays.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p>If you don't remember, (because the game was 2 1/2 weeks ago) Fukudome led off the game with a homerun.&nbsp; I believe it was center-field-ish.&nbsp; As you can see, most of the outfield is not in my line-of-sight, and I was in the middle of ordering my french fries, so I didn't see the exact path of the ball.</p>
<p>Also, I was able to capture a photo of the most majestic artist rendition of Randy Johnson's mullet that I have ever seen.  Am I crazy or can I see a Bob Brenly resemblance in Randy's face?</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Randy-Johnson.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3037" title="Chase Field - Randy Johnson" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Randy-Johnson.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="283" /></a></center></p>
<p>After our bellies were filled with french fries, we wandered around the concourse a little bit.&nbsp; We discovered that their organist is located in the upper level concourse in left field.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Organ.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3046" title="Chase Field - Organ" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Organ-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p>Seated next to the organist were what we figured had to be the oldest season-ticket holders.&nbsp; I'm guessing they have had season tickets for the entire existence of the Dbacks.&nbsp; This is what I want from my senior citizen years.&nbsp; Put a couple of score-cards in their hands and it's perfect.&nbsp; I do love the headphones.</p>

<blockquote><p>@CollegeofIdiots Tons of empty seats here. Is that typical or can these 2010 #Cubs not draw in PHX anymore?     Monday, July 05, 2010 3:27:44 PM</blockquote><br />
The guys from <a href="http://www.collegeofidiots.com" target="_blank">College of Idiots</a> are from the Phoenix area and they were at these games, as well.  You will notice, especially in the photos from Tuesday evening's game, how empty Chase Field was for these games.  Paid attendance for Monday's game - 26,250.  The place holds 49,000.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Empty-Seats.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3030" title="Chase Field - Empty Seats" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Empty-Seats.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<p>I asked Tawny's cousin's husband, Jeff who lives in Scottsdale about this.  He has been a Dbacks fan since they started and he attributed the lackluster numbers to a poor Dbacks season and the fact that the Cubs are frustrating for their fans doesn't help attendance much.  There are tons of Cubs fans in the Phoenix area, but it was clear they didn't show up for these games, either.  This makes me feel like more of a loser/sucker for driving 1800 miles to Southern California and then another 375 miles to Phoenix to see these guys play.</p>
<blockquote><p>Byrd bouncing into a RBI fielders choice was cheered by Dbacks fans in our section. They were real happy to get Theriot at 2nd, I guess.     Monday, July 05, 2010 2:39:04 PM</blockquote><br />
It was difficult to gauge the Dbacks fans around us.  I wouldn't say they were baseball dumb, but they definitely weren't baseball smart.  One thing that stood out to me was that they were surprisingly "rural".  I wouldn't expect to see much cammo print in a metro area with a population of 4.3 million.  I mean, Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the United States.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kissing cam just led to the engagement at of a female Cubs fan and male Dbacks fan.     Monday, July 05, 2010 2:43:33 PM</blockquote><br />
It's part of the Modern Stadium vs. Classic Stadium debate - The Kissing Cam.  It's cheesy as hell.  But really, there is nothing else going on between innings and it didn't really bother me that much.  It gave me a few chuckles.  I guess I don't mind this stuff that much at other stadiums. I just don't want it at Wrigley or Notre Dame Stadium, thanks.</p>
<blockquote><p>The amount of blasting music flashing lights for that DBacks triple gave me an apomplectic seizure.   Monday, July 05, 2010 4:49:37 PM</blockquote><br />
First off, if you haven't seen the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0178451/" target="_blank">Fishing with Ghandi</a>, you need to.&nbsp; But this is where I can't hang with modern stadiums.&nbsp; It was hotter than hell outside, so the roof is closed.&nbsp; The stadium is at half-capacity.&nbsp; Yet, when one of the Dbacks hit a triple, it was like I was in the Waco compound and the ATF was trying to drive me out.&nbsp; Flashing lights everywhere and POUNDING music.&nbsp; I think it would have been disguised better if there was more than 10,000-15,000 Dbacks fans in the crowd.&nbsp; But a smattering of applause being crushed by system noise is not a pleasant baseball experience in my book.</p>
<blockquote><p>By the way, $4 beers at Chase Field.     Monday, July 05, 2010 2:45:12 PM</blockquote><br />
Yes...$4 beer.  I think the $4 beer was supposed to be Coors Light or something but the vendor gave us 12 oz. of Blue Moon for that price.  We might have been his only customers of the day, so he decided to give us a deal.  I will reference these $4 beers next week when I write about my trip to Dodger Stadium and their $11 beers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roof is closed at Chase Field, but a bird just shit in my sister-in-law's frozen yogurt! #Cubs #Dbacks     Monday, July 05, 2010 3:39:35 PM</blockquote><br />
Now, it's no secret the Cubs won both the games we went to, and swept the series.  However, this moment may have been the highlight of the trip for me.  They sell soft-serve frozen yogurt at Chase Field.  And if you would have told me that a few days earlier, I would have used that in my case against modern stadiums.  But you know, it was a hot day and we were pretty laid back with an entire section to ourselves.  The Cubs were winning and even if they did blow the game, I've already detached my emotions from the Cubs this season.  Frozen yogurt?  That sounds pretty damn good.  So Tiffany is eating hers and sees something white fall into her cup.  She calmly asks if there is something white on her Cubs hat.  I'm thinking she leaned over and dipped her hat into the yogurt.  No, a pigeon defecated in her yogurt like Lauryn Hill defecates on your microphone.  As I said, the roof was closed and there were some birds flying around, but not a large enough number that you would expect to get shat on.  As previously mentioned, Tiffany is pregnant and I've seen how quickly a pregnant woman can throw up.  Kudos to her for keeping it together.</p>
<blockquote><p>The stats on the big scoreboard at Chase Field are fairly informative and interesting. Can't stand the replays and highlights, though.     Monday, July 05, 2010 3:55:30 PM</blockquote><br />
I will get into the scoreboard in Part II with photographs.  This is another aspect of modern stadiums in which I was surprised that I actually liked.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most runs scored by the Cubs in over 3 weeks, since the 12 run Angels game, I believe.  Monday, July 05, 2010 4:10:11 PM</blockquote><br />
Yes, it was the most runs scored by the Cubs in over two weeks.  If you take away that Angels game, it was the most runs they had scored since May 2nd, when they also played the Dbacks.  This is a team that put up a ridiculous amount of runs on a regular basis in 2007 and 2008.  But now they require the historically awful Dbacks pitching staff to be able to put up these numbers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dbacks defense is very quick.     Monday, July 05, 2010 6:12:04 PM</blockquote><br />
The Dbacks pitching staff might be awful, but their defense, particularly in the outfield was fun to watch.  These outfielders (at least in this series) covered a ton of ground.  Cole Gillespie's <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=9679575&amp;query=%26game_pk%3D265043" target="_blank">grab in left-field robbing Aramis Ramirez of extra bases </a>even earned him a spot in the top 10 plays of the day on SportsCenter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Waved our W flag. Feels good.  Monday, July 05, 2010 4:21:28 PM</blockquote><br />
<center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Corey-and-Tawny-W-Flag.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3051" title="Corey and Tawny W-Flag" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Corey-and-Tawny-W-Flag-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="280" /></a></center></p>
<p>This photo really annoys me because Tawny is standing a step higher and it makes me look even more like a leprechaun.&nbsp; I will swallow my pride and share the photo with you.&nbsp; I was surprised, but I only saw 2 or 3 other W flags.&nbsp; I think the W flags are kind of cheesy, but at the same time, I like them.&nbsp; It felt good to be on the road and bring a little bit of Wrigley to an opposing ballpark.</p>
<blockquote><p>Walking out of the ball park, well over 100 degrees, someone is blasting "Go Cubs Go". Let the party in Phoenix begin!     Monday, July 05, 2010 4:39:08 PM</blockquote><br />
<center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Cubs-fans.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3052" title="Chase Field - Cubs fans" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Chase-Field-Cubs-fans.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="281" /></a></center></p>
<blockquote><p>#Cubs fans partying outside Chase Field.  Monday, July 05, 2010 6:44:29 PM</blockquote><br />
More on that bar and the "Go Cubs Go" in Part II.  As it turns out, the Diamondbacks weren't real keen on a bar right next to Chase Field playing a Cubs song.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's...hot...in...Phoenix...in...July.     Monday, July 05, 2010 6:47:52 PM</blockquote><br />
They say it's a dry heat, and it is.  I would take 107 degrees of desert dry air over 93 degrees of humid Midwest air.  We walked quite a distance a few times while we were in Phoenix and I didn't have a soggy shirt or anything.  The sweat dries right off you.  However, I remembered that you have to carry water everywhere you go.  There was one time where I felt as though I could curl up in a ball and die from not having water.  Redheads aren't meant to be in the desert, I suppose.</p>
<p>So that wraps up Part I.  I hope to have Part II done for tomorrow.  The photos are MUCH better.  You might wonder why, and let me tease you to keep you interested in the next post.  I went to will-call on Monday before the game and picked up our tickets for Tuesdays game.  They were cheap nose-bleed upper deck seats.  We were invited to Jeff's house for dinner that night.  He and his wife were going to go to Tuesday's game with us.  When I handed them their tickets, we noticed that the dates for those tickets said Monday July 5th.  They had given me the wrong tickets.  There was some confusion (my fault) when I ordered the tickets in March and I wasn't sure I had the updated confirmation number.  So we weren't sure we had seats, which based on the attendance for Monday's game didn't seem like a big deal.  But it did add a bit of confusion and frustration.  All I will say is that things turned out much better.  Thanks for suffering through this ridiculously long post on an event that happened over two weeks ago.</p>
