  content: 'Discussion topic: Do you guys think the expanded playoffs cheapen the
    World Series? If the Cards and Tigers end up in the World Series, it will be a
    match-up of two teams tied for 11th in regular season records. The playoffs makes
    for "exciting" baseball, but I''m not sure it''s "quality" baseball. On top of
    that, it just doesn''t seem fair to call one of these teams the "World Champion,"
    when they lost 15 more games than the Yankees and Nationals.'

Our live broadcasts will continue throughout the off-season.  Like in previous years, we are moving our off-season podcast recordings to Tuesday nights at 8:30pm Central.  These episodes will be shorter (30-45 minutes) and we will be continuing the photo caption segment.  Kurt will be putting his Scary Stat of the Week on hiatus in the off-season.  We are replacing that segment with a yet-unnamed segment.  You can hear the first installment in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7818" target="_blank">Podcast Episode 4.37</a>.  We would appreciate any name suggestions you have for the segment.  </p>
<p>So starting this week, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">ivyenvy.com/live</a> on Tuesday nights at 8:30pm Central to watch our live video broadcasts.  </p>
