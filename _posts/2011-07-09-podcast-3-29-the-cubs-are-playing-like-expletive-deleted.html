<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey via Skype one last time.  Next week, we'll be back and recording in our normal manner.  In this episode, we talk about some of the stuff going on in the Cubs' minor league system.  We discuss Sean Marshall's role on this team and the idea of the Cubs moving him.  Darwin Barney draws some comparisons to Ryan Theriot and we talk about whether that's an accurate accusation.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
