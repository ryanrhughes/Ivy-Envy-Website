  content: "I had a blast at this event.  It was fun and it is highly recommended
    for anyone who enjoys family entertainment.  Everyone I encountered at the ballpark
    was super cool and the fireworks were even much more than I expected.  Lot of
    promise in the Cardinals' farm system has me worried, no lie.  River Bandits look
    very sharp.  \r\n\r\nI think that the reason that Morla left the pen early was
    that they throw so many warmups on the actual mound before the inning gets started,
    it would have been kind of pointless for him to throw two more balls out there.
    \  \r\n\r\nYeah, I kind of feel bad about some of the stuff we had said about
    Shruck via emails and texts, but it's not like it was his fault.  It's not a complete
    game, but it's still not his fault.  \r\n\r\nKeep visiting the website for more
    game watches and podcasts!\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>For very few reasons other than he happened to be warming up in the Peoria Chiefs bullpen about 10 feet from us at the exact time that the beer served in souvenir River Bandits cups began to take effect, Ronny Morla has become our favorite Minor Leaguer.<br />

<p>Morla came into last night's game at Modern Woodmen Park&nbsp; in the 8th inning. I was a little let down that he strolled out of the bullpen towards the dugout before the Chiefs were done batting, so we didn't have a chance to present him with cheers of support as he entered the game.&nbsp; He apparently could have used a little pick-me-up going into the game.&nbsp; Morla gave up 3 hits, a walk and a run in one inning of work. The Chiefs lost an ugly game to the Bandits 13-1.</p>
<p>I said that his proximity and timing in the bullpen was one of the few reasons he is our favorite Minor Leaguer.&nbsp; There is one other reason.&nbsp; Ronny and Matt Spencer came to the Cubs organization in the trade that sent Aaron Miles to Oakland.&nbsp; Aaron Miles for a bullpen guy in Peoria with an ERA around 4.5?&nbsp; I'll take it!&nbsp; It's nice to have you on board, Ronny.</p>
<p>I was also able to congratulate Nick Struck on his no-hitter.</p>

After speaking with Struck, I feel bad for calling BS on his rain-shortened no-hitter on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2645" target="_blank">the last podcast</a>.&nbsp; This kid seriously looks 17 years old.&nbsp; Good job, Nick.&nbsp; You can only throw as many innings as Mother Nature allows.</p>
