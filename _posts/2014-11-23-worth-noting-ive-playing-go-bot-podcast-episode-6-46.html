<p>On this, the 283<sup>rd</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we answer listener questions.  Other than bringing Henry Blanco back to the organization, the Cubs didn't give us much to discuss this week.  </p>
<p>There are still lots of "big picture" discussions to have though.  Is this team a contender in 2015 like the front office says it can be?  Would we rather see the Cubs trade Castro or prospects?  How important is it for the Cubs to get a top-of-the-rotation starter this offseason?  How great is Rizzo's contract for the Cubs?  Would the Cubs re-consider a bad-deal swap with the Braves - Edwin Jackson for BJ Upton?  Is posting photos of mice carcasses on Instagram in bad taste?  Why would someone ask 21 questions on a message board?  </p>
