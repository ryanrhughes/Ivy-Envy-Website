<p>Here we are at Episode #200 of the podcast.  We're all in the studio and broadcast live.  If this is the first episode of the podcast you've heard, this one is a little different.  We take calls from the listeners and hear their scary stats, internet muscle flexes and general comments on the Cubs.  </p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for helping us get to #200.  It's your interaction with us that has given us the drive to get to #200 and beyond.  </p>
<p>Here's the photo for this week's caption contest.<br />
