<p>We sit down before we load up the car to do an overview of the last week.  We also tell you about the events that we have coming up.  Thank you for following us during our Spring Training coverage.  We have had an absolute blast bringing it to you and hopefully this Spring Training coverage is something we can provide for you next year and beyond.  </p>
