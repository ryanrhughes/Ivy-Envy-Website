  content: "OK, \r\n\r\nFukudome I'm cool if we move as it would be way overdue.  \r\n\r\nCarlos
    Zambrano will end up getting traded to the Orioles for three used tampons and
    a set of candleholders.  (Non-polished)\r\n\r\nLet's not trade Ryan Dempster just
    yet.  He's a backbone of this franchise, even though we hardly have one.  Actually
    fuck it let's go ahead and see what we can get for him.  \r\n\r\nI don't really
    care about Blake Dewitt or Jeff Baker.  \r\n\r\nSean Marshall:  No.  Absolutely
    not.  I like Sean Marshall and I don't want to see him get moved.  I can see how
    we'd be able to get some trade value for him, but I don't want this to turn into
    a \"fire sale\" mentality where we just start unloading anybody with any trade
    value whatsoever.  \r\n\r\nWhoever started the rumors that the Yankees would be
    interested in Alfonso Soriano smokes waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much
    angel dust.  \r\n\r\nCarlos Pena I'm impartial about.  His BA isn't going to go
    up anytime soon and he's not a Gold Glove type of guy overall.\r\n\r\nI don't
    give a fuck about Grabow either.  He's going to lose no matter where he's at.
    \ \r\n\r\nJeff Samardzija:  I don't own any loyalty to Samardjiza and to be quite
    honest I'm tired of always double checking to see if I'm spelling his name right.
    \ \r\n\r\nKerry Wood is going to be in the booth at some point so he's staying
    put.  \r\n\r\nI don't want to see Reed Johnson get traded I think the \"value\"
    we'd get for him isn't really known to anybody else that doesn't follow the team
    he's on.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The trade rumors fly around Major League Baseball this time of year, and this season is no exception. &nbsp;For us Cubs fans, this is an odd trading period. &nbsp;The Cubs are definitely not "buyers." &nbsp;Although, as I said on the last podcast, with Jim Hendry making the decisions, who knows what he will do. We joked about him trading our farm system talent away. &nbsp;I seem to remember him refusing to admit the Cubs were out of it last year until well after the trading deadline. &nbsp;At least we aren't hearing many of those statements this year. &nbsp;Even the chef of this disastrous meal can't argue that it's consumable.</p>
<p>Here are a few players who are, could be, or should be on the trading block and where things are at with them:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Aramis Ramirez</strong></span><br />
Ramirez is in the final year of his contract and has a club option for 2012. Ramirez would be seemingly easy for the Cubs to move to a playoff contender. &nbsp;He's heated up and having a decent season, batting .302 with 24 doubles, 17 HR and a team-leading 58 RBI. I don't know what the 3rd base situations are for all of the teams in the hunt, but he'd be great coming off the bench in a clutch situation. He'll either come through or pop out in foul territory to an infielder.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ramirez can reject any trade the Cubs put together (because of his 10-5 status), and he's said that he will not leave the Cubs. &nbsp;Ramirez stated that it would be "too tough" to accept a trade and move his family for a few months. &nbsp;I find it difficult to understand why Ramirez would reject a trade when he could have the opportunity to leave this train-wreck and go to a decent team. &nbsp;I can't see the Cubs bringing him back next year and paying the $16 million option. &nbsp;Paul Kinzer, Ramirez's agent, has said that this situation may change in August when Ramirez's children return to school in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>In 2003, who would have thought that Ramirez could leave the Cubs and go back to Pittsburgh to be part of a playoff race in 2011?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Carlos Zambrano</strong></span><br />
Carlos Zambrano has said that he's willing to waive his no-trade clause, but it doesn't seem that the Cubs will be moving him. &nbsp;Zambrano is owed $19 million next year and his 6-5 record with a 4.78 ERA probably doesn't have GMs beating down the door. &nbsp;Plus, I don't know if you've heard, but some people think that Zambrano might be a hot-head who could effect clubhouse dynamics.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Ryan Dempster</strong></span><br />
Ryan Dempster might be more attractive to teams than Carlos Zambrano. &nbsp;While Dempster's 2011 numbers don't look incredible (7-6 4.68), it's worth noting that if you throw out the month of April, he is 6-3 with a 2.92 ERA. &nbsp;Dempster's contract also ends in 2012. &nbsp;He is owed $14 million next year, which is 26% less than Zambrano.</p>
<p>So while Dempster looks like he'd be valuable for a team that needs a strong starter, Jim Hendry has "no interest" in moving him. Dempster's contract is up next year, and a playoff race in 2012 looks very unlikely, so I would like to see Hendry entertain offers from other teams to see what kind of prospects he could get in a deal. &nbsp;But why test the waters and see what's out there when you can announce throughout the trading session that you have "no interest" in moving a guy?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Matt Garza</strong></span><br />
Garza's name was lumped in with Dempster's in the "no interest" statement. &nbsp;This makes sense to me, though. Garza is pitching well, despite his 4-7 record. &nbsp;His ERA is at 3.80 and the bullpen has done NOTHING to help Garza win games. &nbsp;Garza is 27 and has some good years ahead of him. &nbsp;He is under the Cubs' control for 2 more years.</p>
<p>The main reason I think Garza should not be shopped is because the Cubs gave up a lot of young talent to bring him over. &nbsp;The Cubs sent Chris Archer, Brandon Guyer, Robinson Chirinos, Hak-Ju Lee and Sam Fuld to the Rays in the trade. &nbsp;Three of these players were ranked in the top 10 Cubs Prospect list by Baseball America: Archer (#1), Lee (#4), and Guyer (#10). It would be difficult to stomach Hendry trading Garza away for lesser prospects, less than a year later.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Alfonso Soriano</strong></span><br />
Funny, huh? &nbsp;There were actually rumors that the Yankees were interested in Soriano. &nbsp;Of course, that's not going to happen. &nbsp;Soriano spoke with Gordon Wittenmeyer of the Chicago Sun-Times and wasn't even aware that he had a no-trade clause. &nbsp;He said that he would waive it to go to a contender.</p>
<p>What a laughable situation. &nbsp;He knows his contract and performance are so bad that the Cubs would never be able to move him. He didn't even know he had a no-trade clause?! &nbsp;Of course he'd waive it; he knows he's guaranteed money and doesn't care who pays it. If he can go make $19 million and play for a good team, why not? &nbsp;Hey Alfie, you know if you play for a good team, the fans, management, and ownership might actually want you to play with a little effort. &nbsp;Your free-pass is with the Cubs, so you might as well exercise that no-trade clause.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kosuke Fukudome</strong></span><br />
I think Fukudome is the most likely to be moved in the next few weeks. &nbsp;This is the final year of Kosuke's contract, so there's no reason to keep him. Fukudome would make a great defensive subsitute/left-handed pinch hitter for a team making a push for the post-season.</p>
<p>I like Fukudome, but it's clear that Hendry overpaid for him. &nbsp;While he has not been the most consistent player, he hustles, and he is probably the most fundamentally sound player the Cubs have had over the last 5 years.</p>
<p>If Fukudome is on this roster at the end of the season, I have no idea what Hendry is doing. &nbsp;If the Cubs are able to move Fukudome, I don't expect them to get much out of the deal. You get top talent in trades when you send off someone that will have a huge impact on a team. &nbsp;Fukudome isn't going to give any team that push they need to get in, or win in the playoffs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sean Marshall</strong></span><br />
Sean Marshall seems to be a logical player to trade. &nbsp;I like Marshall a lot and feel that the Cubs should have given Marshall the opportunity to step into a starter role, rather than Rodrigo Lopez or Doug Davis. &nbsp;He's been very effective in his late-innings role, so he's become a victim of his success. &nbsp;If traded to a playoff contender, he would probably fill a similar role.</p>
<p>However, it's been reported that the Cubs have "no interest" in trading Sean Marshall. &nbsp;Sorry buddy, you'll be coming in and pitching late innings for the 2nd worst team in baseball. &nbsp;Marshall signed a two-year deal in the off-season, so if the Cubs don't trade him, he'll be back next year. &nbsp;I would like to think that the Cubs have plans for Marshall to move into a starter spot, but I think we know that the Cubs don't seem to have plans for anything right now.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Carlos Pena</strong></span><br />
Carlos Pena could have a pretty big impact on a team. &nbsp;We were all skeptical of the Cubs (Hendry) signing Pena (.196 batting average last season) for $10 million, but we liked the idea it was a 1-year deal. &nbsp;Pena started off with an awful April but has turned things around. &nbsp;In April, he batted .159 and had 0 HR. &nbsp;Since then, is hitting .248 with 20 HR and 47 RBI.</p>
<p>As I said, Pena's deal is for one-year, so it would make sense to move him. &nbsp;However, if the Cubs are going to consider bringing back Pena for 2012, they may want to consider how he feels about going somewhere else to finish this season. &nbsp;The Cubs are fairly shallow at the 1st base position in their system, so if they aren't going to go after Pujols or Fielder, Pena might make sense for 2012.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kerry Wood</strong></span><br />
I would be surprised if the Cubs moved Kerry Wood. &nbsp;I think he came back to the Cubs to end his career, and if there's any truth to the rumor that he came back to eventually end up in the broadcast booth, I don't think he's going anywhere.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reed Johnson</strong></span><br />
Johnson is a fan favorite because of his hustle and willingness to put it all on the line. &nbsp;This makes him valuable to other teams, and like Fukudome, he'd make a good defensive substitution and pinch hitter for a playoff contender. &nbsp;He's batting .336, which is 50 points higher than his career average.</p>
<p>Johnson would have to be tempting to other teams, but again, he's not going to bring back much to the Cubs in a trade. &nbsp;I wouldn't mind seeing him shipped off to a team and come back to the Cubs for a third time next season for another one-year deal. &nbsp;While he's no superstar, I enjoy watching him play, and I appreciate a player who goes full-force.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Blake DeWitt/Jeff Baker</strong></span><br />
With Darwin Barney establishing himself as the every-day 2nd baseman, the Cubs could easily ship off Blake DeWitt or Jeff Baker. &nbsp;Both are doing decent off the bench, especially Baker. &nbsp;Baker is also a little more versatile in the field, as he can play 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and the outfield.</p>
<p>The thing to keep in mind is that DeWitt and Baker aren't going to be in high demand. &nbsp;There are guys like this all over the place. &nbsp;The Cubs aren't going to get much in return in a deal for these two players.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>John Grabow</strong></span><br />
Who cares? &nbsp;The Cubs won't be in the situation for Grabow to blow games because they can't score enough runs to give their starters the opportunities to win games. &nbsp;Plus, even if he was able to come out with the Cubs ahead and pitch a good inning, Marmol or Wood would blow the lead. &nbsp;Grabow's contract ends after this season, and I will be happy to see him in another uniform and some other bad reliever step into his role on the Cubs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Jeff Samardzija<br />
</strong> </span>I am a Samardzija fan, but I've come to terms with the fact that the experiment did not work. &nbsp;I'm ready for him to leave, but nobody is going to go after him. &nbsp;How hilarious would it be to see him go to some team and win a World Series ring this year? Go Irish!</p>
<p>___________________________________</p>
<p>Today, MLB Trade Rumors reported on their site that Jim Hendry was in Des Moines yesterday and informed the Des Moines Register that he plans to limit his moves to players who will not be returning next season. &nbsp;So according to that statement, the only players that Hendry is willing to move would are: Fukudome, Pena, Grabow, Wood, Johnson and Samardzija.</p>
<p>Teams are starting to position themselves, and if Hendry is on the hot-seat as much as everyone thinks, let's see if he reacts by trying to bring in something for the future or if he lays a giant turd.</p>
