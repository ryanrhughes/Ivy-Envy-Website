<p>The Cubs losing baseball games hurts.&nbsp; The Cubs losing to Dusty Baker really hurts.&nbsp; The Cubs bullpen blowing a lead late in the game to Dusty Baker...that makes me want to<a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/2010/04/waiw-pub-crawl-reminder-edition.html" target="_blank"> circle Wrigley Field drinking my pain away</a>.&nbsp; I can handle losses like the one the Cubs were dealt on Opening Day.&nbsp; These blown games are tougher to swallow.</p>
<p>There are no Cubs fans Esmailin (har har) after this game.&nbsp; Caridad became a true part of this 2010 bullpen by giving up two walks, an infield hit and a grand slam to allow the Reds to come from behind and take the series opener, 5-4.</p>
<p>There are many frustrating aspects to last night's game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing to Dusty Baker</li>
<li>Giving up 5 runs on only 5 hits.</li>
<li>Yet another blown save.&nbsp; That's 2 in 4 games.</li>
<li>Ramirez and Soriano going a combined 0-9.&nbsp; Ramirez seemed to be swinging for the fences with every at-bat.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, he flied out deep twice.</li>
<li>Ending the game with the bases loaded and a weak dribbler to the mound by Chad Tracy, after benefiting from two Reds errors, is yet another deflating way for the Cubs to wrap up a game.</li><br />
</ul><br />
There are a few positives to take away from this game:</p>
<ul>
<li> Silva pitched a great game.&nbsp; He pitched 6 innings and gave up one run off three hits.&nbsp; Given how Silva pitched, I am hoping that health/injury is not the reason he left the game after 6 innings.&nbsp; Silva benefited from a very impatient-at-the-plate Reds team and threw only 71 pitches.&nbsp; I was definitely reminded of the Cubs under Dusty Baker with the way these Reds were hacking early in the count.&nbsp; He's pitched well and I hope Silva is fine.&nbsp; After the game, it was reported that he was experiencing some soreness.</li>
<li>Derrek Lee had a very un-Derrek Lee-in-April like performance.&nbsp; Lee went 3-4 with an upper-deck shot in the 9th to bring the Cubs within a run.</li>
<li>The Cubs managed 11 hits against the Reds and forced Homer Bailey out after 5 innings with 106 pitches.&nbsp; I am a fan of patience at the plate.</li><br />
</ul><br />
While the rest of the Cubs blogosphere tells you not to panic, I&rsquo;m telling you that this bullpen sucks and could very well ruin your summer.&nbsp; Though I am, admittedly, of the panicky and pessimistic breed.&nbsp; At work, I am known as the doomsday Cubs fan.&nbsp; "Eeyore", they call me.&nbsp; Well, it's interesting that two Cubs were quoted saying the exact same things I have said in the last few days.&nbsp;These are from Carrie Muskat's <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100409&amp;content_id=9174752&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">post-game article</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's hard -- we should be 3-1 right now," Silva said. "I think we're playing good enough. This is hard, because later on, you're going to need these wins, especially in this division."</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>"I hope the games we lost now we don't need in September," Alfonso Soriano said.</blockquote><br />
After the game, Paul Sullivan, of the Chicago Tribune, tweeted that the Cubs are considering bringing Ted Lilly up after one start in Iowa and moving Gorzellany to the bullpen.&nbsp; I hope to see some movement from the organization if this bullpen stuff continues.</p>
<p>If you are in the Chicago-area, you need to get to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=301569064025&amp;ref=ts#!/event.php?eid=301569064025&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville Pub Crawl</a> today.&nbsp; You know it&rsquo;s going to be epic if I am driving 360 miles round-trip.&nbsp; Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/IvyEnvy">Ivy Envy on Twitter </a>for a little commentary (possibly drunken) and photos during the pub crawl.</p>
