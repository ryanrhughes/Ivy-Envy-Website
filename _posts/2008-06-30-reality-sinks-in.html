<p>The Cubs have successfully sucked the life out of me after this weekend.&nbsp; The only thing keeping me from a complete meltdown after being swept by the White Sox is that the Cubs swept them the weekend before.&nbsp; The White Sox hit the cover off the ball and our pitching staff <a id="more"></a><a id="more-111"></a>is performing closer to where I think their skill levels really are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that injuries will catch up with a ball-club.&nbsp; You can't lose your All-Star outfielder in Alfonso Soriano, the&nbsp;ace of the pitching staff in Carlos Zambrano, and a gritty guy that helped spark this team early in the year in Reed Johnson, and expect to continue the pace that the Cubs were on.&nbsp; What usually happens is that the club will run off adrenaline for a series or two, then the loss of those players will catch up with them and they will hit a skid.&nbsp; This skid is even more imminent when you are forced to bring up people like Eric Patterson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So hopefully, the Cubs can limp into the All-Star break.&nbsp; We have two series against the Giants, a four game series with the Cardinals next weekend and a series with the Reds.&nbsp; This stretch is probably a good thing.&nbsp; The Giants and Reds are both not great baseball teams and maybe the Cubs can create a little more distance between themselves and the Cardinals down in St. Louis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at me, being an optimist.&nbsp;</p>
