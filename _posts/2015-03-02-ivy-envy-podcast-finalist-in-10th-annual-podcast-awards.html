<p>[caption id="attachment_11005" align="aligncenter" width="690"]<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014PodcastAwards.png"><img data-id="11005"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2014PodcastAwards.png" alt="2014 Podcast Awards Finalists" width="690" height="285" class="size-full wp-image-11005" /></a>We're thrilled to share that The Ivy Envy Podcast has been named a finalist in the 10th Annual Podcast Awards.  This is the 2<sup>nd</sup> year in a row we have been named a finalist for this award.   </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Photo-Mar-02-7-00-07-AM.jpg"><img data-id="11008"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Photo-Mar-02-7-00-07-AM-300x297.jpg" alt="Photo Mar 02, 7 00 07 AM" width="300" height="297" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11008" /></a>We're so honored to be listed among some of the biggest names in sports podcasting, including Dan Patrick and Matthew Berry of ESPN.  We'd like to thank all of you that supported us during the nomination period to help put us in the finals.  </p>
<p>We thoroughly enjoy providing our listeners with consistent commentary on the Chicago Cubs, and we feel that this is recognition that would not be possible without our listeners.  It's more of a hat-tip to our community than it is the audio files we produce.  </p>
<p>I will be representing Andy, Kurt and all of our listeners at the 10th Annual Podcast Awards Ceremony in Las Vegas, Nevada in April.  The ceremony will be hosted by Dennis Miller.  </p>
<p>Podcast Awards Finals voting starts Tuesday, March 3<sup>rd</sup>.  You can vote once a day for podcasts in all categories at <a href="http://podcastawards.com" target="_blank">PodcastAwards.com</a>.</p>
