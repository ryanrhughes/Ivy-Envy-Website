<p>Andy and Corey record this episode in our off-season format, through Skype.  This leads to much tomfoolery.  </p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/10/AndyManchu.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/10/AndyManchu-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="AndyManchu" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-6297" /></a></center></p>
<p>We talk about the fact that the Cubs still don't have a General Manager and our feelings about the Cardinals in the World Series.  Corey apologizes to a listener, Michael, for missing his "Welcome Back Kotter" reference.  Nick from Virginia asks about which player would make a decent player/manager for the Cubs and that gives Andy the opportunity to speculate on Sean Marshall's television viewing habits.  </p>
<p>Again, our off-season episodes will come out on Tuesday evenings and be about 30 minutes in length.  </p>
