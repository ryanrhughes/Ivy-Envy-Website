  content: I only had 1 beer at Wrigley because of the bathrooms. The lines were literally
    overlapping. I would have had 2 or 3 more, but I spent almost $400 for my ticket,  rental
    car and parking. I wasn't waiting in those lines.

<p>The Cubs dropped the Opening Night game to the Cardinals. We talk about Jon Lester's performance and the national dialogue on his unwillingness/inability to throw to 1<sup>st</sup> base. The Cubs managed to get runners on base, but just couldn't knock anyone in. They finished the game 0-13 with runners in scoring position. We also can't avoid talking about bathroom-gate.</p>
<p>Tuesday's night's Cubs/Cardinals game was canceled due to weather.</p>
<p>Wednesday's game was more pleasurable for Cubs fans. Strong pitching performances by Jake Arrieta and Lance Lynn kept the offensive production down, but the Cubs managed to capitalize on Cardinals mistakes and win the game 2-0. The bullpen has looked very strong in the first two games already.</p>
<p>The Opening Day rosters are set for the minor league teams in the Cubs organization. We go through and highlight some of the most interesting names on each team.</p>
<p>The photo caption contest returns. Here is the photo and listen to the episode to hear the entries and the winner.<br />
