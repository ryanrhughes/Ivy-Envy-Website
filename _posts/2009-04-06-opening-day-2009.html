  content: "I try to do the same and it works for about the first 30 games. Then they
    get in to a battle for the division lead or even just shooting for the .500 mark
    and my heart devours my brain.\r\n\r\nWith a new owner coming in maybe we (fans)
    can establish some Yankee-esque expectations of winning if we keep the heat on.
    Keep spending Ricketts."

<p>So here it is, Cubs fans.&nbsp; The day that will take the sting out of the 2008 Playoffs for us.&nbsp; A day we've been waiting six months for.&nbsp; But really, what's six months?&nbsp; Regardless of your age, "waiting" is what being a Cubs fan is all about.&nbsp; I've been waiting since I started following the Cubs in 1986.&nbsp; I've waited through a lot, but I wouldn't trade back any of it.</p>
<p>These last two Division Championships have spoiled us.&nbsp; For the last few years, our roster has been stacked.&nbsp; And legitimately stacked, not like "Cubs fan stacked" where most baseball fans have never heard of this group of guys we are convinced will take us to the playoffs. We've become fans that expect and demand success on the field.&nbsp; That's a very un-Cubs-fan thing to do.&nbsp; I won't do it this year.</p>
<p>It's my goal to enjoy the Cubs for what they are.&nbsp; I'm not putting expectations on this season.&nbsp; If I wanted to follow a winning team, there are plenty of other teams I could have switched to during my 23 years of interest in baseball.&nbsp; I fully expect that the Cubs will do well this season, but I have to understand that painful years are down the road, for sure.&nbsp; Baseball is, for the most part, cyclical.&nbsp; There will be a time when the Cubs don't have 8 players in the All-Star Game.&nbsp; So I'm just preparing myself for those days.</p>
<p>So this is what my head is trying to tell my heart.&nbsp; It's the internal battle that all Cubs fans know all too well.&nbsp; Which will win out this season?&nbsp; Your head or your heart?&nbsp; I'm rooting for my head, but I'd put money on my heart.</p>
