This is the 250th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast. On this episode, Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about the last week in Chicago Cubs baseball. The Cubs seem to be clicking at times and there are some aspects of the team that are encouraging. We mainly talk about Anthony Rizzo, Starlin Castro and some of the pitching.</p>
<p>Jake Arrieta is back from his injury and Andy talks about his first outing in 2014 for the Cubs. There's a pitcher tearing it up in Iowa after struggling in Spring Training. Kurt talks about Wada and we speculate why he might be experiencing so much success at AAA.</p>
<p>There's obviously been a lot of criticism of Cubs ownership and the front office. We talk about Patrick Mooney's piece and try to step out of our front office supporters shoes and look at the things that frustrate some Cubs fans. It seems that these "big picture" topics come up every week.</p>
<p>We answer some listener submitted questions, including some great questions from Dawn about options and Rule 5 players.</p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week early in the episode, we read some Internet Muscle Flexes and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.</p>
<p>We also discussed some upcoming events on this episode:<br />
