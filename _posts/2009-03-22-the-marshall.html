<p>Yesterday, Sean Marshall pitched five strong innings in the Cubs' 13-2 victory over the White Sox.&nbsp; It is nice to beat the Sox any time, but like I've said before, I don't give much credence to preseason games.&nbsp; It was nice to see some of the strong performances, however.</p>
<p>-Our 5th man Marshall seems to be ready to go--yesterday he gave up five hits over five innings and struck out three.&nbsp; He is 3-0 in spring training with a 1.40 era in 19.1 innings pitched.</p>
<p>-Koyie Hill is having a good spring.&nbsp; He collected two hits yesterday and continues to make a case for jettisoning Bako into space.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">...is also finally making an impact.&nbsp; He has 9 hits in 23 AB, and yesterday he hit his first homer in spring training.&nbsp; I am pro-Bradley; he will be good for this team.&nbsp; Even though Milton Bradley made <em>Trouble</em>, <em>Conspiracy</em>, and <em>Where's the Beef?</em>, they also made <em>Perfection</em>, <em>Battle Masters</em>, and <em>KerPlunk</em> (that's a good noise in baseball, right?).</p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">-Jake Fox is playing well, but what do we do with him?</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-DeRosa is going to play 1st base for Team USA today.&nbsp; He did play 1st base once for the Cubs when Lee was injured.&nbsp; He is probably doing everyone's taxes as well.&nbsp; We want you back, Mark.</p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Only 15 days 'til opening day!&nbsp; Expect a new Ivy Envy podcast soon.</p></p>
