<p>Yesterday I settled in for nice long day of baseball.&nbsp; The World Baseball Classic was on, and the Cubs-Brewers matchup was actually being televised as well.&nbsp; It was going to be a good day, and not surprisingly, the WBC games ended up being the most exciting part of the day.</p>
<p>Cubs-related moments--</p>
<p>-Marmol pitched pretty well.&nbsp; He showed a little bit of wildness in his one-inning outing, but he settled in nicely, striking out three straight after hitting the first batter he faced.&nbsp; He looked like he had a very live arm; his fastball had good velocity and he had some good movement on his breaking pitches.&nbsp; He still has to have the closer spot locked down over Goggles McFirstnames.</p>
<p>-I saw a couple shots of DeRosa and Lilly hanging out in the dugout and got a little sentimental.&nbsp; Peavy struggled a little in his start, and I found myself wishing that <a href="http://tedlillyfanclub.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">TMFL</a> would've started instead.</p>
<p>-Soto played pretty well in PR's first game.&nbsp; Though he did strand some runners, he also drove in a run and drew a walk.&nbsp; It was strange to see him as DH and not behind the plate calling the game.</p>
<p>-Fukudome has walked four times in two games, and that's about all I have to report on him.&nbsp; I wish that guy would start hitting.</p>
<p>The good parts of the Cubs-Brewers game:</p>
<p>-It was a chance to see many of the Cubs young pitchers, and they looked pretty good overall; they didn't give up any runs after Zambrano left the game, and David Patton pitched especially well.</p>
<p>-That's about it.</p>
<p>The bad parts of the Cubs-Brewers game:</p>
<p>-The Cubs have now dropped 7 out of their last 8 spring training games after their strong start.</p>
<p>-Reed Johnson's <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=94" target="_blank">facial hair</a> is more robust than ever.&nbsp; It is a slight improvement over the way-too-manicured chin strip (emphasis on "slight").</p>
<p>-Soriano can still be pretty annoying to watch.&nbsp; He can also be pretty exciting to watch, but that side of him didn't show up too much yesterday.</p>
<p>-The lack of <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=151" target="_blank">offense</a>.</p>
<p>And I'm spent.</p>
