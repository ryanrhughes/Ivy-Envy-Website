We return from Spring Training and share what we saw during the six games in five games and at the backfields.  </p>
<p>We start things off by discussing the topic all Cubs fans are talking about right now, Kris Bryant.  We look at the comments others have made about the situation, from Scott Boras to Theo Epstein to the media to Bryant, himself.  There are a lot of angles to look at, but our opinions haven't changed and all signs point to the Cubs starting Kris Bryant 2015 in Iowa. </p>
<p>We spend most of this episode talking about things we saw at Spring Training.  Between the regular games, the B-game, the backfields and spending a game in the broadcast booth, producing the Cubs.com broadcast with Mick Gillispie and Len Kasper, we have a lot to talk about.  </p>
