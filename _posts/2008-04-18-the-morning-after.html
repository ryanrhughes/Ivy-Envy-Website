<p>*&nbsp; I'm a Cubs fan.&nbsp; I should know better than to publically display optimism.&nbsp; Ted Lilly is now 0-3 and has not had his ERA below 9.00 since his first game.&nbsp; I knew better than expect a repeat performance of last year (15-8, 3.83 ERA), but he's been just awful so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-21"></a></p>
<p>*&nbsp; If anyone can explain the Blanco bunting situation from yesterday's game, I'd really appreciate it.&nbsp; Two on and no outs with the pitcher coming up behind him.&nbsp; He shows bunt every pitch and ends up fouling out on a bunt.&nbsp; Pat and Ron suggested it was a missed sign.&nbsp; I can't believe a catcher would miss that sign.&nbsp; And if it was a missed sign, why wouldn't Mike Quade have straightened it out, especially after 4 or 5 pitches.&nbsp; That whole thing had me baffled.&nbsp; Of course, the inning ended with no runs.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Let's hope for no rain on the North Side today.&nbsp; Well, maybe a&nbsp;Rain Delay, so I&nbsp;am able to see some of the game after work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Ramirez and Pie could borrow Reed Johnson's bat.&nbsp; He was the bright spot of yesterdays game, without a doubt.&nbsp; I've been real pleased with that pick-up.&nbsp;</p>
