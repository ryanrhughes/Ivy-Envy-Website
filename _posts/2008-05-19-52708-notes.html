<p>*&nbsp; This homestand was just great.&nbsp; At the beginning of the homestand, the Cubs were 2 games behind the Cardinals.&nbsp; After going 8-2, the Cubbies are now 2 games up.&nbsp; The most remarkable aspect of this homestand was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-78"></a>&nbsp;Alfonso Soriano.&nbsp; In those 10 games, Soriano batted .525 with 7 HR and 16 RBI's.&nbsp; So it's no surprise that he was named the <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080519&amp;content_id=2730663&amp;vkey=pr_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb">NL Player of the Week</a>.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; So the Cubs leave the Friendly Confines and head South to play the Astros.&nbsp; The Astros are 12-4 in May.&nbsp; They typically don't play this well until their annual August/September surge.&nbsp; I never speak too optimistically about the Cubs, but I feel like the Cubs are going to go into Houston and expose these guys as pretenders.&nbsp; If the Cubs lose this series, I will never&nbsp;publicly speak optimistically about the Cubs again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Jim Edmonds will most likely start all three games in Houston, as the Cubs will face three lefties.&nbsp; This means they avoid Roy Oswalt.&nbsp; I am real interested in what Edmonds can do for the Cubs with some consistent playing time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080518&amp;content_id=2723867&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">Daryle Ward was placed on the DL </a>and Micah Hoffpauir was brought up from Triple A Iowa.&nbsp; Hoffpauir had a great Spring Training, but sat out the first month of the season with an injury.&nbsp; In 9 games, he is batting .324 with 3 HR and 12 RBI's.&nbsp; He made an appearance in yesterdays game and was struckout.&nbsp; Hoffpauir is no spring chicken.&nbsp; He's 28 years old and has been plagued with injuries.&nbsp; Perhaps the Cubs are showcasing him for a potential trade.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure there's much guaranteed playing time for a first baseman with a team that has Derek Lee.</p>
