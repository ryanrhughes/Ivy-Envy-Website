<p>As the Cubs minor league system is quickly becoming more stocked than it has been in many years, we can expect to see some *gasp* highlights from Iowa, Tennessee, Daytona, Peoria and Boise.  There have been a few videos surfacing the last few days and here's a couple of them.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo is waiting on the phone call from Chicago, and in the meantime absolutely crushing Pacific Coast League pitching.  In case you've been under a rock, Rizzo is hitting .370/.430/.753 with an OPS of 1.183.  His power numbers are insane.  Through 59 games, Rizzo has 22 HR and 57 RBIs.  </p>
<p>On Monday night against the Omaha Stormchasers (Royals), Rizzo went 3-4 with 2 HR, 2B and 4 RBIs.  Monday was the second consecutive 2 HR game.  Check out this video of Rizzo launching his second home run of the evening, in the 5th inning.</p>

<p>If you watched SportsCenter last night or this morning, you probably saw Peoria Chiefs 2nd baseman, Zeke DeVoss make the Top 10 Plays of the Day.  </p>

<p>The play ended a 5-run Kane County 2nd inning and as you heard Chiefs broadcaster Nathan Baliva say, saved two more runs from scoring.  If you were wondering, the pitcher in the video is Gerardo Concepcion, who had another rough outing, giving up 11 hits and 9 earned runs in 4 innings pitched.  On <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=7490" target="_blank">Saturday's episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast</a>, we spoke with Nathan Baliva and he gave us some insight with Concepcion that puts some of these bad outings into context.  </p>
<p>DeVoss was the 3rd round pick (98th overall) by the Cubs in the 2011 draft and has been with Peoria all of this season after spending the last part of the 2011 season in Boise. The 22-year old is batting .243 with the Chiefs this year.  </p>
<p>The Peoria Chiefs pitching has been stellar recently and despite the pitching breaking down and giving up 9 runs on 13 hits Monday night, the Chiefs won their 7th game in a row with Dustin Geiger's walk-off base-hit in the bottom of the 9th.  Geiger went 4-5 with a home run and 3 RBIs.  </p>
