  content: Just to clarify... WGN and ABC7 are able to negotiate with any local station
    within the Cubs market. It doesn't have to be an ABC or CW station. In previous
    seasons those games that WGN did on WCIU were also carried on a network of local
    stations. For example, they were on a MY TV station in South Bend. Independent
    or similar stations that don't have a rigid prime time schedule are much easier
    to work with because preempting old reruns, etc. for sports is not a problem.

    Also the use of out of market is a bit confusing because in MLB terms it means fans that live outside the Cubs MLB market.

    You are actually meaning those who live in the Cubs MLB market, but live to far away to pick up the over the broadcasts from Chicago.
    Out of market fans like me in Denver have no problem getting the games on MLB.TV or MLB extra innings.

We have discussed this several times over the last few months on The Ivy Envy Podcast. Listen to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/look-denonorf-sickest-playerrr-episode-6-53/" target="_blank">Episode 6.53 of the podcast</a> for the run-down.</p>
<p>Here's what we know:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 90 Cubs games in 2015 will be broadcast on Comcast Sports Net Chicago.</li>
<li>About 45 Cubs games will be broadcast on WGN-9 (NOT WGN America, but the local over-the-air WGN).</li>
<li>About 25 Cubs games will be broadcast on WLS-7 (ABC over-the-air).</li><br />
</ul><br />
Obviously, this topic came up at Cubs Convention this last weekend. Fans from around the Midwest traveled to Chicago and their ability to watch the Cubs was brought up around the convention frequently.</p>
<p>Here's what we heard from the Ricketts Family and Crane Kenney at Cubs Convention:<br />
<br><br />
<strong><u>The Cubs are looking to syndicate games outside the Chicago local market.</strong></u><br />
This is something we talked about on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/look-denonorf-sickest-playerrr-episode-6-53/" target="_blank">Episode 6.53 of our podcast</a>.  The WLS-7 games could be syndicated to your local ABC affiliate, most likely (though not necessarily) through their digital subchannels.  The WGN-9 games could be syndicated to your local CW affiliate (or a station/network owned by the same media partnership).</p>
<p>On Episode 6.53, I said that I have talked with one ABC affiliate in Illinois and outside the Chicago viewing area and they are "in negotiations" to carry Cubs tv broadcasts in 2015.  They did not specify if they were negotiating for just the WLS-7 games or all non CSN Chicago games.  </p>
<p>If you live outside of Chicago, I would suggest emailing or calling the station manager or programming director of your local affiliates.  It sounds like the Cubs may be initiating some of these discussions with affiliates, but it would not hurt to let your local affiliates know that you'd like to have access to these games in 2015.  </p>
<p>By the way, if you live in Indiana, DeRose has started a Facebook group called "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/536786746464570/?pnref=lhc" target="_blank">Let Indiana Watch the Chicago Cubs!</a>"  If you live in Indiana, join that group for updates on local affiliates.  </p>
<p><strong><u>If negotiations with affiliates are unsuccessful, the Cubs will ask MLB to lift the blackout in those affected markets.</strong></u><br />
If you live in the midwest, you're familiar with these blackouts restricting your ability to watch the Cubs on MLB.tv or MLB Extra Innings.  If you're hoping this is what happens, I wouldn't hold your breath.  I just can't see MLB changing this policy because of a team request.  That would open up a huge can of worms and probably demolish the blackout policy.  Which brings us to the next point.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Cubs expect in-market streaming pretty soon.</strong></u><br />
This idea of the blackout policy going away was mentioned in the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/recap-1st-ever-cubs-bloggers-forum-episode-6-47/" target="_blank">Bloggers Forum with Crane Kenney that I attended</a>.  At the Bloggers Forum, Kenney stated that he believes the blackout policy will be gone by the time the Cubs are ready to ink their next tv deal, which will be after the 2019 season.  </p>
<p>Media is changing and content delivery is changing.  At Cubs Convention, Tom Ricketts said that this issue is something that he and Crane Kenney bring to the table at MLB ownership meetings.  I would love to see the blackout policy done away with so that fans can watch the Cubs and other MLB teams how they want, where they want on the device they want.  </p>
<p>Since we are in the midwest but outside of Chicago, we will keep you updated on this situation through the blog and the podcast.  I'm optimistic that, for most of us, things are going to work out. </p>
