<p>After speculation, rumors and Wrigleyville Starbucks sightings, it's being reported that Theo Epstein is the next General Manager for the Chicago Cubs.  We at Ivy Envy haven't discussed the GM opening much.  I'll just speak for myself - I just don't follow that aspect of the game that much.  I'm not going to give myself a crash course in General Managers to try to come off as an expert.  I understand the difference in strategies as much as the average fan.  I understand that sabermetrics exist, and that without Jonah Hill, they wouldn't be as widely accepted in Major League Baseball.  </p>
<p>So you aren't going to get a major endorsement or critique of Theo Epstein from me.  If I had to choose a GM from the names that sportswriters and fans threw out there, I would have probably preferred Epstein.  </p>
<p>I was a little skeptical of Andrew Friedman.  You can't argue with the results in Tampa Bay, but Tampa is about as small-market of a team as you can get in terms of it's operations.  I don't think you can run the Cubs in the same way that you developed the Rays into perennial winners.  While there are some bright spots in the Cubs' minor league system, there aren't enough of those bright spots to develop in the short-term to put a championship-caliber team on the field.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are not the Rays - they have fans in the stands and they sell lots of Old Style. There is money available to a General Manager to spend on the team.  Friedman can identify young talent, but can he identify free-agents that are worthy of big money?  If he can't, I don't want to see the organization tied down to another General Manager who is in over his head.  I got enough of that this year with Hendry and Quade.  </p>
<p>I see Billy Beane as being very similar to Andrew Friedman.  I don't want the Cubs to be someone's first shot at the big show.  Yeah, he had an approach...an approach that gave him domination of the AL West for the first half of the last decade.  But since 2006, the Athletics have only finished .500 once (.500 in 2010).  I'm just not real comfortable with the idea of bringing in a guy who has that recent record and has never run a team with money to play with.  The A's finished 3 games ahead of the Cubs this season with about half of the payroll, but that doesn't mean anything to me.  </p>
<p>So the Cubs brought in a General Manager who just oversaw a historic September collapse.  The Red Sox held a 9-game lead in the AL Wild Card race on September 3rd and went 7-19 and handed the Wild Card spot over to Friedman's Rays.  Boston was the first team in MLB history to miss a playoff spot after leading by as many as 9 games heading into September.  That's right, the Cubs just hired the guy who has a worse blemish on his resume than the 1969 Cubs.  </p>
<p>However, since he took over as General Manager of the Red Sox, the team has been in the playoffs 6 out of the 9 years.  Two of those playoff appearances resulted in World Series Championships. Oh yeah, and in 2009, Sporting News named him the Executive of the Decade, and his Red Sox, the Team of the Decade.  </p>
<p>But the Red Sox wouldn't be willing to let Theo walk if there wasn't some question with him.  I mentioned the collapse this season.  Also, the Red Sox have not won a playoff game since 2008.  The Red Sox haven't won the division since 2007.  In fact, that was the only year in Epstein's tenure that the Red Sox were AL East Champions.  And while the Red Sox did not have a sub .500 record under his watch, the team hasn't had a sub .500 record since 1997.  So the cupboards were not bare when Epstein took over as GM.  </p>
<p>My point is this...the Cubs probably got a good (if not great) General Manager.  But they did not get Baseball Jesus.  This team is as bad today as it was a month ago.  There is a ton of work to do and Epstein has never faced a disaster of a team like this.  We can hope for moves...tough decisions...and hopefully right decisions.  But we will see some bad decisions.  We will see some things that frustrate us.  And we will probably not see the Cubs in the playoffs in the short-term.  So be glad we have a GM who doesn't wear Tommy Bahama shirts and have Dunkin' Donuts on speed-dial.  That's what really matters.  </p>
<p>Oh, and we have an owner who appears to have a vision and isn't afraid to spend money, although he might trip on his shoelaces trying to get there.  </p>
<p>If you thought Cubs Convention ticket sales rose today, what do you think will happen if Epstein hires Ryne Sandberg as the manager?  </p>
