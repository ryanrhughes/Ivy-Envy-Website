  content: I don't know, Andy.  I think the team could have a sub 4.00 ERA.   That
    is, if Silva is not in the rotation.

<p>In 2008, the Cubs had a regular season record of 97-64.&nbsp; The wins seemed to come in bunches, and at times, it seemed like the team was unstoppable.&nbsp; Since then, the wins have been less plentiful.&nbsp; The Cubs were 83-78 and 75-87 in 2009 and 2010 respectively.&nbsp; We're hoping that downward trend doesn't continue, and that the win total doesn't dip into the sixties.&nbsp; Sixty-some wins makes me flash back to Dusty's '06 squad, and I would rather drill into my molar than think about that club.</p>
<p>So what made the '08 team so successful and subsequent teams less so?&nbsp; Several statistical trends stand out upon examination of these squads.&nbsp; One of them is run production from the three and four hitters in the lineup.&nbsp; In 2008, Derrek Lee and Aramis Ramirez together drove in 201 runs.&nbsp; In 2009, they drove in 176 runs, and in 2010, they drove in 139.&nbsp; Now there were some injuries in there (notably Ramirez's shoulder issues in 2009), but it is still interesting to see how the decline in run production mirrors the downward trend in over those three seasons.&nbsp; As a team, the Cubs scored 855 runs in '08, 707 runs in '09, and 685 in '10.</p>
<p>Another statistic that is interesting to look at is team ERA.&nbsp; The '08 team had a 3.87 team ERA, and interestingly enough, the '09 team had a 3.84 team ERA.&nbsp; All of a sudden the weary memory of the 2009 season and the lack of run support comes flooding back.&nbsp; The team ERA of the 2010 squad was 4.24.</p>
<p>I realize as I'm writing this that it sounds like one of those brain-dead talking heads on television who make their keys to the game things like "score runs" and "pitch well."&nbsp; Where this becomes more interesting is when you consider whether this year's team is capable of numbers like the 2008 team.&nbsp; Can the tandem of Byrd and Ramirez drive in 200 runs?&nbsp; Will Fukudome, Baker, and Castro be able to get on base enough to give Byrd, Ramirez, and Pena the chances they need?&nbsp; I think the answer to this question is potentially "yes."&nbsp; Does this year's pitching staff have a sub-4.00-team-ERA season in them?&nbsp; I feel like the answer to this question is potentially "no."&nbsp; I'm a little concerned about the pitching, but we'll just have to wait and see what happens.</p>
