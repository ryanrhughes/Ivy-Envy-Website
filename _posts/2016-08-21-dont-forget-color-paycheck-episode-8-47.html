<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Thanks for downloading the 425th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  The Cubs lost their weekend series to the Rockies and we talk about this series.  The Cubs got a heck of a start from Mike Montgomery (and a great relief appearance from Cahill).  Jason Heyward got the weekend off and hopefully that helps him get back on track at the plate.  </p>
<p>The Cubs sent John Lackey and Hecton Rondon to the disabled list and brought up a couple of guys from Iowa.  This leads to a discussion on the lack of quality pitching in the farm system.  </p>
<p>Kurt shares a Scary Stat of the Week and we read some Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
