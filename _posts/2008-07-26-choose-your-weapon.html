  Ever since the All-Star break, it seems that we never know which bat the Cubs hitters will swing on a particular day.&nbsp; Too often it has been the ice bat, and quality starts are being wasted.

    I noticed Samardzija's musical tastes.
    My man-crush is developing quickly.

    1. Notre Dame
    2. Cubs
    3. Music

<p>Harden has 30 strikeouts in his three starts for the Cubs, and he still has yet to get a win.&nbsp; We need Soriano to heat up again, and hopefully the rest of the lineup will follow suit.&nbsp; At least there have been plenty of enjoyable defensive highlights in the past few games.&nbsp; Today Reed Johnson threw himself at another hit in the gap.</p>

<p>DeRosa also had a great diving catch on Thursday as well.</p>

<p>And let's not forget Fukudome's catch in the ivy.</p>

<p>Plays like these along with the great pitching have made the past few games great to watch; the Cubs just need to pick up the hot bats.&nbsp; Tomorrow we might get to see Samardzija pitch again--that guy likes some good music.</p>
