<p>As we enter the last month of the 2011 season, I think we can officially start talking about the future without looking like idiots ignoring the present. The event that kicks off the focus on the future is the expansion of the MLB rosters, which begins tomorrow. I've never understood the roster expansion, especially when looking what it can do to a minor league team which is fighting for, or headed to the playoffs.</p>
<p>Regardless of the effect it has on the minor league teams, the Cubs will be able to call up anyone on their 40-man roster. Also keep in mind that just because someone isn't on their current 40-man roster doesn't mean we won't see them. Take a look at the <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/roster_40man.jsp?c_id=chc" target="_blank">40-man roster</a> as it stands...it's fairly depressing.  I was hoping to get a look at <strong>Welington Castillo</strong>, one of the many catcher prospects in the system, in September.  Unfortunately, Castillo was placed on the DL with a hamstring injury.  </p>
<p>That's not to say there is nothing encouraging going on in the minor league system right now.</p>
<p>*  <strong>Javier Baez</strong>, the Cubs pick in the 1st round of this year's draft has moved up to Boise, following the end of the Rookie League season.  I would love to see Baez start in Peoria next year.  </p>
<p>*  Andy <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6177" target="_blank">posted about </a><strong>Rebel Ridling</strong> a few days ago.  He's on a tear and hitting the cover off the ball for the Tennessee Smokies.  It's nice to see him progressing as a player.  </p>
<p>*  The biggest news out of the minors this year is another 1st basemen in the system, <strong>Bryan LaHair</strong>, who just set the Iowa Cubs record for HRs in a season.  He currently has 38 HRs with a solid .333 batting average on the season.  LaHair will be 29 next season, so while he's no young prospect, if the Cubs go cheap and don't go after a free agent (or Carlos Pena) in the off-season, I suppose the battle for 1st base would be between Tyler Colvin and Bryan LaHair.  I'll let you try to figure out who I would prefer.  I'll give you a hint: In Spanish, his last name means "The Hair".  </p>
<p>*  If you're in the Phoenix area, the Cubs are sending some notable names to the Mesa Sky Sox in the Arizona Fall League.  <strong>Andrew Cashner</strong>, <strong>Brett Jackson</strong>, <strong>Trey McNutt</strong>, <strong>Chris Carpenter</strong>, <strong>DJ LeMahieu</strong> and <strong>Junior Lake</strong> will be suiting up this fall.  If Brett Jackson does not get called up to the Cubs in September, this could be his chance to showcase himself heading into a position competition in Spring Training.  While LeMahieu has played the majority of his games in the minor leagues at 2nd base, the Iowa Cubs have used LeMahieu at 3rd base more than anywhere else this year.  I would assume the Cubs are looking to see if DJ could be a stop-gap at 3rd base if the Cubs decide to go cheap and let Aramis Ramirez go.  LeMahieu doesn't have the power (3HR in 53 games) to be the 3rd baseman of the future, but if the Cubs are going to sacrifice a season next year to start putting things together, we might see a LeMahieu/LaHair combo for the corner infield spots.  I'm sure with that news, you're anxiously awaiting the release of the 2012 MLB schedule so you can plan your trips to Wrigley.  </p>
<p>Those are a few of the things going on.  At this point, there isn't a TON to get excited about with the Cubs, but I think it's going to be a real interesting time.  The Ricketts essentially have a blank slate.  What happens in the next six months will tell us a lot about what kind of owners the Ricketts will be.  There's a lot up in the air and I honestly think it'll be pretty interesting to see where everything lands.  </p>
