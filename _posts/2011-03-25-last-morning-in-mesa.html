<p>We are packing up our gear, loading it back in the Toyota Corolla and pointing that car east to head home - back to real life.  It's been our pleasure to report on Spring Training and to have you all along for the ride.  For both Kurt and myself, this was our first full Spring Training experience and it exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>While there were some "I can't believe that just happened" moments, the "regular" moments were just as interesting and memorable.  Over the next week or so, we will be sharing a few of the more exciting stories in written form on the site.  We have talked about them on the podcast, but we know there are some people that read the blog and don't listen to the podcast.  Kurt will be writing about the Marlon Byrd hit to Mike Fontenot that Fontenot threw into the stands and Kurt snagged.  Just yesterday, Byrd signed the ball for him.  I will be writing about our fluke run-in with Ryan Dempster and James Russell at Tempe Diablo Stadium.</p>
<p>If you have discovered our site in the last week, thanks for taking the time to track us down.  We typically don't put out podcast episodes every day.  The podcast usually has a round-table format with 3-5 Ivy Envy writers and we tend to record those on Saturdays.  There are blog posts here on the site throughout the week.  You can follow us on Twitter and our name on there is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a>.  The regular season starts next week and we have created a Live Game Chat on our site.  If you want to celebrate or commiserate during the Cubs games with fellow Cubs fans, just head over to the site and click on the "Game Chat" tab at the top of the page.</p>
<p>If you're in the Quad Cities, we are having an event at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline next Saturday, April 2nd.  It's the second game of the season and the Cubs are hosting the Pirates.  The game starts at noon, we'll be doing a live podcast recording and starting that at about 11:30.  It will be a tailgate-themed event with a bags tournament.  We'll have some stuff to give away, including some autographs, one of which will be giving away a Fergie Jenkins autograph.  We will also be giving away a Cubs jacket that retails for $120.  So come on down to Twenty next Saturday and spend the afternoon with some other QC Cubs fans.</p>
<p>Our bus trip to Wrigley is May 14th versus the Giants and we have some spots available.  E-mail me for more information - corey@ivyenvy.com</p>
<p>So thanks for allowing us to share our experiences over the last week with you.  Let's see what the boys in blue can do in 2011.  Go Cubs!</p>
