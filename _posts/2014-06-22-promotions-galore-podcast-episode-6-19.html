<p>On this week's episode, Andy joins Corey in studio to discuss all of the promotions.  Kyle Schwarber was promoted to Kane County after a handful of games in Short-Season Boise.  Arodys Vizcaino and Armando Rivero were also promoted in the last week.  </p>
<p>Jeff Samardzija recently rejected the most recent (and probably final) contract offer from the Cubs.  We talk a little about this, and the seemingly inevitable trade that will send Samardzija to another team.  </p>
<p>We read some listener questions and a few Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
