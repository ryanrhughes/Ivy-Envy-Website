<p>I couldn't believe the video of Marty Brennaman that Corey posted the other day.&nbsp; I understand that they were mad about the balls being chucked onto the field, but mention it and move on!&nbsp;<a id="more"></a><a id="more-27"></a></p>
<p>This Brennaman rant is a prime example of why I feel we're fortunate to have Len and Bob as our commentators.&nbsp; In one of the games against the Phillies, there was a close play at first base during which Soriano (I think it was Soriano) was called out.&nbsp; The replay showed that he was probably safe.&nbsp; Len and Bob noted that it was their opinion that he should have been called safe, but then they went on to talk about how their opinion is meaningless; the only opinion that matters is the opinion of&nbsp;the first base umpire.&nbsp; Other commentators who shall remain nameless would dwell on calls like that for several&nbsp;innings after the fact.&nbsp; Len and Bob do a good job of trying to remain objective about the game.&nbsp; I haven't really heard them be excessively negative about fans or players of the opposing team; in fact, they usually only have positive and constructive comments about opposing players.</p>
