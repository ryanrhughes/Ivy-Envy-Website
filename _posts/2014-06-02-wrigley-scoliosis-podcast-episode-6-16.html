Andy and Corey did a tour of Wrigley Field on Saturday and did this tour with renovations on their minds.  We answer a handful of listener questions, many of which involved Jason Hammel and other pieces the Cubs will most likely trade away. Corey reads a few Internet Muscle Flexes and Kurt gives two Scary Stats of the Week.  Congrats to Dawn for winning this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
