<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt gather (sans mustaches) to talk about this week's events in the world of the Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have acquired back-up catcher George Kottaras from the Kansas City Royals.  We talk about why Kottaras should be a good back-up for Welington Castillo.  We also talk about why the Cubs will not try to re-sign Dioner Navarro.  </p>
<p>We talk a little about the hot commodity (once he becomes a free-agent) from Japan, Masahiro Tanaka.  Who is he and why do the big spenders in baseball want him?  And are the Cubs really in the list of organization willing to spend the big money to get the right-handed pitcher?</p>
<p>Corey gives the Samardzija trade rumors update.  We answer listener questions, which include questions about the Ivy Envy bus trip to a Cubs game and a Doctor Who based question involving the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We read some Internet Muscle Flexes and pick this winner for the photo caption contest: </p>
