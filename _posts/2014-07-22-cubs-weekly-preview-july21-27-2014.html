<p><span style="color: #0e3384;font-size: 23px;font-family: Century Gothic"><strong>W</strong></span>hat happened last week: Swept by Arizona 0-3; 40-57, 5th place NL Central</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e3384;font-size: 23px;font-family: Century Gothic"><strong>W</strong></span>hat&rsquo;s up this week: July 23 off, July 22-24 vs. San Diego, July 25-27 vs. St. Louis</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e3384;font-size: 23px;font-family: Century Gothic"><strong>W</strong></span>ho&rsquo;s pitching: Tuesday (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=445590">Eric Stults</a>&nbsp;3-11, 4.98 ERA vs. <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=543294">Kyle Hendricks</a> 0-0, 6.00 ERA), Wednesday (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=453178">Ian Kennedy</a> 7-9, 3.62 ERA vs. <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=493159">Tsuyoshi Wada</a> 0-0, 0.00 ERA), Thursday (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=475115">Tyson Ross</a> 8-10, 2.70 ERA vs.&nbsp;<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=429719">Edwin Jackson</a>&nbsp;5-10, 5.61&nbsp;ERA), Friday (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=523260">Joe Kelly</a> 2-1, 2.84 ERA vs.&nbsp;<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=475243">Travis Wood</a>&nbsp;7-9,&nbsp;5.12 ERA), Saturday (Carlos Martinez 2-4, 4.43 ERA vs.&nbsp;<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=453562">Jake Arrieta</a>&nbsp;5-1, 1.94 ERA), Sunday (<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=425794">Adam Wainwright</a> 12-4, 1.83 ERA vs.&nbsp;<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=543294">Kyle Hendricks</a>&nbsp;0-0, 6.00 ERA)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0e3384;font-size: 23px;font-family: Century Gothic"><strong>W</strong></span>ho to watch for: San Diego has never had a player hit for the cycle, nor has it had any pitcher throw a no-hitter. Since being called up, Cubs rookie 2nd baseman <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=570489">Arismendy Alcantara</a> is hitting .290 and slugging .548 in seven games.</p>
