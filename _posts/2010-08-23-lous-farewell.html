    see him manage the Cubs.  I think it's cool that our bus trip participants got
    to see his last win.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

  content: "I agree with you. I enjoyed Lou being with us. I watched the game the
    day you guys went hoping I would see you all. \r\nThey were talking how he is
    the first mgr to lead the cubs to 3 consecutive playoffs in over 100 years. That
    really says something.\r\nLou is a sure fire Hall of Famer and its nice to hear
    someone appreciate his ten year, rather than cheering his departure."

So Lou is done, and his last day on the job was a ridiculous 16-5 loss to the Braves.&nbsp; Fortunately, the Ivy Envy bus-trippers went to the game the day before, which happened to be Piniella's last victory as a manager.&nbsp; The photo above was taken at the game, and that moment was Lou's last time arguing a call.</p>
<p>Personally, I enjoyed having Lou as the manager of the Cubs.&nbsp; I feel that he made good decisions most of the time, and I think that this abysmal season is more due to the personnel on the field.&nbsp; It is hard to forget 2008, in which Lou led the Cubs to a 97-64 record.&nbsp; I remember watching the Cubs in the last few weeks of that season, wondering if they would crack the 100-win mark.&nbsp; They didn't quite get there, but their record was still the best in the National League.&nbsp; Lou also compiled 1,835 wins during his managerial career.</p>
<p>If you missed the final post-game press conference, <a href="http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=5484545" target="_blank">check it out</a>.&nbsp; Lou gets very emotional, and he seems to hold the city of Chicago, the Cubs, and Cubs fans in high regard.&nbsp; Thank you, Lou--we appreciate your years as "the fine manager of the Chicago Cubs."</p>
