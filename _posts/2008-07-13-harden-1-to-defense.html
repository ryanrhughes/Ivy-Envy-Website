excerpt: 'One of the most exciting aspects of the Cubs-Giants emotional roller coaster
  yesterday was the performance of Rich Harden.&nbsp; He was a strikeout machine,
  fanning 10 batters in 5+ innings pitched.&nbsp; Before, when kids in Chicago heard
  the word "<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Harden_(move)"
  target="_blank">Harden</a>," they thought of a move their metapod pokemon could
  do that would add +1 to defense; however, now they will think of Rich Harden, the
  newest Cubs vehicle to victory.&nbsp; Harden''s range in velocity on his fastball
  as well as his excellent command threw the Giants'' hitters off.&nbsp; Add his great
  change-up to the mix, and we have a new prevailing wind originating at the plate
  and heading to center field.&nbsp; '

<p>One of the most exciting aspects of the Cubs-Giants emotional roller coaster yesterday was the performance of Rich Harden.&nbsp; He was a strikeout machine, fanning 10 batters in 5+ innings pitched.&nbsp; Before, when kids in Chicago heard the word "<a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Harden_(move)" target="_blank">Harden</a>," they thought of a move their metapod pokemon could do that would add +1 to defense; however, now they will think of Rich Harden, the newest Cubs vehicle to victory.&nbsp; Harden's range in velocity on his fastball as well as his excellent command threw the Giants' hitters off.&nbsp; Add his great change-up to the mix, and we have a new prevailing wind originating at the plate and heading to center field.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-125"></a> I am looking forward to his next start which is looking like it will happen in the series with Arizona after the All-Star break.</p>
<p>Speaking of the All-Star break, hopefully Marmol will emerge after some much needed R&amp;R recharged and ready to dominate again.&nbsp; Corey and I were speculating that perhaps Marmol has been overused in the first half; he currently has 52.1 IP--last year he ended up with 69.1 for the entire season.&nbsp; Hopefully another reliever will become a reliable lock-down pitcher for Lou to fall back on, so he doesn't have to always place that burden on Marmol.</p>
