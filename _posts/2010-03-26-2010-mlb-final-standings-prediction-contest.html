<p>The 2010 baseball season is just a few meaningless Spring Training games away.&nbsp; So it's time to throw your predictions out there.&nbsp; All you have to do is predict the final standings for each division and e-mail them to us: podcast@ivyenvy.com or you can just leave a comment on here with your standings.&nbsp; Feel free to throw in the playoff matchups, Cy Young winners, Rookies of the Year, or anything else.</p>
<p>We aren't sure of the prize that will be awarded to the winner, yet.&nbsp; At worst, it will be an Ivy Envy t-shirt.&nbsp; At best, it will be something better than an Ivy Envy t-shirt.</p>
