  content: Cuban was at a game two or three weeks ago.  Matt Veto sat near him in
    the bleachers at the end of last season.  This courtship has been going on a while.  I'd
    be pretty surprised if it happened.  It's my understanding that the sale of an
    MLB must be approved by a certain percentage of existing MLB team owners and I
    really doubt these guys want Cuban joining their ranks.

  content: Yeah.. baseball is extremely incestuous.. they pretty much only approve
    previous baseball guys.. so the likelyhood of Cuban getting it is slim, however..
    if he did, you know he'll field a good team every year.  He came out and said
    that if he got the team, he'd only sit in the bleachers though, and I've got respect
    for that..

<p>Great game by Dempster yesterday. He was so difficult to watch as a reliever last year, so this year he has been such a pleasant surprise as a starter.</p>
<p>Edmonds was okay yesterday. The at bat that he had with the bases loaded was <a id="more"></a><a id="more-75"></a>terrible, however. He took some of the most awkward swings I've seen in a long time, but I suppose that swings like that could be a combination of being rusty and trying too hard to produce some runs.</p>
<p>Also, buried in a recent MLB.com story about the sale of the Cubs is this piece of information:</p>
<p>"The Cubs and Wrigley Field packaged together could sell for $1 billion, based on recent sales of professional teams. Major League Baseball has approved prospective buyers, which include a partnership headed by John Canning Jr., chairman of Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban."</p>
<p>Mark Cuban?!? I can see it now: "Well folks we've got another fan on the field...er wait... that's new Cubs owner Mark Cuban, and he's punched the umpire in the face!"</p>
