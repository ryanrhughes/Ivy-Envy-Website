<p>The Cubs' 2011 draft was a strong one, and fans are looking forward to names like Baez, Vogelbach, DeVoss and Zych begin to work their way up through the minor league system.  The member of that draft class that has made the biggest impact in the first month of the 2012 season was not selected by the Cubs until the 19th round.  He was the 579th pick overall.  That would be current Peoria Chief 1B/DH, Paul Hoilman.</p>
<p>On April 14th, Hoilman had a .136 batting average.  On Thursday night, Hoilman got a hit in his 23rd straight game.  He has raised his batting average to .308.    </p>
<p>Hoilman isn't squeaking through this hitting streak, though.  Eight of those games have been multi-hit games.  15 of his 30 hits have been extra-base hits.  He's hit three home runs in the streak, including two grand-slams.    Since April 14th, he has 22 RBIs.  </p>
<p>Wednesday night, Hoilman set the Peoria Chiefs record for the longest hit streak with 22 games.  The Midwest League record is 35, which was set by Frank Toups in 1977.  </p>
<p>Hoilman was well-known for his bat in college.  He attended East Tennessee State and broke the Atlantic Sun Conference career record in home runs.  He was with Boise last year and set the franchise record with 17 home runs in 71 games and named to the Northwest League Post-Season All-Star team.  </p>
<p>While expectations wouldn't be high for someone drafted in the 19th round and 579th, Hoilman has been a pleasant surprise and extremely valuable for a Peoria team that has had problems generating runs.  </p>
