  content: I won't get in to the argument of who's piss tastes better. Trying to figure
    out which shitty beer is the best is like discussing the merits of city water.
    I know you've all heard a New Yorker claim theirs is the best and every time you
    want to punch them in the face.

<p>It was reported this morning over at <a href="http://www.thewrigleyblog.com/2011/07/old-style-out-as-official-beer-of.html" target="_blank">The Wrigley Blog</a> that Old Style will no longer be the official beer of Wrigley Field and the Chicago Cubs. They also stated that the rumors are that Old Style will be replaced with....Coors Light.  </p>
<p>I'm not up on the politics and everything of beer and beer manufacturers, but I knew that the new owner of Old Style, billionaire C. Dean Metropoulos, was ready to cut ties with the Cubs when he took over.  The Cubs have had this relationship with Old Style for 61 years.  Metropoulos owns not just Old Style, but Pabst Brewing Company, which Old Style is a part of, along with Schlitz and Pabst Blue Ribbon.  </p>
<p>These brands had life breathed back into them through the art and hipster subcultures via guerilla marketing, and Metropoulos has quite a different vision for them.  I read <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-04/business/ct-biz-0605-pabst-divorce-20110604_1_pabst-brands-beer-brands-pabst-brewing" target="_blank">an interesting article</a> about this new ownership and the direction they plan to take the brands. I swear I read this article about six months or a year ago, but the date says it was in June of this year.  If you're into beer or against "the man", this article is worth reading.  </p>
<p>It seems to me like a real bad move for Old Style, but us baseball fans are clearly not the demographic to which they are trying to appeal.  They have no use for those of us that sit down in the garage or out in the yard, turn on WGN Radio and crack open an Old Style.  They are turning their backs on generations of fans.  They are also turning their back on the hipsters that brought life back to the brands that are part of Pabst.  </p>
<p>If all of this goes down, I won't drink another Old Style.  If they don't want me, I don't want them - and that bothers me because Old Style is my cheap-beer of choice.  When I go to California every summer, I pack two cases of Old Style into the back of the mini-van.  I will have to find another cheap-beer replacement.  I'll need to find some tasteless, watered down, refreshing beer that is convenient when it's 100 degrees outside, or when the bank account doesn't allow for anything that Kurt and other beer snobs would consider being worth drinking.  </p>
<p>So I'm open to your suggestions.  If Old Style turns their backs on us, what do we go to?  Sorry, I can't get behind Coors Light.  I know they're all owned by huge companies and have lost all character, but I want something that is identifiably Midwest.  </p>
