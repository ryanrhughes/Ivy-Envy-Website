<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt fire up the mics a few days early so we can enjoy the Super Bowl.  Different recording night, same marginal analysis of the Chicago Cubs. </p>
<p>But first, here's what we're drinking:<br />
Kurt - New Belgium Mighty Arrow - (4 on Untapped)<br />
Andy - Half Court India Pale Ale (3 on Untapped)<br />
Corey - Breckenridge Oatmeal Stout, Point 2012 Black Ale, Millstream Brewing Company - Schild Brau Amber</p>
<p>We continue to avoid Cubs talk by giving our Super Bowl predictions.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are still held up with their Wrigley renovations by the rooftops and we spend some time talking about that.  Admittedly, we are not the experts on this topic.  Because of our distance from Wrigley and the fact that outsiders can't make sense of Chicago politics...and our lack of knowledge on legal issues, we engage in a very surface discussion on this topic.  If this is a topic that interests you, <a href="http://bleachernation.com" target="_blank">Bleacher Nation</a> is doing a good job of keeping up with the day-to-day developments and <a href="http://wrigleyvillenation.com" target="_blank">Wrigleyville Nation Podcast</a> is a group of guys that live in Wrigleyville and are season ticket holders.  </p>
<p>The Jeff Samardzija trade rumors involved the Blue Jays this week and we look at the status of his 2014 contract.  If you are interested in learning more about the arbitration process, I reference this <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/fangraphs-audio-eno-sarris-on-the-curiosities-of-arbitration/" target="_blank">Fangraphs Podcast episode</a>. </p>
<p>The Cubs added two pitchers on Friday, signing Jason Hammel, who will fit into the starting rotation.  The Cubs also signed avid fisherman James McDonald.<br />

<p>Spring Training is right around the corner, so we talk a little about the non-roster invitees and some of the minor league players we are looking forward to tracking in Spring Training this year.  Corey talked about being interested in how Matt Szczur does this spring.  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-06-bonus-interview-episodematt-szczur/" target="_blank">Here is a short interview we did with Matt Szczur a few years ago.</a>  Andy talks a little about the 3rd base situation and what we may see play out at "the hot corner" in Spring Training.  </p>
<p>We read some Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's caption contest. </p>
