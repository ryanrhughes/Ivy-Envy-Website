<p>It's been no secret that since the Cubs pulled a virtual no-show at the Winter Meetings in Indianapolis, Cubs fans have been a little anxious about the lack of off-season activity.&nbsp; But, once again, the Cubs show us that we have no reason to question or doubt them.&nbsp; So, while the Phillies ink Roy Halladay and the Red Sox get John Lackey, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091214&amp;content_id=7810854&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">the Cubs make a move to show who is truly willing to put a winning product on the field.</a></p>
