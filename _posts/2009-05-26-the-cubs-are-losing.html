<p>Well, I think I picked a good weekend to get out of town and miss Cubs games.&nbsp; I was up in Wisconsin eating cheese and drinking Spotted Cow.&nbsp; Maybe I'll just become a Brewers fan.&nbsp; Hell, I can get free tickets to Brewers games with the purchase of a Snickers bar at the Piggly Wiggly or a pizza from Pizza Hut.</p></p>

<p>Make your case, Cubs.</p></p>
