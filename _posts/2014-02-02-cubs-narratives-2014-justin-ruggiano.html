<p>Cubs fans are used to pulling for the underdog; we have a track record of pulling for the hardworking-yet-perhaps-low-on-talent player. &nbsp;This aspect of Cubs fandom is amplified during the rebuilding process. &nbsp;To keep ourselves entertained while watching a hapless team play out the lengthy string that is the MLB season can be a challenge. &nbsp;We have to find a narrative to follow, so I've decided that one of my narratives this season will be Justin Ruggiano. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with zeroing in on a player to root for is that the Cubs have been all business when it comes time to sever ties. &nbsp;If a player on a short-term, low dollar contract is playing well, they haven't hesitated to exchange the hot hand for prospects if it makes sense. &nbsp;They also don't hesitate to pull the plug on a struggling player who is not shaping up to be a part of the long-term plan. &nbsp;Getting attached to a Cubs player in the last four or five years is like getting attached to a George R. R. Martin character: there's a chance he might not last very long, so don't get too involved.</p>
<p>Justin Ruggiano was acquired from the Marlins in exchange for Brian Bogusevic. &nbsp;I'm not necessarily suggesting that Ruggiano isn't talented. &nbsp;Though he did have a poor season last year, the 2012 season was a career year for him (he hit .313 with 90 hits/13 HR/36 RBI in 288 AB). &nbsp;That good season is the exception in his limited big-league career, so that makes him a good story line to follow. &nbsp;Fans are going to want Ruggiano to succeed, not only because the Cubs need players like him to do well, but also because we long for down-on-their-luck players to "figure it out." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ruggiano has played all of the outfield positions, so it sounds like he will be platooning in both right and center field, according to Carrie Muskat. &nbsp;The Cubs have Nate Schierholtz, Ryan Sweeney, and Junior Lake in the outfield this year, so Ruggiano most likely will be starting in place of Schierholtz or Sweeney when the Cubs are facing a lefty. &nbsp;He will also probably be a regular pinch hitter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, if you need evidence as to what kind of a guy Justin Ruggiano is, check out <a href="http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-09-03/sports/sfl-marlins-justin-ruggiano-hits-girl-blog-20130903_1_wrigley-fan-wrigley-field-miami-marlins">this link</a>.</p>
<p>Which narratives will you be following this season?</p>
