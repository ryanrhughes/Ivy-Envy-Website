  style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Yesterday,
  my wife and I got to go to see the final game of the Cubs-Twins series, and it was
  the first time we have taken a bus trip to a game.&nbsp; The Cubs are now 3-0 in
  games I have attended.&nbsp; I realize the fact that I have only been to three games
  makes me sound like a bad fan, but in my defense, we do live three hours away from
  Chicago.&nbsp; Overall, I would recommend a bus trip since it removes the annoyance
  of driving and finding a parking space.&nbsp; It also allows you to watch your favorite
  cinematic masterworks such as <em>The Gameplan</em> and <em>Kicking and Screaming</em>
  (of course I am making fun of the Will Ferrell movie, not <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113537/\"
  target=\"_blank\">the superior Noah Baumbach movie with the same title</a>).&nbsp;
  However, the first movie of the trip was <em>Rookie of the Year</em>, and I
  thoroughly enjoyed it.&nbsp; The Cubs could use a <a href=\"http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/2009/06/cubs-media-monday-rookie-of-year-update.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">Henry Rowengartner</a> in their bullpen now.</p>\r\n<p
  style=\"text-align: left;\"></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I thoroughly
  enjoyed the game as well.&nbsp; I was aching for the Cubs to take this game and
  avoid the sweep.&nbsp; I knew having Lilly on the mound would help; it would just
  be a matter of stringing together some hits.&nbsp; And they did that in the bottom
  of the ninth.&nbsp; Lee's gutsy baserunning ended up winning the game for the Cubs,
  and time slowed down for me when Theriot hit his game-winning single.&nbsp; I can
  see the moment vividly in my head even now--our vantage point was perfect.&nbsp;
  The ball sliced off of Theriot's bat, and I thought Punto was going to be able to
  stretch far enough to get a glove on it.&nbsp; It seemed like slow motion as the
  ball breezed by the outstretched web of Punto's glove.&nbsp; As the ball found its
  way to the outfield, time was back on track, and we were all yelling and exchanging
  high-fives.&nbsp; It reminded me of the passage in <em>Of Mice and Men</em>
  that reads<em>, \"</em>As happens sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and
  remained for much more than a moment.&nbsp; And sound stopped and movement stopped
  for much, much more than a moment.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lilly
  had a predictably good performance on the mound, and Soto and Theriot also had much-needed
  good games.&nbsp; Even though Fukudome's stats for the game look bad, he did come
  very close to hitting two homers.&nbsp; I was pumped that I got to see Ted pitch.&nbsp;
  He has become my favorite Cubs player.&nbsp; Before the game, he ran along the warning
  track, greeting the fans, and they cheered him wildly.&nbsp; It was a great day!</p>\r\n<p

  vantage point for the game.&nbsp; The only downside to these seats was that there
  was no way to see a fly ball at the apex of its flight due to the overhang of the
  upper deck.\r\n\r\n"

<p>This is a closeup of my wife's Cubs barrette which I think is pretty cool.</p>

<p>We arrived just in time for the Twins' batting practice.</p>

<p>The grounds crew was working hard to get the field ready.</p>

<p><a href="http://tedlillyfanclub.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Tedtensity</a>!&nbsp; Replete with classic Ted arm-dangle.</p>

<p>This park is the best, but it is kind of held together by duct tape and wishes.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Soto" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y289/elwin_ransom/CubsTrip6-14045.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="337" /></p>
<p>He had himself a game!&nbsp; Two doubles in a 3-4 effort!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Lilly exits" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y289/elwin_ransom/CubsTrip6-14055.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="336" /></p>
<p>Lilly exits the game in the eighth inning.</p>

<p>Man, I hate to take Ted out, but the cloning machine is still sci-fi (TLFC is still working on it).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Marmol" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y289/elwin_ransom/CubsTrip6-14061.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="335" /></p>
<p>Marmol's release.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Scoreboard" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y289/elwin_ransom/CubsTrip6-14066.jpg" alt="" width="445" height="332" /></p>
<p>The nearest scoreboard seemed to be calling for extras...</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Bases Loaded" src="http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y289/elwin_ransom/CubsTrip6-14069.jpg" alt="" width="443" height="330" /></p>
<p>...but the Cubs loaded the bases and made it happen.</p>

<p>Cubs win!</p>

<p>Bradley is first to high-five the coaches.</p>

<p>Beyond the Ivy kept track of Lilly and Marmol's day.</p>
