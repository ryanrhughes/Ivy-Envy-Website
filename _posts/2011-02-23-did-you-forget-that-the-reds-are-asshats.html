<p>Last August, I wrote that <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3148" target="_blank">the Reds are the most un-likable team in the National League Central</a>.   A winning season brought a whole lot of cockiness to the Reds.  Under Dusty Baker, the Reds have become outspoken and bordering on "loose cannon-ish" about the other teams in the NL Central.  Allow me to refresh your memory and give you some quotes from my previous post.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&rsquo;t like the Cubs.  And I&rsquo;m not going to pat anybody with a Cubs uniform on the back.</p>
<p>- Joey Votto, in reference to Marlon Byrd's efforts in the 2010 All-Star Game.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>As long as it&rsquo;s not as bad as it was in Chicago, I&rsquo;ll be all right. The media killed me in Chicago for the first three weeks until I hit my first home run.</p>
<p>- Jim Edmonds, on if fans in Cincinnati would warm up to him.</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;d play against these guys with one leg. We have to beat these guys. I hate the Cardinals. All they do is bitch and moan about everything, all of them. &hellip; I really hate the Cardinals. Compared to the Cardinals, I love the Chicago Cubs. Let me make this clear: I hate the Cardinals.</p>
<p>- Brandon Phillips.  These comments led to a clearing of the benches the next day as Phillips tried to give Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina a friendly tap on the shin guards as he came to the plate.</blockquote><br />
We are just a few days into Spring Training and already, the Reds are flapping their gums about the Cubs and Cardinals.  Dusty Baker started things off by claiming that <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/3967960-419/dusty-baker-claims-someone-always-left-a-crap-in-cubs-dugout.html" target="_blank">someone defecated in the dugout </a>where Dusty always stood.  I have no idea where to start with this.  There are idiots out there.  How an idiot got into the dugout to leave a turd, I don't know.  Knowing human nature and the mentality of some sports fans, I don't find this claim to be that unbelievable.</p>
<p>What doesn't make sense to me is why Dusty would bring this up now.&nbsp; Why bring it up at all?&nbsp; Did he really feel the need to finally get it off his chest?&nbsp; Did Dusty really get his feelings hurt that bad by some fecal matter?&nbsp; Or is Dusty trying to fan the flames of trash-talk and inter-division hatred?&nbsp; I don't know Dusty and I don't know what makes him do what he does.</p>
<p>But something happened today that made me think this is Dusty trying to fire up the team this Spring to find that chip anywhere they can to put on their shoulders.&nbsp; The biggest news in baseball today was the update that Adam Wainwright is most likely going to need Tommy John surgery.&nbsp; This is a major blow to the Cardinals' efforts to de-throne the Reds as NL Central Champions.</p>
<p>Now, I'm a Cubs fan that grew up in Cardinals country.&nbsp; I don't like the Cardinals...at all.&nbsp; I do have respect for the organization, but I want to see them fail.&nbsp; I don't want to see a guy like Adam Wainwright lose a whole season to a serious injury.&nbsp; I'd rather see him go 1-22 on the season with a 8.65 ERA.&nbsp; Injuries are awful and I don't want to see any opponent suffer a serious injury.</p>
<p>I work with a lot of Cardinals fans and while I gave it to them for a few seconds, the discussion quickly turned to how unfortunate it is for Wainwright.&nbsp; This is a sentiment that I witnessed in watching the Cubs Twitterverse reaction to the news.&nbsp; But this wasn't everyone's reaction.</p>
<p>Hal McCoy of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dayton Daily News</span> was in the clubhouse when the news of Wainwright's injury broke and reported the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jonny Gomes walked into the Cincinnati Reds spring training clubhouse early Wednesday morning singing at the top of his warbly voice. The melody was not recognizable, but the words were plaintive: &ldquo;Wainwright&rsquo;s gone, Wainwright&rsquo;s gone, Wainwright&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he sang joyously.</blockquote><br />
Dusty Baker used the opportunity to jump back in the spotlight and get another dig in on Cubs fans and Chicago media.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Who are they going to blame for that one?"</blockquote><br />
Dusty was obviously firing back (3 years later) about the opinion held by many Cubs fans that he wore out his pitchers.</p>
<p>I'm sure all of this is good for the Reds' clubhouse.  You don't want to perceive yourselves as the defending division champions with a bulls-eye on their backs.  They are the young and fiery guys that can't get any respect.  It undoubtedly fires up their fans and helps ticket sales.  It's easier to talk big when you can back it up on the field.</p>
<p>I am not against some tension in baseball.  I'm a guy that doesn't like to see a guy get a hit and then chat it up with the other team's first baseman.  Compared to what Gomes said, I can almost hang with Brandon Phillips' comments.  We are not even a full week into Spring Training and the tensions are already building.  I wonder if the Reds were still in the Grapefruit League with the Cardinals if we might not see some hostility between the two teams.  I wouldn't expect much of a backlash from Cubs players or management against Dusty Baker.  The majority of the 2011 Cubs didn't play for Dusty and Quade seems way too even-tempered to even acknowledge any bad blood between the Cubs and the Reds.</p>
<p>If you were paying attention, a few weeks ago, this fine Reds blog <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo's Goggles </a>owned our site for a weekend.&nbsp; I dislike the Reds and every Reds fan I've ever seen a television shot of at Great American Ballpark looks like a gigantic mouth-breather.&nbsp; However, Brian over at Chris Sabo's Goggles is a good guy.  I can't wait to discuss these things with him in our NL Central Division Preview episode on the podcast.</p>
