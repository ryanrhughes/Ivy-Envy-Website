<p>Today, the Chicago Cubs wrapped up their regular season in Milwaukee against the Brewers.&nbsp; Earlier in the season, I expected this series to be epic, but the Cubs have had the division wrapped up for over a year.&nbsp; This series was still important, especially for the Brewers.&nbsp; Though the Mets have not lost yet, they trail in the 9th and it looks like the Brewers are headed to the post-season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would have been satisfying for the Cubs to keep the Brewers out of the playoffs.&nbsp; This also means that the Cubs will face the Dodgers&nbsp;in the NLDS.&nbsp; I would have preferred that the Cubs played the Mets, though I would imagine one particular IvyEnvy writer is pleased that the Cubs will be in the Los Angeles area at least once in this post-season.</p>
<p>Since I am an Eeyore Cubs fan, potentially facing the Brewers in the playoffs concerns me.&nbsp; It's not that I think <a id="more"></a><a id="more-241"></a>they match up against the Cubs&nbsp;or have played the Cubs particularly well.&nbsp; It's that it would only be fitting that the Cubs would lose in the playoffs to a team from their own division that they finished ahead of by 7.5 games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was fitting that the Cubs would end their regular season with a double play off the bat of Derek Lee.&nbsp; Also, I really hope Howry is not on the post-season roster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I will attempt to put my fretting and negative thoughts aside.&nbsp; The Cubs are in the playoffs for the second straight year.&nbsp; This team is better than it was last year.&nbsp; Let's have some fun with this.</p>
