<p>The AAA All-Star Game will be on ESPN2 tonight and I'll surely be watching.&nbsp; Matt Murton earned a spot on the PCL All-Star team.&nbsp; Chris Robinson, the catcher for the Iowa Cubs will be representing the team.&nbsp; Another name worth noting is Eric Patterson, who will be playing in the game for the Oakland AAA affiliate.</p>
