<p>Spring Training 2011 is underway for the Cubs in Mesa, Arizona and I assume you're as ready as I am for information about what's going on with the team.&nbsp; We at Ivy Envy will be providing you a week's worth of Spring Training coverage, March 19-25.&nbsp; We have been mentioning this on the podcast.&nbsp; Kurt and I will be packing up and driving the 1565 miles straight through.&nbsp; That will be 24 hours and 13 minutes.&nbsp; We'll be hitting every Cubs game while we are out there and tweeting throughout the games, posting photos on the site and we'll also be doing daily podcast episodes.&nbsp; We have a few extra things lined up, and you'll see what they are when they happen.&nbsp; There's nothing worse than talking something up and then it not happening.&nbsp; We can't wait to get out there and share our Spring Training experiences.</p>
<p>But our coverage is a long 4 weeks away.&nbsp; If you want coverage of Spring Training in the meantime, the only place to go is <a href="http://journal.boysofspring.com/" target="_blank">www.BoysOfSpring.com</a>.&nbsp; Boys of Spring is run by Tim Sheridan.&nbsp; Tim is the PA Announer at Hohokam Stadium and his access provides some great news and photos.&nbsp; Check out his blog and follow him on Twitter&nbsp; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BoysOfSpring" target="_blank">@BoysOfSpring</a> if you are as ansy about spring ball as I am.</p>
