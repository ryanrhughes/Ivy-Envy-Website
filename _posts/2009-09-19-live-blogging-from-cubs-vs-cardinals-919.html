<p>This live-blogging will be done today by Brian, who you may have heard lately on the podcast.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s at the Cubs vs. Cardinals game in St. Louis and was interested in doing this.</p>
<p>****We had technical difficulties and we are picking this up late***</p>
<p><strong>3:36:27 PM</strong>: it looked like scales helped the home run over the wall<br />
<strong>3:53:35 PM</strong>: cubs need to score some runs dempster is pitching a good game</p>
<p><strong>4:13:22 PM</strong>: double plays are killing the cubs</p>
<p><strong>4:25:51 PM</strong>: cubs trying to rally in the 9th</p>
<p><strong>4:45:53 PM</strong>: cubs lost.&nbsp; they are basically officially out of the playoffs wait till next year folks... go cubbies</p>
<p>***Technology somewhat failed us on this one.&nbsp; Sorry guys.&nbsp; Brian, thanks for trying to let us in on what was going on***</p>
