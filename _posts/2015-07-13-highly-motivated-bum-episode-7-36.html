  content: Just a thought -- in your conversation about what are the characteristics
    of a bum, all I could think about was Jonathan Paplebon. All he seems to do is
    rip everyone and everything that does not go his way. I sure hope we do not attempt
    to acquire him. I cannot imagine him being good for the clubhouse culture.
