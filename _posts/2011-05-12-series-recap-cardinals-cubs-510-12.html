<p>As Cubs fans, we are used to frustrating games.  In <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5229" target="_blank">the last podcast</a>, we talked about how the Reds series was frustrating because all three games were close and the Cubs had lots of guys on base and were just unable to drive them in.  This game was one of the most frustrating games I've seen in a long time.  It didn't take me long to get discouraged about this game.  Geovany Soto injured his groin and was replaced by Koyie Hill.  I'm not sure there's anyone in the entire Cubs system that I have less use for than Koyie Hill.</p>
<p>The game was riddled with terrible fundamentals and sloppy play.  They missed the cut-off guys, dropped baseballs and Soriano took bad angles and flopped around in the grass.  The most frustrating play for me was when Fukudome caught Theriot's line-drive and nailed Punto at the plate by at least 5 feet, only to have Koyie Hill drop the ball.  After the game, Hill said, "He couldn't make a better throw. I'm sick to my stomach about it. I take a lot of pride in defending. It's one of those things -- I kicked it."  I sure hope Koyie Hill takes pride in his defending, but if he took pride in his offense, he's one sorry individual.</p>
<p>There was plenty of frustration and disgust to go around on the offensive side of things, too.  The Cubs outhit the Cardinals 13-11 and stranded 12 base-runners.  By the way, every Cubs hit was a single.  Zambrano started the game and pitched well enough to keep the Cubs in the game.  The Cubs tied up the game in the bottom of the 7th and then Kerry Wood came one strike from getting out of the 8th, but gave up a two run single to put the Cardinals up for good.</p>

<p>We've introduced a new segment on the podcast called "Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week".  There have been a lot of scary stats, most involving the club's batting average with runners in scoring position...and anything related to Carlos Pena.  Well, this game was quite a relief in those two areas.  The Cubs had 18 baserunners in the game.  They only left 5 of those guys on base and went 7-13 with RISP.  The problem really hasn't been getting guys on base, this year.  This game was an example of what the Cubs could be doing with timely and consistent hitting.  Fukudome, Castro, Byrd, Ramirez, Pena, Soriano and Hill all had a multi-hit game.</p>
<p>Matt Garza pitched a good game, especially considering the effects that a rain delay can have on a pitcher.  Garza went 5 innings and gave up 1 run on 3 hits.  He walked 3 and struck out 7.  Garza is pitching pretty well and looks very good at times.  I still don't think we've seen him in his groove yet.</p>

WP - Garcia (5-0)<br />
LP - Coleman (1-3)</p>
<p>On <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5229" target="_blank">the last podcast episode</a>, Benjamin sent us a topic via <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a> and asked if we thought Casey Coleman is any good.  I have a feeling our answers might have been a little more negative if we recorded after this game.  Coleman got roughed up pretty good by the Cardinals in this outing.  He pitched 4 1/3 innings and gave up 6 runs on 9 hits.  Coleman also gave Cardinals batters four free-passes.  Coleman struggled finding the strike zone, throwing half of his pitches for balls.  If you watched Casey Coleman pitch today, you can't help but think he's a triple-A pitcher at this point in his career.  It's not his fault he was called upon to fill in for Wells/Cashner.  Coleman pitched well for the Cubs at the end of last season and at times, he's looked good this year, but I hope that Coleman is given the opportunity to develop as a pitcher in Iowa and maybe we can see him in a year or two, as a more complete pitcher.</p>
<p>After Wednesday's short reprieve from the habit of leaving guys on base, the Cubs went back to their old ways on Thursday's game.  Cubs batters left 8 on base and went 1-9 with runners in scoring position.  Simple math tells you that improved numbers in those categories wouldn't have been enough to save this game.  The game-time temperature was 84 degrees and the wind was blowing straight out.  These are the conditions for which we have been waiting for the Cubs to hit for some power.  It didn't happen today.</p>
<p>The best thing about this game is that Grabow pitched over an inning, so maybe we won't have to see him pitch on Saturday night, when our bus trip goes up to the Cubs/Giants game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RISP RISP RISP</strong><br />
Even with the great team performance with runners in scoring position on Wednesdays game, the numbers from the series are evident that there is a real deficiency in clutch hitting with this team.  The Cubs had 39 hits in the 3-game series, but stranded 25 runners</p>
<p><strong>Sports Illustrated Curse Over?</strong><br />
Starlin Castro has maybe put a halt to his little slump.  I suppose you can declare a slump over when you go 4-4 with a triple and 3 RBIs in a game.  In the series, Castro went 7-12 and raised his average to .322, after it had dropped to .300 heading into the series.</p>
<p><strong>Pena floating comfortably above the Mendoza Line</strong><br />
Speaking of raising a batting average, Carlos Pena has raised his batting average almost 65 points in the last 10 days.  I would be pretty content if this is the Carlos Pena we see for the rest of the year.  He's cut down his strikeouts.  In fact, Pena only struck out once in this series with the Cardinals.  He's seeing the ball well and making good contact.  Pena has been the source of quite a few of our "scary stats".  Here's a stat that's scary-good, considering it's a Pena number.  In the month of May, Pena is batting .344.  We're almost halfway through the month.  I hope he keeps this up.</p>
<p><strong>Is Byrd in the right spot?</strong><br />
There's been a lot of discussion in the Cubs blogosphere and Twitterverse about Marlon Byrd batting 3rd in the order.  I'm not real comfortable with Castro in that spot yet, so I don't see a problem with it.  I'm not sure if everyone has noticed, but this is not the perfect line-up and the pieces don't fit together all the time.  Byrd has quietly put together a nice 13-game hitting streak.  He's not hitting for much power (1HR) or driving in many runs (8 RBI), but he's hitting .306 and if can keep that up, he'll get his chance to impact the score of the games a bit more.  There was also some discussion in internet-land about Byrd being a hot commodity around the trading deadline because the outfield options are weak this year.  I'm not sure I'm ready for Tyler Colvin to step in and get more playing time in right-field, which would mean moving Fukudome (also trade-bait?) to center.  The Cubs main outfield prospect in the minor leagues is Brett Jackson and I'm not keen on the idea of pulling guys up before they are ready.  At this point, I'd rather see Byrd stay with the Cubs.</p>
<p><strong>Minimizing Pujols' Damage</strong><br />
For once, it was nice for the Cubs to play the Cardinals and not see Pujols go  ballistic at the plate.  Pujols hit the ball pretty well, going 6-13, but he only drove in 2 runs and scored once in the series.  Given what I've seen him do against the Cubs, especially at Wrigley, I would call that a victory in not allowing Pujols to take over the series.</p>
<p><strong>Division Foes</strong><br />
In the back-to-back series with the Reds and Cardinals, the Cubs have had a lot of missed opportunities and you can't give games away to the leaders of your division.  They end this little stretch against division opponents 2-4 and with some consistent play, the Cubs could have been 4-2 or even 5-1.  You're not going to be able to hang around in the race for the division title by giving away games.</p>
