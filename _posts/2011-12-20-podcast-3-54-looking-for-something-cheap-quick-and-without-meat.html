<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey through Skype and talk about the last week, which was probably the slowest of the off-season thus far.  The Ricketts family buys the McDonald's property across from Wrigley and we talk about the impact that will have on the neighborhood and fans, from our perspectives as visitors to Chicago, and not residents.</p>
<p>Trade talk is typical this time of year and we look at some of the players that have been mentioned in these rumors. Matt Garza, Anthony Rizzo and Paul Maholm are the main names that were rumored this week.  We discuss the idea of a Garza for Rizzo trade and the effect that would have on the pitching staff and the infield.  </p>
<p>If you'd like to check out the baseball card podcast episode we reference in this episode, here it is - <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1642" target="_blank">Podcast #26</a>.  </p>
