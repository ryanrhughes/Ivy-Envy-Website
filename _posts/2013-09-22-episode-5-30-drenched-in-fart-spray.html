<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt look at the drama with the Cubs pitching staff.  Edwin Jackson, Jeff Samardzija and Kevin Gregg each take issue with management and their decisions.  The Cubs decide to give Javier Baez the fall off and the front office will be evaluating Dale Sveum to decide if he will return to manage the Cubs in 2014.  We also have a very odd photo caption with an even more odd winning entry.  </p>
