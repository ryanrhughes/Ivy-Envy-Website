<p>If you went to Twenty Sports Grille in Moline tonight for our monthly game-watch, I am very sorry that we weren't there.&nbsp; I announced via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> that the game-watch is being moved to Tuesday night.&nbsp; When I scheduled this event, I didn't notice that tonight's game was a WCIU game.&nbsp; If you live in Chicago and wonder what that has to do with anything, we in the Quad Cities aren't able to watch the games televised on WCIU (yes, even with MLB Extra Innings).&nbsp; So we'll do this thing tomorrow night.</p>
<p>If you haven't made it to one of our game-watches, come on down.&nbsp; We are a harmless bunch and we'd love to hear your take on the Cubs.</p>
<p>Also, tomorrow morning I will be posting Part 2 of our podcast episode "Viva Los Doyers".&nbsp; This is a great interview with Gus Hernandez, a Dodgers season-ticket holder.</p>
