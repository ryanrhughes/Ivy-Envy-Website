<p><a href="/uploads/2014/04/prior.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/04/prior-256x300.jpg" alt="prior" width="256" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9672" /></a>In a game inundated with acronyms, TNSTAAPP is among the most peculiar. For starters, there most certainly is such a thing as a pitching prospect; I&rsquo;ve even written about a few <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/theo-thievery-breaking-matt-garza-trade/" target="_blank">here</a>. The meaning of TNSTAAPP is less a literal translation and much more an admission that the success of a pitcher is hard to predict- even for the savviest of scouts.</p>
<p>Pitching prospects are tough to forecast for more reasons than I can possibly document but chief among them:</p>
<p>a) Pitchers get hurt. They get hurt a lot. Throwing a baseball is an unnatural act so repeating that activity thousands of times, year after year, isn&rsquo;t exactly a recipe for longevity.</p>
<p>b) Success at the low levels is not a harbinger of success at major league level. As you'll see below, even success at the major league level doesn&rsquo;t always foretell future success in the bigs.</p>
<p>c) As with position prospects, you&rsquo;re dealing with 17-20 year olds who haven&rsquo;t fully matured physically or mentally. &nbsp;Inconsistency is par for the course.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The best way I know how to put the TNSTAAPP theory to the test is to apply it to our beloved Cubs.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Prior</strong>: The definition of a can&rsquo;t-miss pitching prospect, Prior had all the goods. He had stuff and polish, intangibles to boot. Why then, at 33, is Prior a member of the Padres front office and 8 years removed from an MLB mound? Because elbow and shoulder injuries are part of TNSTAAPP.</p>
<p><strong>Hayden Simpson</strong>: A first round pick in 2010, Simpson was a victim of pre-mature criticism* mixed with lofty expectations. When a brutal case on mono cost him 20+ pounds off of his body and upwards of 10 miles per hour off of his fastball, the righty never fully recovered and was eventually released by the Cubs in 2013. Simpson never made it beyond High-A Daytona, only seeing &lsquo;Double-A&rsquo; in his TNSTAAPP nightmares.</p>
<p>*At no fault of his own. Simpson was considered by many a &lsquo;reach&rsquo; when drafted as early as he was. Seeing the likes of Aaron Sanchez, Taijuan Walker and Noah Syndergaard taken after him still pains me.</p>
<p><strong>Dontrelle Willis</strong>: The D-Train is a cruel case of TNSTAAPP in that it looked as though he had beaten the odds, albeit with a different team. Willis was an 8<sup>th</sup> round pick of the Cubs but was wearing a Marlins jersey when he took home the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year Award. He was named the best left-handed pitcher in baseball in 2005, finishing 2<sup>nd</sup> in that year&rsquo;s Cy Young race. By 2007, he was posting a 5.17 ERA and it would only get worse from there. Willis proves that even when you think a pitching prospect has made it, long-term consistency at the position is an extremely rare feat.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Samardzija</strong>: Shark is definitely a case of TNSTAAPP, but in a style completely incongruous with our previous examples. Jeff was more football prospect than baseball before the Cubs paid him big money to try his hand every fifth day instead of every Sunday. Samardzija struggled to the point where he was written off as a failure even in a bullpen roll yet has emerged as Opening Day Starter material, tallying the 4<sup>th</sup> highest strikeout total (214) in the National League.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve paid proper tribute to the work of the TNSTAAPP gods, it&rsquo;s worth taking a look at how the Cubs front office is trying to overcome the problem. Quantity is definitely part of the equation for all organizations but what stands out to me about the Cubs arsenal of arms is a seemingly intentional emphasis on balanced variety in an effort to combat the inevitable variance.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the next crop of contenders to combat the TNSTAAPP conundrum for the Cubbies, categorized.</p>
<p><strong>International Wild Cards</strong>:&nbsp;Jen-Ho Tseng,&nbsp;Juan Paniagua,&nbsp;Ivan Pineyro,&nbsp;Greyfer Eregua</p>
<p><strong>High Probability Guys</strong>:&nbsp;Kyle Hendricks,&nbsp;Eric Jokisch,&nbsp;Neil Ramirez, Pierce Johnson</p>
<p><strong>College Arms</strong>:&nbsp;Rob Zastryzny,&nbsp;Tyler Skulina,&nbsp;Trey Masek</p>
<p><strong>Impact Relievers</strong>:&nbsp;Arodys Vizcaino, Zac Rosscup, Armando Rivero</p>
<p><strong>Huge Upside, Starter or Reliever</strong>:&nbsp;CJ Edwards, Corey Black</p>
<p><strong>Lottery Tickets</strong>:&nbsp;Duane Underwood,&nbsp;Paul Blackburn,&nbsp;Trevor Clifton,&nbsp;Dillon Maples</p>
<p>Overlap and confirmation bias caveats apply here as I was the one who chose these categories and decided which players fit into each. That said, it seems that the Cubs have been very intentional about pairing diversification of arms with balance as they&rsquo;ve built up the farm.</p>
<p>The only thing missing from the mix is the elusive Top of the Rotation starter. The Cubs passed on one such arm in 2013, but no one should be complaining about the addition of Kris Bryant instead of Jonathan Gray at this point. Not when Carlos Rodon, Tyler Kolek, Tyler Beede, Jeff Hoffman and Erik Fedde will all be available in the 2014 draft and carry #1 starter potential. Fortunately, the Cubs have the number 4 overall pick in June and seem poised to snag an ace in the making.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, There&rsquo;s no such thing as a (Cubs) pitching prospect.</p>
