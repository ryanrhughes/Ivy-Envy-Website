<p>On this bonus episode (and the last episode of Season 4 for the Ivy Envy Podcast), Joe Martin talks with me about the new spring training facility that the Cubs are building in Mesa, Arizona.  The Cubs have now played their last home Spring Training game at Hohokam Stadium.  </p>
<p>Joe did some coverage for us last year during Spring Training and is working for the Phoenix Business Journal.  He was able to attend an event with Tom Ricketts and other members of the Cubs front office about the new facility.  <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/03/13/chicago-cubs-give-construction-tour-of.html" target="_blank">Click here to read Joe's write-up on this press event.<br />
