  content: "A couple follow up notes on stuff we talked about.\r\nAaron Miles makes
    $2.2 million. COOP buyout not likely.\r\nPrince Fielder signed a two year, $18
    million contract in January.\r\nAlbert Pujols is hitting .325 overall, .368 with
    RISP and .667 with the bases loaded. 38 homers, 5 grand slams, 104 RBI...with
    43 games left to play. That's useful.\r\nFinally, we have seven ratings on itunes
    all with 5 stars. We're moving up."

<p>Corey, Andy, Kurt and Brian live up to our review by Thunder Matt's Saloon.&nbsp; The recent terrible play by the Cubs left us lost as we stumbled through this episode trying to take away something positive.&nbsp; We also get sidetracked and tell you what Cubs blogs we like.</p>
<p>You can see the next podcast taping.&nbsp; Come down to Twenty Sports Grille in Moline on Tuesday August 25th during the Cubs/Nationals game.&nbsp; Eat, drink and talk Cubs with us.&nbsp; At some point in the evening, we'll give away a $50 gift card to Twenty.</p>
<p>We forget to mention this, but we'd really like to thank Jason, who does all of our podcast recordings.&nbsp; He's very generous in doing this for us and we appreciate it tremendously.</p>
