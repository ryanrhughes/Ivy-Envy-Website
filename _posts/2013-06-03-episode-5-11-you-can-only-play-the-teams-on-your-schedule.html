<p>Here we are at episode 199 of the podcast.  Join us live this upcoming Saturday, June 8th for the 200th episode.  We'll be broadcasting it live in audio and video to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/live</a>.  We will open up the phone line and take your calls during the 200th episode.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about what has worked for the Cubs recently.  The Cubs provide some offense and the starting pitching (minus Edwin Jackson) keep things rolling.  We talk about what it would take for us to be depressed about the 2013 season.  </p>
<p>Then we go through listener submitted questions and topic suggestions.  </p>
<p>Here's the photo for this week's caption contest:</p>
