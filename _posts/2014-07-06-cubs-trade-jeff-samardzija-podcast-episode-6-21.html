<p><a href="/uploads/2014/07/WINNER-12.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/07/WINNER-12-300x300.png" alt="WINNER (12)" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10211" /></a>We knew it was going to happen, and it did.  The Cubs traded Jeff Samardzija (along with Jason Hammel) to the Oakland A's for prospects.  There are lots of aspects of the trade for us to discuss on this episode.  </p>
<p>We talk about Samardzija's years with the Cubs, how we heard about the trade, how Cubs fans reacted, how we reacted, who the Cubs will be getting in return, etc. </p>
<p>Jason McLeod withdraws his name from consideration for the San Diego Padres GM job and we talk about what that tells us about how people around baseball view the Cubs organization.  It's also a great sign for those that <del datetime="2014-07-07T03:51:13+00:00">like</del> love the direction of the organization.  </p>
<p>Andy talks about Jake Arrieta's last few starts and how great of a pitcher he's been, essentially becoming the Cubs new ace.  Three minor league players in the Cubs organization won Player of the Week awards in their leagues last week and we talk about the performances of Kyle Schwarber, Daury Torrez and Arismendy Alcantara.</p>
<p>We answer a good number of listener questions, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week (hint: spectacular Kris Bryant stats) and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
