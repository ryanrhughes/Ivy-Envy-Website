<p>We broadcast live and record on Tuesday evenings.  Since today is Christmas, we are doing something different this week.  In 2009, we did an off-season episode on baseball cards.  We pulled out our collections and conducted a tournament of goofy 80's baseball cards.  </p>
<p>This episode definitely has a visual element to it.  You can see the photos of all the cards we discuss by going to the original post - <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/cards" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/cards</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy this episode and Happy Holidays.  </p>
