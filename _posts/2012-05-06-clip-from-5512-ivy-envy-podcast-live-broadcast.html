  content: I've been in a room where someone has been mowing the grass outside and
    the mower has shot a rock through the window, so that's what I thought this was.&nbsp;

<p>Since we started doing live video broadcasts last month, I've been putting up clips on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RelentlessPodcasts?feature=mhee" target="_blank">Relentless Podcast Network channel on YouTube</a>.  This week's clip is much shorter than they usually are.  I typically select a particular discussion that is relevant to that week for these clips.  </p>
<p>This week, there was an incident in the studio that was much more entertaining than any spoken material we could come up with.  I think you'll enjoy each person's reaction.  </p>
