<p>On this episode, we start things off by reminiscing a little about the first 399 episodes of the podcast.  We spend a little time on the series with the Brewers that we just wanted to be over with.  Kurt previews the upcoming series with the Giants.  We answer some listener questions...deciding who is the best pinch hitter in Cubs history. We finish off the episode with a Rube Waddell story.</p>
