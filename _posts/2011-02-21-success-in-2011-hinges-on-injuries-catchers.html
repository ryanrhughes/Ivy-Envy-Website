<p>Geovany Soto recovered from his Sophomore Slump quite nicely in 2010.  The most significant area of improvement was the area that dropped off the most, his batting average.  Soto hit .280 in 2010 after an average of .218 in 2009.  His HR and RBI numbers didn't come close to what he produced in his All-Star/Rookie of the Year campaign in 2008.  One contributing factor is probably that Soto played in 36 fewer games in 2010 compared to 2008.  But, I think most Cubs fans would gladly take a .280 average with 17 HR's and 53 RBI's from a guy that is respectable defensively behind the plate.  Plus, no fan can deny Soto's man-scaping efforts.</p>

<p>Fans would also gladly take those numbers when the backup is a guy named Koyie Hill.  Hill is probably my least-favorite player on the Cubs.  I am guessing he ranks up there behind Samardzija for all of you.  Hill played in 77 games last year and boasted a batting average of .214 with 1 HR and 17 RBI's.  If you are thinking that 2010 was an anomaly, it wasn't.  Koyie Hill's career batting average is just one point higher, at .215.</p>

<p>I honestly didn't expect to see Koyie Hill back with the Cubs in 2011.  I assumed he would be tossed into a trade somewhere.  However, Jim Hendry rewarded Hill's .214 average by giving him a $150,000 raise for 2011.  Now, I know that $150,000 is pocket change when looking at the overall Cubs payroll.  The Cubs minor league system has some catchers in it, and why spend $850,000 on a guy that is frankly, not good when you can instead have a guy that earns a fraction of that?   Why not let the youth of your system get some big league experience.  They aren't going to be equal replacements for Soto, but neither is Koyie Hill.</p>
<p>Welington Castillo would have probably been able to fill in for Soto with the same results as Koyie Hill.  At this point, Castillo is probably best known for the shard of wood from his bat that pierced Tyler Colvin's chest.  He'd probably appreciate the opportunity to give Cubs fans a few more plays to recall when hearing his name.</p>

<p>Castillo will turn 24 in the first month of the season.  He's spent most of the season in Iowa last year, batting .255 with 13 HR and 59 RBI's.  He was called up to the Cubs when the roster expanded.  He played in 7 games with 20 at-bats.  He continued his reputation as a free-swinger with the Cubs by striking out in 7 of those plate appearances.  It's not really worth noting because it's such a small sample size, but out of his 6 hits, 4 were doubles and one was a homerun.  In his short stint with the big league club, Castillo batted .300.</p>
<p>While Geovany Soto isn't the biggest bat on the team, an injury to Soto would hurt the Cubs.  The offensive drop-off is substantial between Soto and Koyie Hill.  I would expect Castillo to be sent to Iowa and called up if Soto does sustain and injury that sends him to the Disabled List.  Apparently, the Cubs have more confidence in Koyie Hill than Castillo this year.  I have not seen Castillo play and I'm not fully aware of all of the areas of his game in which he needs to work.  Hopefully, Castillo can improve where the Cubs would like, gain some more big league experience and become the full-time backup catcher in 2012.</p>
