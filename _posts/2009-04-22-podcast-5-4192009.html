<p>A few days late thanks to technical issues.  Also, there's no intro/outro music and you'll have to excuse the distortion towards the end of the show.  Only two Ivy Envy writers are present, but John from <a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a> saves the day.</p>
