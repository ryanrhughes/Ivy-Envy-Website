<p>We have had Tim on the podcast several times and he's one of our favorite people to interview for Ivy Envy. </p>
<p>We met Tim and his wife after Tuesday's Cubs at a Sloan Park-area establishment for this conversation.  </p>
<p>Tim talks about his personal public addressing style, the benefits of the new Spring Training facility on the organization and he shares some thoughts on Cubs players and the 2015 team. </p>
