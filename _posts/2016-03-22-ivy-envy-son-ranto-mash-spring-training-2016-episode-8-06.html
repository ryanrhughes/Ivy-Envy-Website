  content: You've got some weird fuzz noise in this one that happens fairly often.
    This was another good episode, but the noise is distracting.

  content: Grabbed a bottle of the wine at Binny's when visiting Chicago last year,
    and...the bottle sure is nice to have on a shelf.

<p>On this episode, we invite Danny Rockett and Michael from Colorado to sit in on this episode with us.  These two are hosts of The Son Ranto Show, a fine Cubs podcast. </p>
<p>We're also joined mid-episode by podcast listener, Kris Bonner and his friend, Kyle (who happens to be a Dodgers fan). </p>
<p>We open up and taste a vintage 2012 Cubs wine, talk about the Spring Training experience, share a few stories and talk about our 2016 Cubs expectations.</p>
<p>Andy brings a few Rube Waddell stories and Corey shares some Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
