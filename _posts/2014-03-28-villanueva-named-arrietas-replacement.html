<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Carlos+Villanueva+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+QrCBCQ48G0Hl.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Carlos+Villanueva+Chicago+Cubs+Photo+Day+QrCBCQ48G0Hl-230x300.jpg" alt="Carlos Villanueva" width="230" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9201" /></a>Shortly after Jake Arrieta reported to Spring Training, we learned that he would not be starting the season as the #5 starter, but more likely starting 2014 on the disabled list.  Arrieta experienced discomfort in his shoulder and was delayed in his preparations for the season.  The Cubs delayed the decision until today, but <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceMiles2112" target="_blank">according to Bruce Miles</a>, named Carlos Villanueva as Arrieta's replacement.  </p>
<p>Villanueva appeared in 47 games in 2013 and 15 of those appearances were as a starter.  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/looking-cubs-5th-starter-spot/" target="_blank">Last week, I posted</a> that I would like to see Villanueva get this opportunity over the other option, Chris Rusin.  </p>
<p>After the Cubs announced the decision would be made this weekend, Chris Rusin fell apart in Wednesday's game against the Diamondbacks.  In 2<sup>2/3</sup> innings, Rusin gave up 9 runs, including four home runs.  I think Villanueva probably had the edge prior to that and that unfortunate performance sealed the deal.  </p>
<p>Chris Rusin now heads to Iowa. I like Rusin and I think we'll see him back up with the Cubs this year.  The reason I liked Villanueva to fill in for Arrieta is that I think if Villanueva can perform well in his roles as a starter and reliever, he will improve his value in a trade at some point this season.  Villanueva is in the last year of his 2-year contract and we know this front office will be shopping him.  </p>
<p>If all goes well with Arrieta, I'd expect we will see him in late April with Villanueva shifting back to the bullpen.  </p>
