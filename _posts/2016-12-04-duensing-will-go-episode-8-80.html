<p><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />On this, the 458th episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about some of the recent roster moves the Cubs have made.  The Cubs signed OF Jon Jay and LHP Brian Duensing to 1-year deals.  We also go through the players the Cubs non-tendered.  We are also guaranteed baseball in 2017 with the new collective bargaining agreement. Kurt goes over some of the highlights of this agreement. </p>
