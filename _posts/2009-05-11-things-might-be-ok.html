<p>It's an off day and I'm going to take a deep breath and relax.  After Ramirez went down, I was suddenly struck with panic.  That whole series in Milwaukee felt panicky.  It almost feels like we pulled off something by escaping the series without being swept.</p></p>
<p>I'm going to go against my instincts.  I'm going to be optimistic about where the Cubs stand.  It's in my nature to be a pessimist, but I really think things are going to be ok...in the short term, at least.  Let's forget all the injuries and how insanely unreliable the bullpen is.  And to merge the two, how about Chad Fox going on the 15 day DL after two appearances?  It seems that <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090510&amp;content_id=4658262&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">Fox's career is probably over</a>.  I'll miss Chad and his 135.00 ERA.</p></p>
<p>Let's be positive. The Cubs are only 2.5 games out of first place.  In the next week, the Cubs play San Diego and Houston.  San Diego...well, they're San Diego.  Houston is an 8-game losing streak by Pittsburgh from being in last place in the division. The Cubs are 4-1 against Houston this year.  I see this as an opportunity for guys to get healthy and the young/new guys to get it going.&nbsp; Also, let me remind you that the Cubs are 7-3 in the month of May.  I know it seems like the sky has fallen in the last four or five days, but if they keep plugging away and getting healthy, things will be fine.  The current lineup is still better than San Diego and Houston.</p></p>
