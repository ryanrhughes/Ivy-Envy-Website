  nationalistic person.&nbsp; The national anthem doesn't cause me to tear up.&nbsp;
  I could not care less if the United States wins medals.&nbsp; I just have no interest.&nbsp;

    The LLWS is fun to watch. I'm a little disappointed to see the boys from Curacao striking home run poses like Soriano.
    One of the kids' favorite player was Mike Fontenot.

<p>This is the last day of my summer vacation.&nbsp; I'm a little disappointed that the Cubs don't have a game today that I can savor as my last of the summer.&nbsp; These days off help a pitching staff, though.&nbsp; I suppose the health of the Cubs are more important than me having the luxury of lazily watching a game.&nbsp; I looked ahead on the calendar and I'm pretty pleased that out of the&nbsp;remaining 30 weekday games, the Cubs have&nbsp;23 night games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So on this last day of my vacation, I can't bring myself to watch the Olympics.&nbsp; I did watch some out at the bar with friends on Saturday night.&nbsp; I just can't do the Olympics.&nbsp; It might have something to do with the fact that I don't consider myself a terribly nationalistic person.&nbsp; The national anthem doesn't cause me to tear up.&nbsp; I could not care less if the United States wins medals.&nbsp; I just have no interest.&nbsp; But there were other people Saturday night that aren't nationalists at all and were cheering on Michael Phelps.&nbsp; I have two main issues with the Olympics:</p>
<p>#1.&nbsp; I believe that Olympians should compete naked.&nbsp; Ancient Olympic athletes competed in the nude and these games are a celebration of the human body in peak physical condition.&nbsp; Now, I think this should be limited to <a id="more"></a><a id="more-186"></a>sports that are the traditional events.&nbsp; The original Olympics didn't have sports like Basketball, Field Hockey and Baseball.&nbsp; I don't think it's safe for basketball players to play nude.&nbsp; Plus, it'd be really hard to find a guy willing to be the catcher for the Olympic baseball team.&nbsp; I also think there should be an exception for sand volleyball.&nbsp; Those bodies are chiseled, but the sand could become problematic.&nbsp; Nudity in the Olympics would probably require an adjustment in technique from males more so than females.&nbsp; For example, think of the Pummel Horse competition.</p>
<p>#2.&nbsp; I just can't stomach the&nbsp;coverage of the Olympics.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before we see&nbsp;him compete in the long jump, let's learn a little more about him".&nbsp; Then we have to&nbsp;hear about how his sister's dog&nbsp;died when he&nbsp;was 7 and how it's&nbsp;shaped his life and is&nbsp;his motivation.&nbsp;&nbsp;NBC must only allow athletes to go to the Olympics that have a story that will sell in their coverage.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I'm going to watch sports, I want to see competition.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;want to know anything about anyone.&nbsp; I want to know them as an athlete, not as a person.&nbsp; If you want that stuff, watch Oprah&nbsp;or The&nbsp;View.&nbsp; This is exactly why I couldn't watch much of the&nbsp;Home Run Derby this year.&nbsp; I don't care what Josh Hamilton went through.&nbsp; Good for him for beating his addictions, but I turned it on to see some home runs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason I even turned it on is that I&nbsp;have come to realize that if I watch a broadcast with Chris Berman, I feel better about myself after listening to that giant dickweed.&nbsp; I don't want to hear about anything personal about any athlete, ever.&nbsp; I mean, unless these dudes are Jim Abbot and playing with one hand or something, I just don't care.</p>
<p>So instead of watching the Olympics, I will watch as much of the Little League World Series as I can.&nbsp; I loved watching the LLWS when I was in Little League and dreamed of playing on a field where the fence wasn't 285 feet down the lines and 315 feet to straight-away center.&nbsp; Plus they got to play on a grass infield with a mound!&nbsp; Where I grew up, you didn't want to slide into any base because you'd spend the next inning pulling pebbles out of your leg with tweasers.&nbsp; I found a new appreciation for the LLWS during the Dusty Baker years with the Cubs, though.&nbsp; It was just so refreshing to turn&nbsp;on a baseball game in August and watch 12 year olds play fundamentally sound baseball when the Cubs were having trouble running the bases and hitting cut-off men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So until the Olympics are ready to force swimmers to become not so streamlined and deal with a little bit of drag and NBC will report on the sports and stop forcing sappy stories down my throat, I will watch the Little League World Series and watch kids that were born the year I graduated High School play baseball, knowing full well that I could probably not get a base hit off them.</p>
