<p>This upcoming Cubs vs. Rays series is probably the most interesting series of the season thus far.&nbsp; And it will hold that title until this weekend when the White Sox stroll into Wrigley.&nbsp; I wouldn't have imagined in April that this series could be this interesting.&nbsp; But here we are in mid-June <a id="more"></a><a id="more-98"></a>and the Cubs are 20 games over .500 and facing a Rays team that is 2 games out of first place in the mighty American League East and sitting at 11 games over .500.&nbsp; It's hard enough for me to grasp the fact that the Cubs are 20 games over .500.&nbsp; And the Rays are a franchise that have only seen .500 ball a handful of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a different Rays team.&nbsp; They have the third best home record at 26-11.&nbsp; Now I'm not saying the Rays will necessarily be in the thick of things come October, but this is isn't late April.&nbsp; It's mid-June and I wouldn't put the Rays in the "Fraud" category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Lou built this team to win and they&nbsp;have some GOOD young talent.&nbsp; So now Lou goes home to Tampa.&nbsp; He's like the guy that has a slightly dorky girlfriend in high school, but by dating him, she gained some confidence and became pretty popular.&nbsp; That girl is the Tampa Bay Rays.&nbsp; She was only a sophomore and he went away to the state university.&nbsp; She becomes popular and pretty, but then Lou comes back over fall break from college and he brings this gorgeous sorority girl back that he's dating.&nbsp; That gorgeous sorority girl is the Cubs.&nbsp; So I expect to see some awkward situations and a little jealousy this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next two weeks will be really interesting.&nbsp; Half of the games are against the South Siders who are in first place in the AL Central.&nbsp; 3 games are against the up and comers of the AL East.&nbsp; And I will be attending one of the games of the Cubs vs. Orioles series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go Cubs.</p>
