<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt force themselves to sit down and talk about the last week in Cubs baseball.  After a 1-4 week, it's hard to do anything but look at what is going wrong with this team.  Defense, pitching, hitting...that pretty much sums it up.  </p>
<p>We also discuss the high amount of roster moves the Cubs have made in the first few weeks of the 2013 season.  Corey runs through the moves and Andy puts it into context by comparing the number of moves to the other teams in the National League Central.  </p>
<p>We take a quick run through the Cubs Minor League System, from Kane County to Daytona to Tennessee to Iowa.  There's some good and some bad in this trip through the farm system.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week, Andy finds an Internet Muscle Flex of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
