  content: This series has me worried about the bullpen's ability to throw strikes.
    I wasn't impressed with Mateo. He seems to be the favorite for first guy in. Hopefully
    he'll settle in and throw strikes. The Cubs got some help from an even worse Diamondback
    pen.

  content: "In the SI MLB preview issue Castro made a comment about always wanting
    to make contact with the ball, which is relieving.  Plus, it's not like he's going
    to hit .400 all season long anyways.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

WP - Wells (1-0)<br />
LP - Saunders (0-1)<br />
S - Marmol (2)</p>
<p>The Cubs welcomed the Arizona Diamondbacks to a chilly Wrigley Field and reached the .500 mark on the season by beating the Diamondbacks 4-1.  Randy Wells got his first start of the season and went 6 innings, giving up 1 run on 6 hits.  Things didn't look good early on as Wells served up a homerun to the Diamondbacks leadoff hitter, Willie Bloomquist and then a single to the next batter, Kelly Johnson.  But Wells settled in and pitched fairly well the rest of the game.  He did have shaky 4th and 5th innings, walking two batters in each inning.  Offensively, the Cubs relied on a few of the more veteran players to carry the team.  Starlin Castro went hitless for the first time in 2011.  Aramis Ramirez, Geovany Soto and Alfonso Soriano all collected 2 hits apiece.  Soriano hit his 2nd homerun in as many days and Soto had two doubles.</p>

WP - Russell (1-0)<br />
LP - Demel (1-1)<br />
S - Marshall (1)</p>
<p>Andrew Cashner earned the 5th rotation spot in Spring Training and started his first Major League game.  Cashner pitched to contact and looked very solid in his 5 1/3 inning outing.  Cashner had the Diamondbacks grounding out early and often.  Cashner threw 72 pitches and his groundball to flyball count was 9-4.  Only two of the batters that Cashner faced got to their third ball in the count.  One of those was  that last he faced, Willie Bloomquist.  After he walked Bloomquist, the Cubs Trainer, Mark O'Neil came out to the mound and Cashner was lifted with stiffness in his right shoulder.  Cashner gave up 1 run on 2 hits in his 5 1/3 innings of work.  When he left, the Cubs had a 4-1 lead.  Jeff Samaradzija replaced Cashner and continued his career-long struggles with finding the strike-zone.  Samardzija lasted one inning, walking two of the five batters he faced.  He did not give up any hits and had two strikeouts, but he gave up 2 runs.</p>
<p>With Tyler Colvin getting the start at 1st base, Tuesday's line-up gave us a glimpse at what could be the future Cubs infield.  Aramis Ramirez was the old man with the rest of the infield consisting of Tyler Colvin, Darwin Barney and Starlin Castro.  Add Andrew Cashner on the mound and it really could be the infield that Cubs fans will see for a while (minus Ramirez?).  At different points of the game, this infield looked sharp.  There was a play in the 9th with the game on the line when a hard-hit bouncer up the middle ricocheted off Sean Marshall's glove and Starlin Castro made an incredible bare-handed play to nail former Cub Cliffy Six Nad (Clifford Xavier Nady VI) at first.  While Nady may have in fact been safe, it was a remarkable play by Castro, as well as Colvin as he dug it out of the dirt.  Another defensive play that stood out was a 3-6-1 double play involving James Russell.</p>
<p>Offensively, the Cubs hit the ball pretty well considering it was another chilly early-April afternoon.  The Cubs racked up 10 hits off the weak Diamondback pitching.  Starlin Castro rebounded from his hitless day on Monday and went 2-5 with a double, a run scored and an RBI.  Tyler Colvin hit his first homerun of the year in the 3rd inning.  Colvin also walked with the bases loaded in the 7th inning to score Starlin Castro.  Colvin ended the day with 3 RBI's.</p>
<p><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_06_arimlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=box" target="_blank">Wednesday April 6th &ndash; Cubs 4 Diamondbacks 6</a><br />
WP &ndash; Galarraga (1-0)<br />
LP &ndash; Dempster (0-2)<br />
S &ndash; Putz (2)</p>
<p>The Cubs struggled offensively against Armando Galarraga.  Through 3 innings, it looked like the Cubs would give Galarraga the no-hitter that he was robbed of last year.  In the 4th inning, Aramis Ramirez hit his first homerun and registered his first RBIs of the season, knocking in Marlon Byrd, who singled to register the first Cubs hit of the day.  The Diamondbacks yanked the momentum away from the Cubs by scoring 3 runs in the top of the 5th inning.  The only glimpse of hope for the rest of the game was Soriano&rsquo;s solo shot in the 7th inning.  This homerun gave Soriano 3 HR and 5 RBIs on the season.</p>
<p>Other than the homeruns by Ramirez and Soriano, the only real bright spots on the day were the multi-hit performances by Kosuke Fukudome and Marlon Byrd.  In the 8th inning, Soriano struck out, leaving the tying run at 2nd base.  Defensively, the Cubs looked out-of-sync and registered three errors.  Soriano continued his miserable play in the field allowing 3 runs off his miscues.</p>
<p>Ryan Dempster did not benefit from the poor defense, but also did pitch particularly well.  Dempster was able to stay in the game 7 innings, but gave up 10 hits and 5 runs, 4 of which were earned.  Dempster didn&rsquo;t walk anyone and struck out six.  Dempster exited the game with his season ERA at 6.59.  Rookie Marcos Mateo came in the 9th inning with runners on 1st and 3rd with no outs and retired three straight and kept the Diamondbacks from tacking on insurance runs.</p>

<p><strong>Is Anyone Out There?</strong><br />
If you were watching this series, the most glaring aspect of this game was the lack of fans in the stands.  The official average attendance for the series was 28,534, but I'd love to have an inside source that knows exactly how many people were at these games.  It was MUCH below the paid attendance figures.  Monday&rsquo;s attendance number was 26,292, the lowest attended home game for the Cubs in 9 years.  You'll hear people blame it being on a weekday series in early April, or the weather - but there's more going on.  We had 2 tickets for this game to give away at our event and struggled to find someone willing to take free tickets.  It's bad for the Ricketts' or fans that want the team to make lots of money to spend on Albert Pujols.  It&rsquo;s good for the average fan that feels the tickets are over-priced or fans that seem to take pleasure in the Cubs&rsquo; struggles.  The fact of the matter is, average fans are not excited with this team.  They don't get excited about young talent coming up through the system.  They get excited by a dominant Zambrano or a Slammin' Sammy.  In some ways, a weeding out of fair-weather fans is not a bad thing, but they&rsquo;ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>Playing Heads-Down Baseball</strong><br />
Kosuke Fukudome typically plays very smart baseball, but in Tuesday's game, Fukudome ran right through 3rd base coach Ivan DeJesus' stop sign with his head down and was gunned down at the plate.  This is not typical of Fukudome and I doubt if these types of moves will help his case for playing time considering the play of Tyler Colvin.  I still think Quade knows that Fukudome starts strong and there is no reason to have him sitting on the bench during the only time of the season that he plays well.</p>
<p><strong>Above .500!</strong><br />
The Cubs had not been above .500 since the final game of the 2009 season.  It had been 166 games and 547 days since the Cubs were above .500 when they rose above the mark on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Starlin Comes Back to Earth</strong><br />
In his 2nd at-bat of Wednesday&rsquo;s game, Starlin Castro had his first swing and miss of the game.  Let that sink in.  It took 25 at-bats for Starlin Castro to swing and not hit the ball.  Castro cooled slightly in this series.  He went a combined 2-12 in the series, dropping his season average to .400.</p>
<p><strong>Injury Bug Bites</strong><br />
40% of the starting rotation went to the Disabled List during this series.  Andrew Cashner left Tuesday&rsquo;s game early, experiencing tightness in his shoulder.  MRI results showed a rotator cuff strain.  Randy Wells joined Cashner on the DL with a forearm strain.  Quade plans to have the duo back in 3-4 weeks.  In the meantime, the Cubs are expected to call up Casey Coleman from Iowa.  The other spot can be filled by James Russell, Sean Marshall or Jeff Samardzija (sorry, had to lighten the mood).</p>
