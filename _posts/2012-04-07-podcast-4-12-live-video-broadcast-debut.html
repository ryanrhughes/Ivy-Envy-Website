  content: Kerry Wood was always a fan favorite, but trust me if he keeps this up
    he'll be on their bad side.&nbsp; Hopefully Kerry Wood won't become in May what
    Mark Sanchez will become in October.&nbsp;

    Our over/unders are going to be way off this year.&nbsp; I can already guarantee you that.&nbsp; To be honest, Saturday Wood looked quite good for the first two outs of that inning but then he let a pitch get away from him and it became an opposite field home run.&nbsp; But WE WERE still fine at that point.&nbsp; We were still up 4-3 as it was only a solo home run, and things looked to be still within control.&nbsp; But then&nbsp;before you new it they had two baserunners and had to be pulled.&nbsp; And Wood WAS pulled at the moment that he should have been, as it was clear he was spiraling out of control.&nbsp; Unbeknownst to us, the spiral had just begun and Carlos Marmol was preeped to come in and extend our misery.&nbsp; Just a frustrating last couple of innings to watch overall.
    &nbsp;
    Now Samardzjia looked about as good as anybody on our roster can look.&nbsp; And I liked that after he raised a stink about being part of the starting rotation, that he ACTUALLY CAME OUT THERE AND DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT IN HIS FIRST START OF THE SEASON.&nbsp; A lot of guys don't do that...they talk a ton of shit and then they get out there and we see exactly why they were in the predicament that they were originally bitching about being in to begin with.&nbsp; Jeff didn't do that.&nbsp; It's just one game, but he sent a message to everybody in the clubhouse:&nbsp; "Look, I'm not fucking around.&nbsp; I deserve to be in the middle of the rotation.&nbsp; Watch"&nbsp;

<p>This episode is the first of our weekly live video broadcasts.  From here on out, you can go to www.ivyenvy.com and click on the "Live Broadcast" button on the page and watch a video stream of our podcast recording.</p>
<p>On this episode, we talk about the first game of the 2012 season.  Will there ever be a time when we as Cubs fans couldn't fill an entire episode with complaints about the bullpen?  Ryan Dempster has an incredible performance wiped away by Kerry Wood and Carlos Marmol. </p>
<p>Since this is the first episode of the 2012 season, we look at some statistical categories and predict the over/under on the results.  Marmol saves, bullpen blown saves, LaHair and Soriano HRs, Castro errors, and dates on call-ups and trades.  </p>
<p>Then we end the show with the weekly photo caption contest and pick a winner for the book <uRon Santo: A Perfect 10</u>, which is signed by radio voice of the Chicago Cubs, Pat Hughes, and co-author Rich Wolfe.  </p>
