<p style="text-align: left;">The last page of my son's <em>Chicago Cubs ABC</em> book.&nbsp; It's important to teach your children now what they should expect from Soriano since they will be adults when his contract comes off the books.&nbsp; "Son, when this guy comes to the plate, you can expect a gaping black-hole of a strike zone and plenty of zeroes (on the scoreboard).&nbsp; Also, be on the lookout for those zigzaggers heading for the infield."</p></p>
