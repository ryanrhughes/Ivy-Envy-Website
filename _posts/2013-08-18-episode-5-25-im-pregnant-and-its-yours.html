<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt spend a good portion of this episode talking about Starlin Castro's most recent gaffe.  Castro was benched by Dale Sveum and regardless of where each Cubs fan stands with Castro, you probably had an opinion on this situation.  There are lots of angles to look at and on top of sharing our opinions, we read many comments from listeners on Castro and Saturday's situation.  </p>
