<p>This is the third episode in a series of bonus interview episodes.  On this episode, we have an interview that Andy and I did with Brian Bedo of MiCubs.  </p>
<p>We've had Brian on the podcast a few times and if you are interested in the Cubs organization from the ground up, MiCubs.com is a great site to be reading.  They in-depth analysis of the entire minor league organization through posts on their site and podcast episodes, MiCubs keeps you up to date with everything going on in the system.</p>
<p>Brian Bedo is not just the founder of MiCubs.com, but he is also a sports producer for WGN radio, producing cubs, Blackhawks and Northwestern Wildcats games and post-game shows.  </p>
<p>So here is our conversation with Brian Bedo.</p>
