<p>On this episode we comment on Anthony Rizzo's new contract, which was reported during our last episode.  Thanks to everyone that tweeted at us and alerted us on Facebook.  Sorry we missed it at the time.  Is this a good deal for the Cubs?  Is it a good deal for Rizzo?  Is Rizzo a cornerstone of the organization?</p>
<p>Matt Garza will be returning to the Cubs and Carlos Villanueva is being sent to the bullpen.  We talk about the rotation and the future of players like Matt Garza and Scott Feldman.  </p>
<p>We go through a list of listener questions.  We ask for those with a status on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> the day of our recordings.  </p>
<p>Kurt give us a (good) Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  It was very difficult this week with so many great entries.  We also really enjoy all of the Arby's references with Ian Stewart.  </p>
