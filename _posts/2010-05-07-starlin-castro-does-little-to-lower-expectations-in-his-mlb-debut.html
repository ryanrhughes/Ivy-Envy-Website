  content: "I was totally driving home tonight thinking about posting a column and
    then I was like...\"I bet ANYTHING Corey's already done one...LOL\r\n\r\nBut seriously
    man I was impressed.  It's not like the Reds have the same Pitching staff that
    the Giants do, but 6 RBIs in your major league debut is throwing the hammer down
    and I don't care who you're playing.  \r\n\r\nGoofy looking dude but he seems
    to really have his head on straight.  At least he did tonight.  Let's hope this
    is what he is really capable of instead of just a freak on the control chart."

<p>Starlin Castro became the first player in Major League Baseball history to drive in 6 runs in their debut game.  So much for Cubs fans having realistic expectations for Castro.&nbsp; With his performance tonight, he made realistic expectations anything but possible.</p>
<p>Less than 12 hours from waking up to a phone call telling him to pack his bags, Castro ended the day at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, going 2-5 with a triple, a homerun and SIX RBI's.  SIX!  That is more RBI's in a debut game than anyone in MLB history.  That's how many suddenly displaced Mike Fontenot had in 23 games, prior (oh, is the word "Prior" taboo when discussing rookie phenoms?) to tonight's grand slam .  That's more than Cliffy Six Nad (21 games) and Jeff Baker (16 games) have in 2010.</p>
<p>Enjoy it for an evening, Cubs fans.  Castro will bring us back to reality.  But what is that reality?  Tune in to the Ivy Envy Podcast coming out this weekend to hear what Matt Swain from <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/blogs/chicago-cubs-wrigley-bound/" target="_blank">Wrigleybound</a> thinks Castro is capable of in the majors.</p>
