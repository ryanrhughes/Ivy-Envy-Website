<p>Opening Day for Major League Baseball is this Thursday.&nbsp; This will be our third season of inviting our readers and listeners to join us in our MLB Final Standings Challenge.&nbsp; All you need to do is e-mail your prediction of what the standings will look like at the end of the season for every division.&nbsp; If you want, you can throw in the awards winners or playoff results.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, I will post everyone's predictions.&nbsp; We will have some sort of prize for the winner.&nbsp; It's six months away, we'll come up with something between now and then.&nbsp; So go ahead and e-mail your standings in to me - corey@ivyenvy.com.</p>
