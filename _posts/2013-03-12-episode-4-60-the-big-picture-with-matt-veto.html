<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt are joined by our former regular guest, Matt Veto.  Matt now lives in Missouri and is attending grad school.  He comes back on the podcast to talk "big picture" topics with us.  </p>
<p>Before we get to that discussion, we look at some of the individual players and their performances so far this Spring.  We also talk about the number of Cubs players that will be returning to action from injuries this week.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have clearly made some changes and they're looking at making more major changes over the next few years.  We have talked about the Wrigley renovations and the uniform changes that the Cubs are considering.  A month or two ago, Matt made the prediction that the Cubs would soon have a mascot and with some of the news that came out this week, it appears that he might be right.  Matt goes on to make a couple of other predictions.  </p>
<p>We cover a lot in this episode, from signage to renovations to rooftops to "family-friendly".  If you have any thoughts on these topics, we'd love to hear them.  You can post them in the comment section under this post on our website, or you can comment under the post for this episode on our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> or <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/google." target="_blank">Google+ page</a>.  </p>
