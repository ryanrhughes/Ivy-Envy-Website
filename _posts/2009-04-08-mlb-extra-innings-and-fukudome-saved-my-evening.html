  content: I was able to watch most of it on the Comcast Sports Network before I had
    to go to dinner. The offense was great, but I really don't want to see a season
    of 11-6 games. Too stressful.

  content: BTW, thanks for the invite. I didn't get the message until late. I was
    able to watch it on DISH network. I think the Hawks were on the regular CSN, but
    they air an HD alternate channel that showed it.

<p>Thank you MLB Extra Innings.&nbsp; Why in the world is the third game of the season unavailable to everyone?&nbsp; So I sat outside all evening in the chilly April air to watch my Cubs.&nbsp; I ended up with a small gathering of die-hards that couldn't go an evening without their Boys in Blue.</p>
<p>This is exactly the game I have been waiting for from Fukudome.&nbsp; I don't know if he'll pan out, but like I said in the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=476">third episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast</a>, I want him to succeed.&nbsp; I like him.&nbsp; 4-5 with a HR, Double, Stolen Base and 4 Runs scored.&nbsp; That's probably the best game I've seen from him.&nbsp; I know that as Cubs fans we've become fickle, demanding perfect and winning baseball, but I'm trying to put that behind me.&nbsp; I want to pull for our guys, whether they play well or not.&nbsp; As long as Fukudome wears that "C" on his hat, I am pulling for the dude.&nbsp; From what I saw of him tonight, he looked in control both at the plate and in the field.</p>
<p>I don't want to rub it in to everyone that was unable to see the game, but that offensive explosion tonight, particularly in the first few innings was thoroughly enjoyable.&nbsp; I can't look past the 4 RBI apiece from Fontenot and Ramirez, but I think the night belonged to Fukudome.</p>
