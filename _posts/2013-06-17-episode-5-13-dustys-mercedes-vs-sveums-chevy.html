<p>Corey and Kurt handle this episode on their own as Andy has been suspended for a late-night Twitter tirade, claiming that Corey is letting him rot in a different studio.  </p>
<p>We talk a little more about the 2013 MLB draft.  Ian Stewart is suspended and we look at his intentions and what the future holds for him.  Corey gives some scary stats by looking at the Cubs record vs the NL Central and the other divisions.  Then we answer some listener questions, including one that asks if Sveum's management of the bullpen is worse than Dusty's management of the starts during his tenure with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>We play an interview from <a href="http://theminorleaguereport.com" target="_blank">The Minor League Report Podcast</a>, which is part of <a href="http://spnt.tv" target="_blank">SPNT Podcast Network</a>.  The guys at MLR interview Robbie Aaron, the Director of Broadcasting and Media Relations with the Daytona Cubs.  In this interview, Robbie talks about Javier Baez, Jorge Soler, which player in the Cubs system deserves to be moved up from their current placement and Robbie answers the question, "When will the Cubs be competitive?"  Thanks to MLR and SPNT for allowing us to use this interview.</p>
