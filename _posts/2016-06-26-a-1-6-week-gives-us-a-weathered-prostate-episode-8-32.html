What a terrible week of Cubs baseball.  On this, the 410th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about this 1-6 week. I can't say I expected us to have a 1-6 week to talk about with the 2016 Cubs.  </p>
<p>We use this episode to look at what has gone wrong over the last month of Cubs baseball.  On June 1st, their winning percentage was .708 and it's now about 60 points lower.  So why is that?  We look at offense, pitching and defense.  </p>
<p>In an attempt to stay positive, we also look at some positives.  In the month, the Cubs have a 13-11 record, so some things are going well.  </p>
<p>We answer a few listener questions, one of them on Heyward's offensive production.  After a scary stat of the week, we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
