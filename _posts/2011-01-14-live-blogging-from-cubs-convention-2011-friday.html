4:37 pm - Hour and 20 minutes in.  140 dollars down. Time for the first adult beverage.<br />
4:50 pm - Doug Glanville... Really???  Have a captain and coke. It's only ten dollars.<br />
5:13 pm - First Woo-Woo encounter. Opening Ceremonies in 2 minutes<br />
5:23 pm - Moment of silence for phil and ron. Now introductions. The crowd loves the Sarge. I love Bill Buckner.<br />
5:32 pm - It appears we have 3 guys left in our farm system. On the bright side Matt Garza is here.<br />
5:35 pm - Marlon Byrd gets a huge ovation. Well deserved!<br />

6:48 pm - Things have cooled as the autograph hunt/session is coming to an end. Waiting on Randy Hundley now.<br />
6:57 pm - Drunk guy screams "ahh Biiiill Buuckkner" in his autograph line. It is hard to see who is sitting at each table. Poor Billy Buck.<br />
