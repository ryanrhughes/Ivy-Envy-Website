The Cubs made several moves this week and we run through them. The most notable of these would be the signing of former Cardinals closer, Jason Motte. The Cubs also signed a back-up catcher that will probably serve as Jon Lester's personal catcher, David Ross.</p>
<p>We announce the winner of the 2015 Cubs Convention passes and read the winning entry. It was very difficult decision and we were blown away by the number and quality of entries.</p>
<p>There are several listener questions to answer, and we try to do just that. Andy wraps up by reading an internet muscle flex.</p>
