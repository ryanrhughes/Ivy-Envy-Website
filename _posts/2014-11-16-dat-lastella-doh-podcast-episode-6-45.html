A few hours before we recorded this episode, the Cubs traded Arodys Vizcaino back to the Braves for 2<sup>nd</sup> baseman, Tommy LaStella. We discuss why the Cubs may have made this trade and what it may (or may not) signal as far as bigger deals the Cubs are setting up.  </p>
<p>Baseball Prospectus released their Top 10 Cubs prospects list this week.  We were a little surprised that Addison Russell was ranked #1 over Kris Bryant and talk about why Russell earned the top spot.  In this discussion, I mentioned an episode of Effectively Wild.  <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=25050" target="_blank">You can find that episode here</a>.  </p>
<p>We talk about the general hype that the Cubs have started to get and talk about how that may expand in the future.  This conversation comes up because the Cubs/Cardinals Opening Day game has been moved to primetime, the night before.  </p>
<p>We also answer a bunch of listener questions, some focusing on Russell Martin and the free agent pitchers the Cubs are rumored to be leaders on.</p>
