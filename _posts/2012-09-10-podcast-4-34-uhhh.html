<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt keep trudging along, talking about the Cubs in the last month of what could be a historically bad Cubs season.  We talk about the Cubs and Nationals scuffling, whether or not the Cubs will set the record for the most franchise losses in the 2012 season, the current pitching staff and what the Cubs will do with the 2013 rotation and the Boise's appearance in the Northwest League's Championship Series and what it means for the future of the Cubs.  Then we dive into the Adam Greenberg story and discuss if he should be give one more at-bat.  </p>
<p>We go through a bunch of listener submitted topics and questions, pick a winner for this week's caption contest and Kurt gives us his scary stat of the week.  </p>
