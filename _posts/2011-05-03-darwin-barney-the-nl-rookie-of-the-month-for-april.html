<p>Darwin Barney came into Spring Training, fought his way onto the Cubs roster and earned the role as the starting 2nd baseman.  Today, Barney was named the <u>National League Rookie of the Month</u> for April.  </p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2011/05/darwin-barney-cubs-187.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2011/05/darwin-barney-cubs-187.jpg" alt="" title="Darwin Barney" width="187" height="251" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5178" /></a></center></p>
<p>In the month of April, Barney hit safely in 17 of his 20 starts.  He finished the month batting .326 with 1HR, 4 doubles, 2 triples and 14 RBIs.  Barney has settled in well at the two-hole.  In the 1st inning, Barney is hitting .389 with a .421 OBP.   He's also shown that he can knock guys in, which is something this team has needed.  Barney hit .500 with runners in scoring position in April.  Barney has been one of the most reliable players for the Cubs at the plate and he's been consistent on the base-paths and in the field.  </p>
<p>With Darwin Barney earning this award and Starlin Castro being named the National League Player of the Week about a month ago, you can't help but see the silver lining in this team and hold some hope for the future.  Darwin Barney isn't going to carry a team, but he's playing his role and you have to love a guy that works hard to get there.  </p>
