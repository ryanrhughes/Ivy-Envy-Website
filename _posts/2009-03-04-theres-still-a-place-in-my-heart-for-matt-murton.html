<p>Before I gush over Matt Murton, let me just say that I feel rattled staring at my first substantive post in months in the eyes.&nbsp; It's the same feeling I got when we first started up Ivy Envy.&nbsp; I'm an awkward virgin teenager fumbling with the bra-straps of the blogging world.</p>

<p>After an unproductive 2008 season (remember his extra base hit drought?) spent with the Cubs and Oakland A's, Murton headed to Venezuela for Winter Ball.&nbsp; In 15 games, Murton hit .321 with 2 Hr's and 15 RBI's.&nbsp; Though he did not get<a id="more"></a><a id="more-319"></a> a lot of playing time in 2008, his performance at the plate really seemed out of character to me.&nbsp; At the time, I wondered if someone in the Cubs system was trying to change his swing.&nbsp; It appears that Clint Hurdle and the Rockies intend to let Matt do what comes natural to him.</p>
<p>I had planned on hitting a Diamondbacks game on my way back from California this summer, but if Murton earns a spot in the outfield for the Rockies this season, I may just have to come back through Denver and watch the Rockies take on the Braves instead, right before the All-Star Break.</p>
<p>Good luck, Matt.&nbsp; Here at Ivy Envy, you'll always wear a Cubs uniform.</p>
