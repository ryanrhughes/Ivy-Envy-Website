<p>*&nbsp; What a homestand!&nbsp; The Cubs went 7-0.&nbsp; What impresses me most about the Cubs sweeping the Dodgers and the Rockies is that all 7 games were tight baseball games.&nbsp; This team continues <a id="more"></a><a id="more-92"></a>to show that they can win close games and come from behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Jim Edmonds came alive for a few games.&nbsp; For the Rockies series, Edmonds went 5-7 with a double, a triple and a homerun.&nbsp; He knocked in 5 RBI's.&nbsp; What is more impressive is that he drew a walk and did not strikeout.&nbsp; He has raised his season batting average about 45 points and is actually near .200.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since joining the Cubs, his batting average is .258 and his on-base percentage is .303.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I'm glad the Cubs are hitting the road.&nbsp; They have obviously proven they can win at home, going 26-8 at Wrigley.&nbsp; They are 10-13 on the road&nbsp;and I'd like to see if they can remedy that.&nbsp; I won't be looking forward to games starting at 9pm, but with a 3 week old baby, staying up late shouldn't be a problem.&nbsp;</p>
