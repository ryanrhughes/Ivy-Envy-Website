    inspiring that the Cubs were able to mount some kind of a rally and only lose
    9-7, but I also found it to be kind of a left-handed handjob as well.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want to have to give them credit, but at the same time Andy's right, it
    could be a lot worse.  Byrd and Colvin are showing some real signs of promise,
    and you can't help but feel after the way June ended that there is nowhere to
    go but up.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>Even though the Cubs lost last night, I'll be damned if they aren't playing some entertaining baseball right now.&nbsp; I know the D-backs are terrible, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; I've still just had fun watching the Cubs play baseball, and watching the Diamondbacks play makes me feel a little better about the Cubs.&nbsp; On one of the telecasts, Bob Brenly mentioned that the D-backs bullpen would have to pitch fifty scoreless innings to lower their league-worst ERA to match that of the next worst club.&nbsp; Our old buddy Aaron Heilman must've taken that statement as a challenge to make their failure even more epic, so he gave up a two-run homer to Aramis Ramirez in the 8th inning of Tuesday night's game. &nbsp; Nice to see him finally helping the Cubs.</p>
<p>There are some good things happening with the Cubs right now.&nbsp; They've dug their hole deep enough that it probably doesn't matter, but as I mentioned before, at least it makes it tolerable to watch them and even enjoy the game.&nbsp; Though he winces on every swing-and-a-miss, Aramis Ramirez seems to finally be coming to life.&nbsp; With every at-bat though, it does seem like he is one funky swing away from the DL again.&nbsp; Soto is playing well--he has been a force to be reckoned with at the plate lately.&nbsp; I hope they hang on to Soto when they think about rebuilding this team.&nbsp; I know many probably don't agree with me, but I think he is a good player who has the potential to be great still.&nbsp; Fukudome has also been hitting for power lately which is nice to see.&nbsp; And speaking of power, seeing Soriano's homer in last night's game was a thrill.&nbsp; It was a no-doubter off the bat that unfortunately didn't seem to spark the offense like it should have.</p>

<p>So they went on to lose the game.&nbsp; And in the top of the ninth, good-guy Marlon Byrd got ejected from the game by the first base umpire, Hunter Wendelstedt.&nbsp; This whole situation was the biggest pile of horsecrap that I've seen since the referees in the World Cup disallowed two good U.S. goals.&nbsp; First, the home plate ump called two low-and-outside pitches strikes.&nbsp; The second called strike was so erroneous that the fans in the 20th deck of Dodger stadium could have discerned that it was a ball.&nbsp; And I have to hand it to Byrd here.&nbsp; He instantly took a short walk away from the plate to collect himself, and when he walked back toward the plate, he was upset yet under control.&nbsp; For whatever reason, I became a very good lip-reader here, and Byrd was saying, "Unbelievable.&nbsp; That wasn't even close."&nbsp; As far as I could tell, he didn't bring the F-bomb into it at all.&nbsp; Byrd then checked his swing on the next low-and-away pitch and it was called a swing by Wendelstedt, making it a strikeout.</p>
<p>At this point, Bob Brenly cracked me up by saying that not only do the Cubs have to cover the plate against 100-mph-pitching Broxton, but they have to "cover six inches off the plate and below the knees" as well.&nbsp; Byrd got kicked out of the game while he was walking back to the dugout, muttering to himself.&nbsp; This would have been a great time for Piniella to freak out, but instead he just went out and got mildly agitated with Wendelstedt.&nbsp; Then to top the whole thing off, Brenly said something to the effect of, "You think this is bad?&nbsp; Wait till you see Hunter Wedelstedt behind the plate tomorrow."&nbsp; So that game ended up being pretty entertaining for a 3-2 loss.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to tonight's game.</p>
