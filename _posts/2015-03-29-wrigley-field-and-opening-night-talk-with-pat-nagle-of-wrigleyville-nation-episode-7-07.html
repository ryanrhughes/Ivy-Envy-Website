Opening Night is just one week away.  Cubs fans are more than ready for the 2015 season, but unfortunately Wrigley Field is not.  </p>
<p>On this week's episode, we talk with Pat Nagle, who is one of the co-hosts of <a href="http://wrigleyvillenation.com" target="_blank">The Wrigleyville Nation Podcast</a>.  </p>
<p>Pat is a Wrigleyville resident and describes what Wrigley Field and the neighborhood looks like a week before Opening Night.  Pat also talks about what your Wrigley experience may be like if you plan to attend a Cubs game this season.  </p>
<p>This is an interesting conversation because not only is Pat a Wrigleyville resident, but also a season-ticket holder and he has a strong grasp of neighborhood politics and the relationship between the Cubs and the neighborhood.  </p>
<p>As Spring Training wraps up, there isn't much up in the air as far as roster spots go, but two players and assignments that are very much in the general baseball discussion.  Where will Javier Baez and Kris Bryant start 2015.  Kris Bryant's assignment seems very clear and although Baez has not played particularly well in Spring Training, it looks like he will most likely start with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>Edwin Jackson is lost on and off the field.  That's about all that needs to be said about him.  </p>
<p>If you are in the area and would like to watch the Cubs/Cardinals Opening Night game with us at Duffy's in Galesburg, here is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/366877980171578/" target="_blank">Facebook event with the information</a>.  </p>
<p>Last week, we talked about the meet-up we will be doing at an Iowa Cubs game.  We have changed the date to June 6<sup>th</sup>.  We will be sharing more information on this event and other events this 2015 season over the next few weeks.  </p>
