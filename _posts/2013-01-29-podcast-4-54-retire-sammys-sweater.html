<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about Spring Training, Sammy Sosa and a few acquisitions.  <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130124&content_id=41133490&vkey=pr_chc&c_id=chc" target="_blank">The Cubs broadcast schedule for Spring Training</a> has been released.  Six games will be broadcast on tv and if you have an internet connection, you'll be able to listen to every game.  </p>
<p>Sammy Sosa can't/won't stay out of the spotlight and publicized his opinion that the Cubs should retire his #21.  We asked our listeners how they felt about this through a poll on <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">our Facebook page</a> and the results were 83% voting "no" and 17% voting "yes".  The three of us are in agreement that Sammy's number should not be retired and we discuss the reasons for our opinions.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have reportedly signed Scott Hairston and we discuss what this means for the outfielders at the Cubs disposal.  The Carlos Villanueva deal is official and Lendy Castillo is DFA'd to make room.  </p>
<p>We play an interview that I did with Matthew Schumacher.  Matthew has a Kickstarter campaign underway and you can support his project here - <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/matthewschumacher/stadiums-of-summer-everything-but-the-game?ref=live" target="_blank">Stadiums of Summer</a>.  In the interview, Matthew describes his project and his motivation.  We'd encourage you to go check his project out, watch his video and support a fellow life-long Cubs fan.  </p>
<p>We wrap things up with the Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flex of the Week and the Caption Contest.  </p>
