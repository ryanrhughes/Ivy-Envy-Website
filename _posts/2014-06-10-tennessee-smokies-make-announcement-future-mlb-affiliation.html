<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Smokies.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9481" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Smokies-300x175.gif" alt="Smokies" width="300" height="175" /></a>The Tennessee Smokies will make an announcement on the future of their MLB affiliation tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Tennessee has been the AA affiliate of the Cubs since 2007.  The current contract with the Cubs is set to expire at the end of this season.  </p>
<p>This could be announcing a new contract between the Cubs and Tennessee. It could also ben announcing that the affiliation will end at the end of this season.  If the Cubs were to decide to pull out of Tennessee, they could find a new affiliate in the Southern League, the Eastern League or the Texas League.  </p>
<p>The last time the Cubs moved affiliates was after the 2012 season when they moved their Low-A Midwest League affiliate from Peoria to Kane County.  </p>
<p>Because of the timing, my hunch is that a new contract will be announced tomorrow afternoon.  If you're interested in this announcement and rumors around it, <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">follow us on Twitter</a> and we will ReTweet any information we see.  </p>
