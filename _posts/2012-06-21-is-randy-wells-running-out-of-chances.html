<p>The Cubs had the unexpected opportunity to sweep the White Sox and sent Randy Wells to the mound.  It seems that anytime a pitcher is fighting for a starting spot or roster spot, I think we're going to see them at their best.  Wells was also going up against a struggling Gavin Floyd who had one win in his previous six outings, so I thought it might be an opportunity that he'd take advantage of.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was the White Sox hitters that were taking advantage of Randy Wells.  He gave up three earned runs on five hits in 3 2/3 innings pitched.  Wells is not fully stretched out and it was a given he wouldn't go deep in this spot-start.  The issue with this outing was the four free passes he handed the White Sox.  </p>
<p>Wells' struggles have been frustrating considering in 2009, he looked as if he could become a stable piece of the Cubs staff and rotation.  The 2009 season was the first that Wells spent any serious amount of time in the majors.  He started 27 games and had a 12-10 record.  He had an ERA of 3.05 and struck out 104 and walked 46.  I bring up the K/BB comparison because this year with the Cubs, Wells has struck out 11 and walked 20.  His ERA  on the season is 4.91.  </p>
<p>Many fans thought it was a slap in the face to Randy Wells when he was shipped to Iowa to start the 2012 season, but at no point has he proven that he belongs on the major league roster.  He's been given three starts in 2012 and did not win any of the three.  </p>
<p>The Cubs did not bring Wells up because he played well in Iowa, but rather to fill spots due to DL stints and poor performances.   Wells has started 6 games for the Iowa Cubs this season.  He has a 2-2 record with a 7.71 ERA.  </p>
<p>It seems that if you have a player that feels slighted and that he belongs in the majors, you would expect him to have some extra motivation to pitch well when given the opportunity.  He's not been able to come through.  I can't see Epstein and Hoyer finding value in a guy in Wells' position.  It seems they've not been impressed from the beginning and Wells hasn't done much to change their opinion.  </p>
