<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt begin wrapping up the 2013 Cubs season by looking at the performances that earned Javier Baez and Kyle Hendricks the organization's Minor League Player of the Year and Minor League Pitcher of the Year.  </p>
<p>We look at Scott Baker and Ryan Sweeney, who have come back from injury and the Cubs are probably evaluating whether or not they'd like to bring them back for the 2014 season.  </p>
<p>Starlin Castro is wrapping up his 4th MLB season and things are not looking good, either at the plate or in the field and Corey believes Castro is at a crossroads in his career.  </p>
