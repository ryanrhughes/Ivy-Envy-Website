<p>We take in our first game on this Spring Training trip and have plenty to talk about. &nbsp;We talk about the Cubs walk-off win against the Giants and describe the vibe of Spring Training games. &nbsp;We also talk about our experiences in the <a href="http://www.springtrainingexperience.com">SpringTrainingExperience.com</a> seats with autographs, foul balls, player interaction and plenty of up-and-close views.</p>
