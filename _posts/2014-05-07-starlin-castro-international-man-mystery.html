<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/castro_starlin.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/castro_starlin-300x196.jpg" alt="castro_starlin" width="300" height="196" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9893" /></a>There are days that I wonder why <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/team/player.jsp?player_id=516770">Starlin Castro</a>'s walk-up music isn't Katy Perry's <a href="http://youtu.be/xfQBTQgfN3A">hot n cold</a>.</p>
<p>Every time we think we have handle on Starlin, he slips into another persona. Confidence in important to every baseball player, but&nbsp;it seems Castro's play&nbsp;depend in particular on how he feels about himself. One day, he looks like a&nbsp;two-time all-star, the next, he looks like he just got off the bus from Double-A.&nbsp;Heck, there are even some that can't&nbsp;settle on his&nbsp;name.&nbsp;(hold the "G" please Mr. Moreland).</p>
<p>Statistically Castro is every bit the enigma his play on the field suggests. For his career, Castro is hitting just .104 on balls hit to the infield, despite the fact that he has enough speed to leg out infield hits. But, on balls hit to the outfield he is hitting a sizzling .562 with 202 extra base hits.</p>
<p>But even that outstanding number&nbsp;contains its own mystery. Of those 202 extra base hits, 41 are home runs. Home runs mean you hit a fly ball. But our boy is hitting just .208 when he hits a fly ball. So how come the big percentage?&nbsp;When Castro hits a line drive, he is hitting .689. I'll say that again, slowly. When Starlin Castro&nbsp;hits&nbsp;a line drive in his four-year career, 68.9 percent of the time, that ball lands safely, which is good. Of those 317 line drive hits in 464 at bats, he's hit all of four home runs. That is...confusing.</p>
<p>The deeper you go down the rabbit hole, the more complex Castro is statistically. He has played 636 major league games, 324 have come at Wrigley Field. Despite the fact that he has played just over half of his games at what people consider a friendly hitter's park, his home/road splits are almost identical. At home Castro is hitting .286 with 23 homers and &nbsp;131 RBI. On the road? .280 with 18 homers and 112 RBI. The most dramatic differences between home and road? At home he has 19 triples and 11 intentional walks and on the road those numbers nine and four.</p>
<p>You lost yet? Yes? Good. Me too and I'm writing this thing.</p>
<p>Breaking down Castro's numbers by month, you'll find that he performs the worst in June, a month that traditionally many players start to&nbsp;heat up. It's not just a subtle dip either. Castro hits 40 points lower in June than in any other month, but that's the month he has grounded into the fewest double plays and his walk to strikeout ratio is his second best of any month.</p>
<p>With crazy numbers like that, it's no wonder his confidence is all over the place.&nbsp;That begs the question: Does he have confidence issues because he has crazy numbers or does he have crazy numbers because he has confidence issues? That's the question that Mike Quade, Dale Sveum and Ricky Renteria and the rest of Cubs nation have been trying to answer.</p>
<p>One thing is sure though, the answer does not figure to be simple.</p>
