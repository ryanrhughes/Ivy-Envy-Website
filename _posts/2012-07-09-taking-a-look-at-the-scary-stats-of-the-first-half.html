<p>The all-star break is a perfect time to check on some first half stats. If you listen to the podcast you&rsquo;ve no doubt heard me do the "scary stat of the week". Generally it&rsquo;s bad, but occasionally good. This year&rsquo;s Cub team has offered plenty of ammunition in the search for scariness. Here&rsquo;s a run down of the scary stats from each podcast and a quick update if things changed or stayed the same.</p>
<p><strong>4-21</strong><br />
This early in the season the scary stats are a little less in depth. On the morning of April 21, Alfonso Soriano had no extra base hits in his first 48 at bats.</p>
<p>Since then Soriano has racked up 30 extra base hits with 15 doubles and 15 home runs. He showed that April was a fluke and hit 7 home runs in May and 8 in June.</p>
<p><strong>4-28</strong><br />
Cubs catchers (Soto and Clevenger at the time) were last in the leagues in stolen bases allowed with 21 in just 19 games. They cut down just 4 runners for .840 stolen base percentage. Clevenger had caught 3 out of 27, Soto 10 out of 43.</p>
<p>This is a category where things have not improved much. Poor play from the catching spot is somewhat expected when you&rsquo;ve started five different catchers in the first half. As team they&rsquo;ve now allowed 73 and caught just 18 for an .802 SBPCT, the 3<sup>rd</sup> worst in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>5-13</strong><br />
This week was the first positive scary stat. The Cubs&rsquo; top three starters, Dempster, Garza, and Samardzija had outperformed the Phillies&rsquo; Lee, Hamels and Halladay in ERA with a 2.15 combined vs 2.55 for the Phillies.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve held their ground with a combined 3.67 thanks to Dempster&rsquo;s insanely low 1.99 (2<sup>nd</sup> in baseball) vs the Phillies top three combined of 3.72</p>
<p><strong>5-19</strong><br />
We talked a lot about Anthony Rizzo tearing it up in Iowa and his numbers were good enough to keep the scary stat positive for two straight weeks. Rizzo&rsquo;s numbers in the first 39 games in Iowa: 14 HR, 39 RBI, 106 total bases, .707 slugging, .353 average. We wondered at the time where LaHair would fit if Rizzo were called up.</p>
<p>Rizzo is now playing first every day for the Cubs. His numbers in 12 games with the Cubs: .354 average, 17 hits, 4 doubles, 4 HR, 9 RBI and slugging .688. Not much fall-off there.</p>
<p><strong>5-26</strong><br />
Back to bad. Cubs were the worst team in baseball with a .333 winning percentage and on pace to be the worst team in Cubs history. The worst season(s) in Cubs history were 1962 and 1966. They finished each of those years with a .364 winning percentage. In order to finish above .364 the Cubs would have to improve to a .385 WP. To finish .500 they would have to play at .564, about as good as some of the top teams in baseball.</p>
<p>At the break they are 33-52, a .388 WP and are 7-3 in their last 10.</p>
<p><strong>6-2</strong><br />
The Cubs had just 15 save opportunities and converted only 7. 11 teams had as many saves as the Cubs had opportunities. 26 individual pitchers had 7 or more saves. At that rate the Cubs would finish the season with 48 opportunities and would only convert 22.</p>
<p>There are some positive signs in the save department. They are still last in baseball with 15 saves in 27 opportunities, but have moved above 50%. Carlos Marmol has converted 8 of 10 and his last 7.</p>
<p><strong>6-16</strong><br />
After the firing of hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo I decided to look at some offensive numbers. In 2009, the season before Rudy came to Chicago, the Cubs walked 592 times. In 2012 they dropped to 479 and 425 in 2011. OBP was .320 in 2012, .314 in 2011 and .305 on June 6.</p>
<p>Things aren&rsquo;t looking a whole lot better under James Rowson and they are still 29<sup>th</sup> in baseball with a .300 OBP. However, the offense seems to be improving and Starlin Castro has 4 of his 12 walks in the last 11 games.</p>
<p><strong>6-23</strong><br />
The Cubs were 10-27 on the road and 3-15 against LH starters for a .166 winning percentage. When those two are combined and they faced a lefty on the road they were 1-9 for .100 WP. Even at home vs righties, their best chance to win, they were still 12-13.</p>
<p>Since then, they are 5-3 against LH starters and 2-2 against lefties on the road. A huge improvement in a short time.</p>
<p><strong>6-30</strong><br />
In his first 10 starts Jeff Samardzija was 5-3 with an ERA just over 3.00 and walked only 19. Cubs were 7-3 in those 10 games. In his next five starts, Samardzija was 0-4 with an ERA over 10.00 and walked 15.</p>
<p>It looks like he&rsquo;s got his old form back and has pitched very well in his last 2 starts. He threw 7 innings in each, gave up 4 earned runs, walked 3, and struck out 15. He picked up 11 of those 15 strike outs when he dominated the Braves on July 2.</p>
