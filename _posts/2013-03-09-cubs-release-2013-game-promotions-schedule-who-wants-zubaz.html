<p>The Cubs have released information on their 2013 Promotions and Giveaways Schedule.  I will say that since the purchase of the Cubs by the Ricketts family, the giveaways have greatly improved.  In May of 2011, <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/cubs-need-to-step-up-their-game-in-promotions/" target="_blank">I wrote this post</a>, comparing the Cubs promotional items to the promo items of the Angels.  </p>
<p>While the Cubs were giving away foam #1 fingers to the first 10,000 fans, the Angels were giving away different styles of hats and backpacks.  Not only were these hats actually pretty nice (I have one from a game I went to in 2010 that is actually stylish enough to wear in public), but they gave them to every fan in the stands.  We met some family at the Angels game when they gave them away and they had run out, so they stood at the gates and took names and addresses of fans so they could be mailed to them.  </p>
<p>While the giveaways have improved, I think I could look at this bobblehead face all day and never guess it was Darwin Barney.  </p>

<p>You can find the entire list of <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/schedule/promotions.jsp?c_id=chc&y=2013" target="_blank">Cubs 2013 promo and giveaway dates here.</a></p>
<p>The Cubs have also released information on their Special Events calendar.  I'm really happy to see that the Cubs and <a href="http://twitter.com/cubs" target="_blank">@Cubs</a> are bringing back Social Media Night.  Last year, they had two Social Media Nights and I was able to attend one of them.  This year, there's one event and it's on August 21st vs. the Nationals.  </p>
<p>There is one special event that is sure to catch your eye, and how could it not?  Monday, September 23rd vs. the Pirates is Zubazpalooza 2013.  </p>
<p><center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/zubaz.jpg"><img data-id="8279"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/zubaz-300x300.jpg" alt="Cubs Zubaz" width="300" height="300" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8279" /></a></center></p>
<p>That's right, if you purchase the $27 tickets for Zubazpalooza, you will not only get a bleacher seat to see the Cubs square off against the Pirates, but you'll get a pair of Cubs Zubaz pants.  </p>
<p>Yeah, it's a lame event, but you can't really go wrong with promo items.  I mean, it's not like totally screwing up a marketing campaign.  If you missed it earlier in the week, the Cubs have decided "Committed" would be a good marketing motto.  Handing out Zubaz at every home game would be a better idea than "Committed".  </p>
<p>I know one person that was thrilled about the announcement of Zubaz night at Wrigley...a young Prince Fielder.</p>
