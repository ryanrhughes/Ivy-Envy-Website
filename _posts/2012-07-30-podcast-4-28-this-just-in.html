<p>I believe this episode is the first time we've experienced a Cubs player traded during a recording, and there appeared to be two players traded.  We start off by talking about what we witnessed from Javier Baez in Peoria on Sunday.  We comment on the plate-mob celebration after Anthony Rizzo's walk-off home run against the Cardinals and our feelings on these types of celebrations.</p>
<p>Ryan Dempster rejects a trade to the Braves and we talk about this situation and the impact that move had on the Cubs hopes of getting some talent in return.  We talk about a few other players that could (and are) traded.  </p>
<p>Then, we look at some questions from listeners.  We discuss the idea of the Cubs tanking the season.  Michael from Galesburg brings up Mark Prior and we re-live that whole situation.  DeRose gives us a whole show's-worth of material involving Almora, Soler, Dempster, Zach Lee, Soto, the #10 in the outfield grass and Cubs hats and how they are designed and styled.</p>
<p>Kurt gives us his scary stat of the week and we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  Then things get interesting with some moves and we bail so we can pay attention to the game.  </p>
