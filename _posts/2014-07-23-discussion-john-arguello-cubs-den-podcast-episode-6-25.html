<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/John-Arguello.jpeg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/John-Arguello-300x300.jpeg" alt="John Arguello" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10267" /></a>We have another bonus episode for you this week.  John Arguello from <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-den" target="_blank">Cubs Den</a> pops in to discuss a variety of Cubs baseball topics.  </p>
<p>I don't think you can have a Cubs discussion without talking about prospects and the majority of this discussion involves prospects.  John discusses the timelines the Cubs have with Kris Bryant and Jorge Soler.  While on the topic of Soler, you might be surprised with what John has to say when comparing Soler and Javier Baez.  </p>
<p>Pitching comes up and we spend some time on Jen-Ho Tseng, the pitcher that John ranks highest in his list of Cubs prospects.  He also talks about prospects that he thinks are flying under the radar with all of the attention on the big names.  </p>
<p>We do spend some time talking about the big league team.  It appears that Arismendy Alcantara may be sticking with the Cubs.  We also discuss the struggles that Mike Olt and Junior Lake are experiencing. With the trade deadline just about a week away, John guesses as to what he thinks the Cubs may (or may not) do.  </p>
