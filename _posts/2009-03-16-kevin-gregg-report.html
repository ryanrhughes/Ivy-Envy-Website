<p>It's high time we had a preseason report on the G-R-E-double-G.&nbsp; Even though he's not "mobbin'" with Dre, he is having a good spring.&nbsp; Our new favorite bespectacled Cub has five scoreless innings pitched, giving up only two hits and striking out five.&nbsp; He has made a strong case for the closer spot, and in fact, he has expressed a strong desire to pitch in that role for the Cubs.</p>
<p>Regarding the closer role, Carrie Muskat quoted Gregg as saying, ""I want it . . . I want to close. I have no qualms about saying that."&nbsp; It is good to have some new guys that want the ball like Gregg and Heilman, but will they be happy and effective if they do not get to pitch in the role they desire?&nbsp; There is no reason why Marmol shouldn't still be the Cubs' closer on opening day, despite his final WBC appearance.&nbsp; However, it is nice to know that the Cubs have some very capable players who can step in if Marmol and Marshall struggle.</p>
<p>The only trouble with Gregg, other than his two first names, is his affinity for <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/images/2009/03/14/lXIBjYkF.jpg" target="_blank">Glamour Shots</a>.&nbsp; Also, if you're a fan of PSAs (as I am), check out Gregg's--</p>

<p>Nicely done, sir.&nbsp; Now please give yourself a damn surname!</p>
