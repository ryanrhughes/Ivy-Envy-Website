<p>In 2011, we saw the worst of Carlos Marmol.  Despite his 34 saves, the un-touchable Marmol was exposed as very hittable.  On top of that, his control was as poor as it's always been.  It's been easy to look past his lack of control, especially when he enters games because of his ability to lock it down and strike out the side.  We saw that lock-down strikeout ability diminish greatly in 2011.  </p>
<p>While his hits per nine innings raised from 4.6 to 6.6, his strikeouts per nine innings went from 16 (granted, a ridiculous number) to 12.  A 35% increase in hits and a 25% decrease in strikeouts means more base runners, which means more runs, which leads to blown saves when looking at a closer.  And that's what the result was with Carlos Marmol in 2011.  Of his 22 career blown saves, 10 of them came in 2011.  </p>
<p>Carlos Marmol was one of the bigger question marks heading into 2012.  Could he get back on track and capture some of that 2010 magic?  Heading into Spring Training, the Cubs talked a lot about this cut fastball that Marmol was trying to pitch.  <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/sports/baseball/cubs/10768221-573/cubs-have-solution-for-carlos-marmol.html" target="_blank">According to Marmol</a>, "I threw it a little bit, and it didn't work for me.  I got a little lost.  My slider got a little lost because I worked on that."  New Cubs manager, Dale Sveum spoke about this pitch from his perspective as the Brewers' hitting coach, "We were thinking 'What's he doing?  Is that a bad slider?"  So the plan is for Marmol to lose the cut fast ball, go back to his bread and butter - sliders and a fastball or two sprinkled in.     </p>
<p>In his 2012 Spring Training debut, Marmol pitched the 3rd inning of the March 4th game vs. the A's.  He retired the A's 1-2-3 and registered a strikeout.  Since then, it's been ugly.  In the March 8th game vs. the Mariners, Marmol earned a blown save and a loss in his 2/3 innings of performance.  He gave up four runs on four hits, hit a batter and served up a home run.  Things didn't get any better in today's game as Marmol got his 2nd blown save in 2 games.  Marmol gave up three runs on two hits, walking two and hitting a batter.  </p>
<p>Well, Marmol has either not adjusted, or the Cubs are in big trouble with the closer that is slated to earn $7 million this year and almost $10 million in 2013.  I have not seen Marmol pitch, but I am hoping that Chris Bosio and the rest of the Cubs coaching staff has Marmol working on something, not worrying about the result, but I doubt that is the case.  </p>
<p>Wins will be quite valuable in 2012 for this club.  I don't think the Cubs will be real eager to head into the 9th with a lead and let their closer hand the game over to the opposing team.  In the short-term, the answer is to hand the closer spot over to Kerry Wood.  </p>
<p>But the larger issue is if Marmol is unable to figure this out, then the Cubs are stuck with another over-paid, and probably un-movable piece for the next couple of years.  When he is on, Carlos Marmol is one of the most exciting players to put on a Cubs uniform in my lifetime.  Spring Training exists for players to shake off the cobwebs and work with new coaching staffs.  Let's all hope that when Opening Day rolls around, the old Marmol is back and we see him return to making batters look like fools.  </p>
