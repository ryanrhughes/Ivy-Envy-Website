<p><strong>Cubs entered the series 3-3 and ended 4-5.<br />
</strong><strong>Brewers entered the series 3-4 and ended 5-5.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_08_chnmlb_milmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap" target="_blank">Friday, April 8</a></strong><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_08_chnmlb_milmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap" target="_blank"><br />
</a>Cubs 7<br />
Brewers 4</p>
<p>WP&ndash;Carlos Zambrano (1-0)<br />
LP&ndash;Randy Wolf (0-2)<br />
SV&ndash;Carlos Marmol (3)</p>
<p>The Cubs started a long 9-game road trip in Milwaukee and had to be confident starting the series with Zambrano as he was 10-5 at Miller Park going in to Friday's game. Z looked good, but gave up Prince Fielder's first home run of the season and 100th of his career in the second. After that, Z settled in nicely and only gave up two more runs and finished strong in the 6th with an 8 pitch inning.</p>
<p>The highlight of the game was the offense of Jeff Baker who went 4-5 with 4 RBI. Baker crushed a 3 run home run in the 4th after Geovany Soto picked up his first home run of the year just four batters before. Baker hits left handed pitching well and it's likely that we'll continue to see him starting when lefties take the mound.</p>
<p>After Zambrano's departure the Marshall, Wood, Marmol 7-8-9 combo worked to perfection and Marmol picked up his third save in his usual erratic way.</p>

</a>Cubs 0<br />
Brewers 6</p>
<p>WP&ndash;Chris Narveson (1-0)<br />
LP&ndash;Matt Garza (0-1)</p>
<p>After a good win on Friday the Cubs just couldn't get the offense going on Saturday. Chris Narveson threw 7 strong innings and only gave up 6 hits and no runs to the Cubs. The Cubs had their chances but Carlos Pena struck out three times in the game, all with runners on base.</p>
<p>The Brewers lineup showed their muscle led by Ryan Braun and Prince Fielder and put up 5 runs on Matt Garza. Braun ended the day 2-4 with three runs and an RBI and Fielder ended 3-4 (all doubles) with 4 RBI.</p>

</a>Cubs 5<br />
Brewers 6</p>
<p>WP&ndash;Kameron Loe (1-0)<br />
LP&ndash;Kerry Wood (0-1)<br />
SV&ndash;John Axford (3)</p>
<p>After Saturday's throw away game, the Cubs were in position to take the series with a good performance on Sunday. This was our first look at call-up Casey Coleman who pitched well, going 5 innings and only giving up four runs to this potent offense. The Cubs started strong offensively, scoring in each of the first three innings, but the Braun/Fielder show wouldn't let the Cubs sneak away and each hit two run homers to tie the game. The Cubs would score again in the 7th to take the lead after three scoreless innings. Their inability to score more than one run in a bases-loaded one out situation would haunt them in the 8th when Kerry Wood gave up a game winning, two run homer to Casey McGehee. Game three of the series could have easily ended differently. It's easy to blame Wood, but this loss is squarely on the offense.</p>
<p><strong>They are who we thought they were<br />
</strong>After an 0-4 start the Brewers have now won 5 of 6. Their offense is stacked, but their defense is mediocre at best. To beat the Brewers the Cubs will have to score runs and take advantage of what the Brewers give up on fielding mistakes. Even with good pitching the Brewers will put up huge offensive numbers.</p>
<p><strong>RISP<br />
</strong>Game 1, 2-8, Game 2, 0-5, Game 3, 2-17. The Cubs have a good offense and the young guys are doing their job getting on base. The big hitters need to step up and get them home. 4-30 is not good enough vs. a team like the Brewers.</p>
<p><strong>Do me a favor, don't panic...yet<br />
</strong>It's April!</p>
