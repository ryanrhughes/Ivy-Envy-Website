<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt return to review the last few weeks in Cubs baseball.  We start off by talking about the signing of Albert Almora and the other first 20 players drafted by the Cubs in the 2012 draft.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have put together a nice little run since Anthony Rizzo was called up.  We consider his impact on the team, how much of this success he is responsible for, and explore the other factors.  </p>
<p>Then we go through many topic suggestions and questions from listeners.  Many of them involve Ryan Dempster and others that could be traded and some excitement about how well the team is playing right now.  </p>
<p>After the break, we introduce a new (and possibly reoccurring) segment, <strong><u>Disparaging Diatribes From a Disgruntled ex-Sportswriter</strong></u> with Matt Veto.  Kurt gives Ryan Dempster a potential send-off with a Scary Stat of the Week.  Then, we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
<p>We will be back with a live video broadcast next week at 10am Central.  </p>
