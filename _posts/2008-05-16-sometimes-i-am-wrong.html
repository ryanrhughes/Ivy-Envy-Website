excerpt: I have been fairly outspoken about certain Cubs players.&nbsp; I appreciate
  everything they do for the club, and I know they are great for the team, but I don't
  care for Aramis Ramirez and Alfonso Soriano.&nbsp; These two are the biggest culprits
  of guys that love to admire any ball they hit.&nbsp; However, usually that ball
  leaves the yard.

<p>I have been fairly outspoken about certain Cubs players.&nbsp; I appreciate everything they do for the club, and I know they are great for the team, but I don't care for Aramis Ramirez and Alfonso Soriano.&nbsp; These two are the biggest culprits of guys that love to admire any ball they hit.&nbsp; However, usually that ball leaves the yard.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-76"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course I cheer like a fool, but I do it through gritted teeth as I watch them stand and watch the ball fly.&nbsp; You both have seen homeruns before.&nbsp; You know what a homerun looks like.&nbsp; I promise it will eventually land...they always do.&nbsp; Put your head down and run the bases.&nbsp; This is all throughout baseball and in no way limited to these two guys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soriano was off to an awful start.&nbsp; Batting average under .200 and a stupid injury that was most likely caused by another habit of his that I will always see as being cocky.&nbsp; But now he has just hit a lead-off homerun in three out of four games.&nbsp; He's on fire at the plate.&nbsp; This team was putting up silly numbers without him and I can only imagine how busy that scoreboard worker will be at Wrigley with him hitting like this.&nbsp; Of course, I have followed the Cubs long enough to know that since he has heated up, chances are the rest of the team will cool down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm wrong about players.&nbsp; And if this is what happens when I'm wrong, I'll take some more of it.&nbsp; I have finally forced myself to admit that Ramirez is way better in the field than I ever gave him credit for and although his swings drive me nuts, he does have a really good eye at the plate.&nbsp; I didn't think Soriano would amount to anything after this April and half of May, but I will now remember to not count him out.&nbsp; I'll still get annoyed by Ramirez swinging for the fences and hitting foul-out and infield pop flies that go up about 500 feet.&nbsp; I will still be frustrated with Soriano taking the first pitch and swinging at the send, regardless of their locations 9 out of every 10 at bats.&nbsp; It's hard for me to admit, but I'm glad these guys are on the north side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I finish writing this entry, Alfonso Soriano just hit his second HR of the day.&nbsp; 2-2 with 2 HR and 4 RBI's.&nbsp; God I love being wrong!</p>
