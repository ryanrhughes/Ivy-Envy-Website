<div>Since Ivy Envy is a collaborative effort, you might read a few different opinions here on the site in the next week or so about Mike Quade being named the Cubs manager. </div></strong></center></p>
<p><center><img alt="" src="http://www.lethbridgeherald.com/cp/images/NY160-823_2010_162052_low.jpg" title="Quade" class="aligncenter" width="300" height="240" /> </center><br />
<br></p>
<div>I think many Cubs fans were a little surprised today when Mike Quade was named the manager of the team.&nbsp; After I heard the news this morning, I texted my wife &ldquo;Quade is the new manager.&rdquo;&nbsp; She responded &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t Sandberg apply?&rdquo;&nbsp; I found it pretty humorous, but after I thought about it, she (like most Cubs fans) figured it was a sure-thing that Sandberg would be given the job.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>Let me start by saying that I didn&rsquo;t have a strong opinion (despite our site&rsquo;s tag-line...Strong Opinions and Marginal Analysis of the Chicago Cubs) on the whole Quade/Sandberg debate.&nbsp; I honestly don&rsquo;t know enough about either of them as managers.&nbsp; Both have a proven track record in the minor league management experience.&nbsp; Sandberg has been on the fast-track through the Cubs minor league system, working his way through Peoria, Tennessee and Iowa in 4 years.&nbsp; This last season in Iowa, he was named the PCL Manager of the Year.&nbsp; Quade has 17 years of minor league managing experience.&nbsp; He was Manager of the Year twice and won the AAA World Series in 1999.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>While management experience in the minor leagues is valuable, I can&rsquo;t help but think that managing in the minor leagues is different than managing in MLB.&nbsp; I suppose this is where Quade's 3 years of MLB coaching experience could come into play. I've heard many people speculate that Sandberg needs to get some experience with a big league club before he takes over as a manager.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>But honestly, I don't think either Quade or Sandberg will be the reason the Cubs win or lose.&nbsp; Yes, Quade was "successful" after being named interim manager.&nbsp; However, he had a full 40-man roster to work with, which means you don't need to worry about wearing out your bullpen.&nbsp; He took over the Cubs when they were well out of the playoff race and there was very little pressure on the Cubs to win.&nbsp; I wouldn't go so far as to say that the club had been gutted, but they had already traded away a portion of the big-name talent.&nbsp; The expectations were low and the Cubs were able to play loose and the role of the spoilers.  Personally, I believe that Quade's late-season success says more about Piniella's management than anything.&nbsp; I backed Piniella throughout the season, but I'm starting to think that Piniella was as big of a problem as anyone on the roster or in the front office.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>Quade is the anti-Piniella, and you will find these types of hirings all of the time in sports.&nbsp; Teams have the tendency to hire the opposite of the manager the person would be replacing.&nbsp; In football, if you have a coach that is offensive-minded and the team put up a lot of points, but had a bad defense and couldn't stop anyone, you can pretty much guarantee that the next guy will be a defense-minded coach.&nbsp; Dusty Baker was, for the most part, reserved.&nbsp; He was also notorious for having "his guys".&nbsp; I don't need to name them, you know who they were.&nbsp; So who did they replace him with?&nbsp; Lou Piniella, a hot-head who would hold players accountable and frankly didn't give a shit what people thought of him.&nbsp; While Sandberg was a very reserved player, his managerial style is quite the opposite.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>So who did the Cubs hire?&nbsp; The anti-Piniella that, during his stint as the interim manager, was on the field coaching players, something we didn't see Piniella doing.&nbsp; Quade is a quiet and reserved guy that is comfortable and honest with the media.&nbsp; A typical Piniella press conference was filled with lots of stuttering and the avoidance of questions.&nbsp; I have seen a few press conferences by Quade and they're actually interesting!&nbsp; He is honest.&nbsp; He answers questions immediately and doesn't work his way around them.&nbsp; It's almost like you're getting the real story.&nbsp; It is refreshing.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>So I don't know where this leaves Sandberg.&nbsp; All indications are that he's probably bitter.&nbsp; And that's fine, he wasn't guaranteed this job.&nbsp; Quade put in 17 years in the minors and a few years with the Cubs, why would Sandberg feel he's more qualified as a manager?&nbsp; In all reality, the Cubs are doing Sandberg a favor by not hiring him to manage this mess that Hendry has created.&nbsp; That would be setting him up for failure.&nbsp; Fans would expect him to magically right this ship.&nbsp; The expectations and pressure would be ridiculous.&nbsp; Sandberg will probably, at some point in the near future, end up managing another team.&nbsp; A franchise better suited for a first-time manager.&nbsp; And perhaps we will see Sandberg's return when Quade is finished.&nbsp; Then again, this is what I thought when the Marlins hired Girardi and look how that's turned out.</div><br />
<br></p>
<div>I don't know what this means for Sandberg.&nbsp; Will he be a bench coach?&nbsp; Will he return to Iowa?&nbsp; Will he give a one-fingered salute to Jim Hendry and head to Toronto?&nbsp; I would assume we'll know in the next week.&nbsp; Mike Quade is the manager of the Cubs and seeing where this team is, I wouldn't say that's a bad thing to have him at the helm.&nbsp; I am looking forward to someone other than Lou Piniella leading this team for the next three years.</div><br />
