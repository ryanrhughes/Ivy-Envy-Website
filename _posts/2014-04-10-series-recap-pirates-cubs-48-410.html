  content: As frustrating as this seasons been so far only the 1st game of the philly
    series has been a blow out. Sure id like to have won more (espec any of the four
    1 run games) but we are competing and although losing sucks you can still see
    the improvements this team is making. Now just need better relief pitching

Tuesday: (L) Pirates 8 Cubs 7<br />
Wednesday: (W) Cubs 7 Pirates 5<br />
Thursday: (L) Pirates 5 Cubs 4</p>
<p>Cubs Record: 3-6</p>
<p><u><strong>The Good</u></strong><br />
After struggling in 2013, <strong>Anthony Rizzo</strong> has started 2014 off strong and he had a stellar series against the Pirates.  In the three games, Rizzo went 6-8 with two doubles. Rizzo is now hiting .371/.463/.514 on the season.   </p>
<p>Speaking of having a rough season in 2013, <strong>Starlin Castro</strong> was off to a bit of a slow start.  I think we can blame it on the fact that he didn't get much game-action in Spring Training because of an injury.  In this series, Castro went 7-13 with 2 HR and 5 RBIs.  He has raised his batting numbers significantly - .342/.359/.525.</p>
<p>Holy <strong>Emilio Bonifacio</strong>!  He's reached base safely in each of the first 9 games of the season.  It's been a lot of fun watching a real lead-off hitter.  Bonifacio went 5-14 (.357) in the series and is hitting .452 on the season and has 7 stolen bases.  </p>
<p><strong>Jason Hammel</strong> pitched well (besides three solo HRs) on Wednesday.  He went 7 innings and struck out six.  The three solo home runs were the only three hits he gave up in the game.  Hammel is now 2-0 with a 2.63 ERA.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Bad</u></strong><br />
I keep thinking that at some point, <strong>Edwin Jackson</strong>'s luck will change, but it just never seems to happen.  Jackson had another rough game on Tuesday, going 4 2/3 innings and surrendering 6 runs on 9 hits.  He registered 4 strikeouts, but also walked 4.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Ugly</u></strong><br />
While the Cubs signed Jose Veras to close this season, the long-term closer appears to be <strong>Pedro Strop</strong>.  And boy, he sure looks like a Cubs closer.  In this series, he pitched 1 1/3 innings and gave up 3 runs, two of which were solo HRs.  He also walked two.  With Strop showing no reliability out of the bullpen right now, it's probably a good thing that the Cubs brought in Veras...assuming he can find the strike zone.  </p>
<p>You want ugly?  How about the 7<sup>th</sup> inning of today's game?  <strong>Brian Schlitter, James Russell</strong>.  Ricky went to the bullpen with the Cubs up 4-0 after a great Travis Wood outing and by the end of the inning, Schlitter and Russell had both given up home runs and the Cubs were down 5-4 and ultimately lost a game they should have won.  Ugly.  </p>
