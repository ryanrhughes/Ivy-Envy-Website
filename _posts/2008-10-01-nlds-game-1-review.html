<p>My God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't even know where to begin.&nbsp; I became increasingly nervous about this game throughout the day.&nbsp; The last few days have been exciting.&nbsp; A successful regular season behind us and nothing but potential bliss ahead.&nbsp; I listened to WSCR 670AM out of Chicago and within hours had chiseled down my fingernails and had a heavy feeling in my stomach.&nbsp; Celebrating the regular season was over and the post season was about to begin.&nbsp; Suddenly to me, the Cubs pitching didn't look quite so great.&nbsp; I was hearing all of these ridiculous stats about Derek Lowe, Manny Ramirez and the Dodgers in their last 50 or so games.&nbsp; Wait, this isn't the team in the playoffs with the worst record.&nbsp; This is a team that has put something together and surged.&nbsp; They are hot and everyone knows those teams are the dangerous ones in the playoffs.</p>
<p>So we had an Ivy Envy and friends gathering at the Backyard Pub and Grill.&nbsp; I think we ended up with 30 or so people coming over.&nbsp; We were pleased to host Dispatch/Argus Cubs Blogger Matt Veto.  Check out his blog, <a href="http://www.qconline.com/bloggers/vetopower/">Veto Power</a>.  It was a good time but <a id="more"></a><a id="more-250"></a>we didn't have much to cheer for.&nbsp; It felt a lot like watching the Cubs in the playoffs last year...except Aramis Ramirez actually got a base hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I don't know.&nbsp; This can't be it.&nbsp; We needed Game 1 though.&nbsp; For crying out loud, Dempster doesn't lose at home.&nbsp; The Cubs don't lose at home.&nbsp; I'm feeling confident about tomorrow night's game, though.&nbsp; I am the Eeyore Cubs fan.&nbsp; The pessimistic guy waiting for the other shoe to drop.&nbsp; But I have faith in Zambrano in big games.&nbsp; I know a lot of people are nervous about Zambrano on the hill after his last few starts.&nbsp; The crowd was never a factor tonight and if there is anyone that can bring the crowd into a game, it's Zambrano.&nbsp; I just can't see him allowing himself to lose in the playoffs.&nbsp; He will hold it together.&nbsp; It wouldn't surprise me if he doesn't play the role of the offensive spark, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I'm wrong...it's over.</p>
