<p>Andy and Corey hold down the fort while Kurt is out sick.  We start things off by welcoming Matt Veto back on the podcast.  We reminisce on the beginnings of Ivy Envy and our time of podcasting during the worst stretch in the history of the Chicago Cubs.  Veto recently participated in Randy Hundley's Cubs Fantasy Camp and shared his experiences with us.  </p>

<p>Now that the pitchers and catchers, as well as many of the position players are reporting to Mesa, we have news to discuss.  On the first day of camp, we learned that Jake Arrieta may not be ready to start the season.  We look at this situation and speculate who may fill in his spot as the #4 starter.  </p>
<p>Rick Renteria named the Cubs closer for the start of the season.  Newly acquired Jose Veras will fill this role and we talk about what this means for Pedro Strop and how we see this situation playing out.  The Cubs signed infielder/outfielder Emilio Bonafacio, to provide some speed, versatility and perhaps an alternative for Darwin Barney if the Gold Glove 2nd baseman can't get on base.  </p>
<p>We read a few internet muscle flexes and get through about 50 captions for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
