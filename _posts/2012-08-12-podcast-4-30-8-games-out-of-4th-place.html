<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Jeremy muster up the strength to talk about the Cubs after their 1-10 start in the month of August.  We discuss the appealing aspects of the team and what is keeping us engaged.  Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters have been with the Cubs for a full week and we discuss their start with the club.  </p>
<p>We then look at some of the more notable names in the Cubs minor league system.  We comment on Jorge Soler with Peoria, Javier Baez with Daytona and Dan Vogelbach with the Cubs Arizona Rookie League team.  </p>
<p>We comment on the listener submitted topics and questions.  Kurt gives us his scary stat of the week, which is a previous scary stat that has returned as a possible historic low-point.  Then, we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
