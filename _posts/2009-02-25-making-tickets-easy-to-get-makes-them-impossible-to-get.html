  content: "You know, the same thing happened with me when I tried to buy tickets
    for the NLCS that the Cubs did not advance to in 2007.  I got to the captcha thing
    and then it froze up and kicked me out.  I went from elation to depression in
    seconds.  Then the Cubs got beat by the Diamondbacks and I realized that I was
    probably saved a big headache by not having to be reimbursed.\r\n\r\nI don't play
    to go to Wrigley this year.  I just don't feel like messing with driving up there,
    parking, etc.  I went up last year and it just cost me way too much money.  For
    the price of going up for one game, I can buy the MLB Extra Innings package and
    basically watch any game of any team for the entire season.\r\n\r\nI am considering
    going to a game at Miller Park this summer, though.  I will be catching at least
    one Angels game and perhaps a Diamondbacks game this summer, too."

<p>Spring training is about to start. By the time I'm done writing this the first pitch will have been thrown. I've been anxiously awaiting hearing Pat and Ron make up nicknames for the single A pitchers that start making&nbsp;appearances&nbsp;around the 5th inning. The&nbsp;anticipation&nbsp;of the last couple weeks made me think, "wouldn't it be nice to go to a game this year?"</p>
<p>I've made attempts to order tickets online on the first day of sale in past seasons. All have resulted in no tickets. Most people would think that I would have learned my lesson, but I'm a Cubs fan, I don't learn lessons from failure.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-271"></a>The morning of February 25 I logged in to my MLB.com account and hopped in the&nbsp;queue&nbsp;at 9:45 a.m. They started accepting people at 9:30 and tickets went on sale at 10. I didn't expect to get in very quickly so I just went about my day. Around noon I started to wonder if I was going to make it, but figured it's just a browser window and not too much effort to just keep waiting. I almost closed it on several occasions. When I returned to my computer after my 4 p.m. bathroom run I WAS IN! By that time all Saturday and most Sunday games were unavailable. Almost all Cardinals games were gone. I was left with the Marlins on a Sunday afternoon. What the hell. I'll give it a shot. Give me 4 please. The cheapest seats you have. <em>You have exceeded the number of tickets available in that section.</em> Different section? <em>NO.</em> How about an October game against the Diamondbacks? <em>Sure, we have those. Enter the blurry code written below. Incorrect, try again. The system is experiencing a large demand, please try again or choose a different game.</em> Try again. <em>Same message.</em> I give up.</p>
<p>To be honest my experience wasn't any different than I expected it to be. I didn't think I was going to land Cards or Brewers game tickets on a Saturday in July. So what's my point? There are too many Cubs fans. Some of you need to find a new team. Hey, the Rays had a solid season last year and they probably have tons of fan spots available. Ok, not really, but making tickets so&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;to millions of fans makes them&nbsp;inaccessible&nbsp;for millions of fans. Last year the Cubs were seventh in attendance at 3.3 million. That means only a small fraction of us get to actually go to a game and most of those people will have paid well over face value to do so.&nbsp;There are plenty of unwanted tickets out there.&nbsp;On ebay there are over 4,500 auctions for Cubs tickets. StubHub has tickets to nearly every game all well above face value. The Saturday July 11 game against the Cards. Cheapest tickets are $65 plus fees.</p>
<p>Some would argue that it's a simple supply and demand issue and I would agree to some extent. So we either need to trade some fans to the Rays (maybe that one guy in the bleachers, you know who I'm talking about) or the Cubs need to make these things harder to get. They'll still sell out. They have nothing to worry about there. Just enact a series of tests both physical and mental. "Who's your favorite Cub?" If your answer starts with "That guy..." you're out. "How long ago did you buy that Cubs shirt?" If within the last two days...banned for life. If this game attendance is in any way associated with a reunion shopping trip with the girls, or guys for that matter, no tickets. I haven't thought of any non-sexist physical tests yet, but I'm open to suggestions.</p>
<p>Spring training has begun. Opening day is just 40 days out.</p>
