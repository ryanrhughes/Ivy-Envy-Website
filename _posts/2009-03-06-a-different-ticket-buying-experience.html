  content: "I really do think it's supply and demand. There are just too many Cubs
    fans and people who want to \"hang out\" at games. Cubs fans are so crazed for
    tickets they even helped the Brewers break a record for tickets sold. The Brewers
    play the Cubs in their home opener and I bet the crowd will be almost 50/50.\r\nhttp://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/wire/chi-ap-wi-brewerstickets,0,4455803.story"

<p>This morning at 8:55am, I logged into my MLB.com account and did something that will probably make most of you want to yank my status as a card-carrying Cubs fan.&nbsp; I sat in the virtual waiting room to get tickets for the St. Louis Cardinals.&nbsp; I work with a Cardinals fan that was unsure of his technology skills and he asked for some assistance in buying tickets.</p>
<p>Kurt shared his story about trying to buy tickets and it's also something that we touched on in Episode #1 of the Ivy Envy podcast.&nbsp; So I'd like to share quite a different story than what Kurt experienced.&nbsp; I entered the virtual waiting room at 8:55am.&nbsp; By 9:10am, we had completed the transaction and the printer was churning out the receipt.</p>
<p>I don't know what this means.&nbsp; So I'll turn it over to you.&nbsp; What's your explanation of this?&nbsp; Is it that the Cubs offer a superior product? Are the Cubs simply the popular thing to do?&nbsp; Perhaps there are fewer ticket brokers hogging up tickets in St. Louis.&nbsp; As a fan coming from the "underdog" side of things, I don't know how I feel about it.&nbsp; I can only assume that Cubs fans older than myself and remember the empty stands and ultra-cheap tickets would be more conflicted about this.</p>
<p>What's your take?</p>
