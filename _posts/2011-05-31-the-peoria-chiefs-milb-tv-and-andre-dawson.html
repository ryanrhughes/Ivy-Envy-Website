  content: As far as an entire channel devoted to one sport, MLB-TV and the NFL Network
    get it right.  Basketball and hockey it just doesn't work because there's a certain
    redundancy to those sports that doesn't warrant around the clock coverage.

<p>If you haven't heard <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=5316">our latest podcast</a>, we have a nice conversation Nathan Baliva, the play-by-play voice for the Peoria Chiefs.  Nathan does a good job of promoting the Chiefs and you can tell&nbsp;it is more than a job for Nathan, he possesses a real love for the club.</p>
<p>In the interview, Nathan tells you why O'Brien Field is one of the best minor league ballparks in the Midwest.  I don't know of any other ballpark around these parts in which you can sit under a palm tree.  O'Brien isn't the only draw to these games.  The Chiefs are currently in 2nd place in the Western Division of the Midwest League and have a healthy 18-8 record at home.</p>
<p>Now that the weather is starting to warm up and if you're thinking about catching a Chiefs game, you might want to consider the Saturday, June 11th game.  Hall-of-Famer, Andre Dawson, will be at the game to throw out the first pitch and sign autographs.  It's a great opportunity to see the Chiefs and a Cubs legend.</p>
<p>Also, MiLB.tv is a pretty decent investment if you're into Minor League Baseball.  If you're a smart consumer, you can get the entire season for about $10.  It's mainly Triple-A games, so you're able to see every game of the Iowa Cubs.  However, according to the Peoria Chiefs website, all three games of this weekend's series with the Great Lakes Loons (Dodgers) will be broadcast on MiLB.tv.  So check out the broadcasts this weekend and get to Peoria next Saturday to shake hands with the Hawk.</p>
