<p>When we spoke about the Matt Garza trade on this <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3547" target="_blank">last podcast</a>, we kind of dismissed Fernando Perez.&nbsp; I happened across a few videos today that thrust Perez to the top of my "Most Liked Cubs" list.&nbsp; The first video is creativity on the field that would excite any fan and would be talked about on blogs and in bars for years.</p>

The Cubs have been known for having some characters on the team.&nbsp; While I was not a huge fan of Ryan Theriot on the field, I did appreciate <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3452" target="_blank">Theriot's sense of humor</a>.&nbsp; Based on this video, I believe Fernando Perez and Ryan Dempster will have some fun with eachother if Perez isn't pushed off the roster by Reed Johnson.&nbsp; Here is a video of Perez discussing the plight of the MLB minimum salary player.</p>
