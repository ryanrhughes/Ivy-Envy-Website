  content: Being from Chicago and now living in San Antonio I only listen to Cubs
    Games via MLB At Bat.  I listen to it on my laptop and Pipe it in to a speakers
    in the Yard, Garage or Back porch.  It really has an old time feel vs watching
    it on Television.

<p>I recently decided that I will not be purchasing the MLB Extra Innings package.&nbsp; Last year, I didn't use it nearly as much as I expected that I would.&nbsp; A few times, we'd be out in the backyard on the weekend and a game from the NL or AL Central would finish and we would flip over and watch a west coast game, but we didn't do it often enough to justify $200 for the package.</p>
<p>I was at Twenty Sports Grille (proud sponsor of Ivy Envy) a few weeks ago and a guy informed me of the<a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mobile/"> MLB At-Bat application</a> for iPhone, Blackberry and Android.&nbsp; The details for 2010 have not been released, but this app cost only $10 last year and it includes Pitch-by-Pitch, video highlights, video of 1 or 2 live games per day, as well as the home and away radio feeds for every game (no blackouts).&nbsp; This seems like an adequate and affordable replacement for me.</p>
<p>But imagining laying in bed listening to the radio broadcast of west coast games really takes me back to my childhood.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="radio" src="http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/site_furniture/2008/04/16/kidwradio460.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276" /></p>
<p>This idea makes me feel like an old-timer.&nbsp; I'm only 32, but growing up, my family didn't have cable and I relied on the radio for my baseball fix.&nbsp; Sadly, living in central Illinois, this fix was taken care of by the St. Louis Cardinals, via Jack Buck and Mike Shannon.&nbsp; Being a Cubs fan, I fell asleep every summer night, rooting for whoever the Cardinals were playing.</p>
<p>But the game is different on the radio.&nbsp; Obviously, the announcers are relied upon to paint a visual picture of the game for the listeners.&nbsp; But it's more than that.&nbsp; There is a cadence to calling a game on the radio.&nbsp; Ron Santo doesn't quite have this cadence down yet.</p>
<p>Baseball seems more pure to me on the radio.&nbsp; I can't see what actually happened during a play.&nbsp; I am trusting the call of the announcer.&nbsp; On television, I can see Soriano's gaffes in the field clearly.&nbsp; I can form my own opinion of the play of each person on the field.&nbsp; On the radio, I only know what the guy in the booth wants me to know.&nbsp; I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but it's quite the opposite.&nbsp; There is an element of innocence to listening to the game.&nbsp; You listen for the love of the game.&nbsp; I don't listen to a game on the radio ready to second-guess and question every ball and strike call.&nbsp; I don't over-analyze the route an outfielder takes to the ball.&nbsp; I find myself not questioning managerial decisions as much.&nbsp; It's pure and it's America's past-time.</p>
<p>We take it all too seriously.&nbsp; It's ridiculous how closely we, and the rest of the Cubs blog-world, watches these guys.&nbsp; It's absurd, the scrupulous nature of our attention to the Cubs.&nbsp; But it's what fandom has become and there's no turning back.&nbsp; So I will watch the Cubs on television and critique every step and every swing.&nbsp; I'll just listen to the radio broadcasts of west coast games for my "love of the game" fix now.</p>
