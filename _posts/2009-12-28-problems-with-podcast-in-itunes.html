<p>If you have not been able to download the last few podcast episodes in iTunes and you are getting the "invalid podcast URL" error message, we apologize.</p>
<p>You can listen to the podcasts right here on the site.</p>
<p>We are trying to get this resolved and thank you for your patience.&nbsp; I suppose it's better to have these problems now, rather than in the middle of the season.</p>
