    of coming up with good pitches to intimidate the batter, you've crossed that unwritten

<p style="text-align: center;"></p><br />
Vicente Padilla is a decent pitcher, and he definitely made the Cubs look terrible on Sunday night.&nbsp; During that game, he threw 75 out of 106 pitches for strikes.&nbsp; One of the 31 pitches that was out of the strike zone struck Marlon Byrd on the back.&nbsp; So was it intentional?&nbsp; Marlon Byrd thought it was.&nbsp; After the game he said, "When a guy's throwing a two-hit shutout and he's pinpoint all day long, and you get hit with a four-seamer, you have to question it sometimes."</p>
<p>So why would a guy who is pitching lights out (the Cubs managed two hits in the game) all of a sudden decide to uncork a fastball way inside on a likable player like Marlon Byrd?&nbsp; Well, it turns out that when Byrd and Padilla were teammates on the Rangers, Byrd <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/stories/DN-ranglede_08spo.ART.State.Edition2.4c0f5a4.html" target="_blank">made it clear that he was glad</a> when Padilla was placed on waivers.&nbsp; Apparently Padilla was just about as poisonous to the Rangers' clubhouse as Milton Bradley was to the Cubs.&nbsp; Byrd wasn't the only one to express jubilation at Padilla's departure.&nbsp; According to the linked <em>Dallas News</em> article, "Handshakes were exchanged, and Ian Kinsler went so far        as to say, 'Congrats' [to Rangers' GM Jon Daniels]."&nbsp; The same article mentions how Padilla often didn't show up to team meetings, and "he would escape to the clubhouse during games to check        e-mail and surf the Internet."&nbsp; So Byrd thought that Padilla was a negative influence on the younger players, and he made it known.&nbsp; Padilla also has a history of headhunting.&nbsp; You may remember a game in '09 in which Padilla <a href="http://mlb.fanhouse.com/2009/06/02/no-love-lost-between-ex-teammates-teixeira-padilla/" target="_blank">hit his former teammate Mark Teixeira</a> twice.&nbsp; This guy is a turd.</p>
<p>Vicente Padilla has pitched for twelve seasons in the majors.&nbsp; I wanted to compare his stats to another twelve-season veteran, and of course, Ted Lilly came to mind immediately.&nbsp; Over his twelve seasons of service, Padilla has hit 105 batters with a pitch while Lilly has only hit 48, and Lilly actually has quite a few more innings pitched.&nbsp; So Padilla has to have a lot more walks than Lilly, right?&nbsp; Obviously control has to be an issue, right?&nbsp; Well, Lilly has walked 561 during his career to only 517 for Padilla.&nbsp; So my conclusion is that Padilla uses the mound to exact petty revenge in the form of errant four-seam fastballs.</p>
