<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08-300x240.jpg" alt="cubs logo" width="300" height="240" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9462" /></a>The 2014 amateur draft, in my eyes, took an abrupt turn for the worse when the top three arms (Brady Aiken, Tyler Kolek, Carlos Rodon) came off the board before the Cubs were on the clock with the 4<sup>th</sup> overall selection. The front office, undeterred, picked Kyle Schwarber, a catcher/outfielder from Indiana University. The powerful lefty was widely considered the best bat in the class and the Cubs, no stranger to taking polished, collegiate position players atop the first round (sup, Kris Bryant), added another middle-of-the-order masher to their already menacing minor league mix.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Cubs&nbsp;took Jake Stinnett, a college righty out of Maryland, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> round and another catcher, Mark Zagunis, in the 3<sup>rd</sup>. At this point, I was a bit confused and disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t dislike any of the selections by any means, but my insatiable thirst for a top-of-the-rotation caliber arm remained&nbsp;unquenched. That feeling wouldn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>In rounds 4-6, the Cubs added three high-ceiling high school arms in Carson Sands, Justin Steele, and Dylan Cease and all of a sudden, the overall plan for the draft became, at once, obvious and exciting, scary and riveting: take under slot guys early, use the savings to convince otherwise college-bound, 'tough sign' pitchers to go pro instead.</p>
<p>Kyle Schwarber inked&nbsp;for just over $3mm, about $1.5mm under slot. Jake Stinnett has not signed yet, but as a college senior is widely expected to sign an under slot deal. Zagunis&rsquo; reported deal saved Chicago about $100,000 to use on other draftees.</p>
<p>While Schwarber was redefining &lsquo;Short Season Ball&rsquo; in Boise this week, going 12-20 with four homers and 10 RBI in just five games before earning a quick promotion to Kane County, the Cubs were putting their early round draft savings to good use.</p>
<p>Highly touted lefty and Florida State commit Carson Sands signed for $1.1mm, getting more than $600,000 over slot to join the Cubs instead of the &lsquo;Noles. Sands will bring a 94 MPH heater, solid deuce, and developing change-up to Mesa as the Arizona League approaches&nbsp;opening day.</p>
<p>Another southpaw, 5<sup>th</sup> rounder Justin Steele was set to go to Southern Miss before signing a $1mm deal (~$640,000 over-slot) with Chicago. Steele's fastball sits in the low 90s and he was ranked in the top-70 of this class by my publication&nbsp;of choice, Baseball Prospectus.</p>
<p>6<sup>th</sup> rounder Dylan Cease was considered by some a candidate for a top-15 overall pick before a UCL injury cut his senior season short and coupled with a commitment to Vanderbilt, scared Major League clubs away. Before the elbow ailment, Cease had been clocked as high as 98 MPH and the Cubs are expected to make a strong play to lure the athletic righty&nbsp;away from the Commodores, likely offering a deal similar to those of Sands and Steele and making the teenager a millionaire to pitch in Cubbie Blue.</p>
<p>With another thirty-some draftees in the pipeline, signing Cease won&rsquo;t mean the end of the Cubs 2014 draft negotiations but it would tie an awful pretty bow on a six-round run that could produce a big time &lsquo;steal&rsquo;&hellip;or three.</p>
