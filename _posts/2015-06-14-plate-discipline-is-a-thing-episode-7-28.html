<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_8903.png"><img data-id="11270"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_8903-300x300.png" alt="IMG_8903" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11270" /></a>On this week's episode of the podcast, Andy and Corey are in the same studio and discussing several Cubs topics.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are in four-game series with the Reds and because we are recording earlier in the day on Sunday, we can't talk about the complete series.  We do talk about the things that have stood out to us in the first 3 games of the series. </p>
<p>We have several meet-ups and events scheduled this summer and we run through them.  You can find information on our annual weekend at the lake here - <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/lake" target="_blank">2015 Ivy Envy Weekend at the Lake</a>.</p>
<p>We answer a few listener questions.  We talk about what the Cubs might get in return for Jonathan Papelbon.  We also talk about why the Cubs would need to improve the bullpen.  Michael from Colorado floats an idea for the #5 spot in the rotation.  Chris Archer is good and used to be a Cub.  Would there be a place for Ryne Sandberg in the organization? We talk about what three players we'd like to see the Cubs call up and send down.  </p>
<p>Rafael from Brazil emails in his disappointing social experience when he was surrounded with Cubs fans.  We talk about the idea of catchers trying to distract hitters through "sledging".  And we talk eye black.</p>
