<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt discuss Marmol's arbitration, the Spring Training broadcast schedule for the Cubs, Wrigley losing her roof and the last event in a long line of unfortunate events that Harry Caray's statue has experienced.&nbsp; We also use the opportunity to share our feelings about White Sox fans.</p>
<p>This will be our last off-season episode and we are very eager to start talking about the 2011 season.&nbsp; We return to our round-table format next weekend.</p>
