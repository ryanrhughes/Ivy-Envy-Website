  content: No way Soriano makes either of those plays in the field.  I can say that
    with absolute certainty.  Soriano has "much regard for his body".  And I don't
    think it's just to stay healthy.  It's so he doesn't run out of breath, too.

  content: I actually thought maybe Soriano would have made the first play, but would
    certainly not have made the second play.

  content: And this vid doesn't include the home run he stole from Man Ram in another
    game in that series. My high school basketball coach would be handing out the
    "hustle award" right now.

<p>With the Cubs playing highly irritating-to-watch baseball right now, it's time to grasp at any positives we can.&nbsp; If you missed yesterday's game, you saved yourself some pain.&nbsp; However, you did miss some awesome Sam Fuld highlights.&nbsp; Look what Fuld can do in left field that a certain other player (I'll give you a hint: it starts with "A" and ends with "lfonso Soriano") couldn't.&nbsp; He also can steal bases!&nbsp; Imagine that!&nbsp; You <strong>must</strong> check out the following Sam Fuld highlights from yesterday's game:</p>
