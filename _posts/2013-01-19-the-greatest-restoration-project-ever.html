The Cubs have been talking about a major overhaul of Wrigley Field at Cubs Convention today, and various sources in attendance have been sharing some of the details. &nbsp;Cubs fans have long speculated on what the Cubs would do with the beloved yet decrepit stadium, and now they have a better idea of what is going to happen. &nbsp;Carrie Muskat, Bruce Miles, Paul Sullivan, Bleacher Nation and others have been keeping their Twitter followers abreast of the planned upgrades, and here are some of their tweets:</p>
<ul>
<li>@BruceMiles2112: Batting cages, bigger dugouts and clubhouse as well as new bi-level press box at Wrigley. Hey-hey! #Cubs</li>
<li>@PWSullivan: Wooden roof to be removed, new grandstand roof. All seats in bowl removed and replaced. Undergroud batting cages.</li>
<li>@CarrieMuskat: Applause at increasing restrooms 42 percent at Wrigley. #Cubs</li>
<li>@CubsTalkCSN: Cubs took tours of Fenway, Lambeau and Rose Bowl to learn from recent updates to each stadium.</li>
<li>@BruceMiles2112: #Cubs will NOT play elsewhere while work is done.</li>
<li>Bleacher Nation: Dramatically increased player facilities, restrooms, concessions, communications, and an outdoor patio servicing upper deck. #CubsCon</li><br />
</ul><br />
Bleacher Nation also shared the following interesting photo:&nbsp;<a href="http://pic.twitter.com/c7ZZCzFL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/c7ZZCzFL</a></p>
<p>Along with the changes to the basic infrastructure, the team also wants to enhance the overall fan experience by adding a couple new restaurants (one on the third-base side of the building and one under the scoreboard) and an interactive kids area in the triangle. &nbsp;There are also plans to add a fan deck in left field to compliment the patio in right.</p>
<p>One major omission that people have oft longed for the Cubs to add is more parking. &nbsp;That is an addition that would greatly enhance my fan experience, but at any rate, these changes sound like they will make a day at Wrigley that much better without sacrificing too much of the traditional baseball feel that many fans love so much. &nbsp;The renovation is supposed to start after the 2013 season and will last about five years. &nbsp;Oh yeah, and the Ricketts family is paying for it.</p>
