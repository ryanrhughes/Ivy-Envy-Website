    quite a few guys.

<p>The newest Chicago Cub is 23 year old RHP Jacob Turner, acquired in a trade from the Miami Marlins for two pitchers, Tyler Bremer (Kane County) and Jose Arias (Kane County). Turner was claimed by the Cubs off revocable waivers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It's common for teams to place players (sometimes the entire team) on revocable waivers even when they have no intention of trading them because they are, as the name suggests, revocable. If the player is claimed and you don't like the deal the claiming team is offering there is essentially no consequence in pulling him back. If a player clears waivers you are free to trade him to any team.</p>
<p>This deal had one more layer of complexity. The Marlins had DFA'd Turner before putting him on waivers to clear a roster spot. Had they pulled him back they would have to place him on outright waivers and a team could claim him without needing to work out a trade. </p>
<p>I'm still scratching my head as to why, A) the Marlins didn't have more patience to see if he could turn it around and B) the Rockies (worst record/first dibs) did not claim Turner. They could have claimed him and offered nothing in return. The Marlins would have no leverage. They could pull him back and then have to place him on outright waivers where the Rockies could just claim him again. Perhaps that breaks some rules but it looks as if they could have landed him for almost nothing.</p>
<p>With the Rockies passing, the Cubs saw an opportunity to land a young, high upside pitcher with some risk at a low cost. Turner will make $1 million on a club option in 2015 and is under team control through 2018.&nbsp;The Marlins were&nbsp;in a position to have to accept almost any offer by the Cubs. They could really only pull him back and let the Rockies or Diamondbacks (now ahead of the Cubs on the waiver list) have him for nothing.</p>
<p>Here's the catch. The Cubs must place and keep Turner on the 25 man roster since he has no minor league options remaining. His performance has been off this year. He's 4-7 with a near 6 ERA. The Cubs are hoping his recent performance can be corrected and he can return to something closer to his original projection as the no. 9 overall pick in the 2009 draft. It looks like this will bump Wada back to Iowa after today's start. He's pitched&nbsp;well, but doesn't offer the same potential as Turner.</p>
<p>Given Chris Bosio's track record with reclamation projects this looks like a great move by the Cubs. They don't lose much and gain another potential piece of their future rotation.</p>
