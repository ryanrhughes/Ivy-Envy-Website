  content: "Hi\n\t\n\t\n\t\nIm responding to a question you raised on the podcast.\n\nWho
    listens to the game radio broadcast?\n\nI do.  I'm a 71 year old woman who\nlives
    in Australia.  I was raised in the Chicago Suburbs.  Growing up\nI listened to
    the Cubs on the radio.  My grandmother lived in Flint. \nShe listened to the Tigers.
    \ One of my prized possessions is a score\ncard my Grandmother filled in at the
    1945 World Series.   \n\n\nI love the radio broadcast .  Some\nmornings it starts
    as early as 4 am here in Australia. But thanks to\nMLB, I have the broadcast on
    my iphone.   But you are right.\nSomething has happened.  The characters are still
    the same:  it's\nstill Pat and Ron (and I think they picked Ron Coomer because
    he is\nsimilar to Ron Santo)...  Pat is a a wonderful commentator- he is\n'old
    school' , a familiar, comforting voice.  But the program has\nchanged, it is different
    and is more like an informercial and less\nlike a baseball game.  It was only
    this week that I was wondering who\nto blame for overselling the radio time.  It
    has consequences and I\nthink Pat has lost the joy of broadcasting &hellip;. except
    for the fact\nthat it's our Cubbies out there playing.\n\nBefore I close I want
    to  mention just\none more thing about your profile of a radio listener. \n\nWe
    aren't all old guys  in a garage. \nDon't underestimate us. I saw Moneyball. I
    know about Sabremetrics.  \nDon't ask me to do the calculations, but I am interested.
    \ And if the\nCubs play Boston in the World Series,  I want to be sharing popcorn\nwith
    Theo Epstein."

  content: I'm replying to my own post because today's radio broadcast of the second
    game in Atlanta is the best called game I've heard in a long time. &nbsp;Excellent!

<p>The biggest news in Cubs-land this week is the promotion of prospect, Albert Almora.  On this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about Almora's impact on the team and the Soler injury that led to his promotion.  We also talk about reasonable expectations for Almora and why some Cubs fans have unrealistic expectations on different prospects.  </p>
<p>We briefly talk about the Cubs series win over the Phillies, mainly focusing on pitching.  </p>
<p>We have several listener questions to answer, from the serious to the silly. Corey shares some scary stats and throws in a rare mid-week internet muscle flex.  </p>
<p>For information on John Baker Day, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/johnbaker" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/johnbaker</a>.  This will be a great event and you will have the opportunity to take home this artwork, which will be signed by all five 2015 Cubs rookies.<br />
