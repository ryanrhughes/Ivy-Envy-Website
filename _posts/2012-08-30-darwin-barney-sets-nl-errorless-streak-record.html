In a season with very few bright spots, Darwin Barney earned a spot in the record books last night by playing in his 114th consecutive game at second base without an error.  </p>
<p>The record did not come without some drama, as Barney was originally charged with an error in the 7th inning, but it was later changed and charged to Luis Valbuena by official scorer Bob Rosenberg.  Barney has one error at 2nd base this season (his other came at shortstop), and has a fielding percentage of .998. Barney had 12 errors in 2011, his first full season.  Barney earned a spot on the Cubs roster during Spring Training in 2011 by working hard, and it's clear that he's maintained that work ethic.  </p>
<p>Given the turnover and instability of the current Cubs roster as Epstein and Hoyer attempt to mold this team, Barney will probably be a distant memory years down the road and many riders on future Ivy Envy Bus Trips will miss the trivia question "Which former Cubs 2nd baseman holds the NL record for the most consecutive errorless games?"  </p>
<p>Right now, we'll recognize Barney for a great accomplishment, and something from the 2012 season that makes us feel like we have something on the field worth recognizing.  </p>
