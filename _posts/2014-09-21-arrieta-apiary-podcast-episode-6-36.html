  content: Regarding Myrtle Beach, my wife,  kids and I have been to games in Peoria,
    Boise, Kane County, Daytona, (Kodak) Tennessee,  Des Moines  and Wrigley.  Last
    summer we went to every Cubs affiliate.  I drive an 18 wheeler and stop in at
    Minor League parks when I can.

Right now, about the only thing that excites Cubs fans is Jake Arrieta near no-hitters.  We talk about his pitching performance against the Reds, his performance this season and his chances at being the #1 starter for the 2015 Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>The anti-Arrieta has been Edwin Jackson.  He comes back from injury and lasts 2/3 of an inning against the Dodgers.  We talk about where things stand with Jackson and look at the Cubs' options with Jackson in 2015.  </p>
<p>This week brought a slew of changes in the Cubs minor league system.  Boise, Kane County and Daytona were replaced by Eugene, South Bend and Myrtle Beach.  The constant theme through these moves is the available facilities.  </p>
<p>We answer listener questions, Kurt gives us a scary stat of the week and we read two internet muscle flexes. </p>
