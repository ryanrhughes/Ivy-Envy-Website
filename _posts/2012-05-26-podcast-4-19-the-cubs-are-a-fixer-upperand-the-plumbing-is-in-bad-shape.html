<p>Bob from Moline joins Corey and Kurt on this week's episode.  Kurt describes his experience at Principal Park in Des Moines to see the Iowa Cubs play.  He tells you why maybe you shouldn't get too excited about Anthony Rizzo's Nintendo numbers in the Pacific Coast League.  </p>
<p>The Cubs extended their current losing streak to 10 games and we discuss our abilities to stay interested and engaged with this team.  We also spend a lot of time talking about the future of the organization and the idea of short-term thinking versus long-term vision.  One key piece in that conversation is Anthony Rizzo and when he gets called up to the big league team.  </p>
<p>We also discuss how different types of fans are reacting and will react to a deconstruction of the current team and building for the future.  Jason from Moline, Nick from Virginia, Ben from Streamwood, Oscar from California toss some topics to us on our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and we take a look at those.  </p>
<p>There are quite a few scary stats sprinkled throughout the episode and Kurt gives some really scary stats in his segment.  And, we wrap up the show by picking a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
