  content: Andy jinxed the Angels by lusting after their lead-off guy.  Aybar hyper-extended
    his knee last night against the Brewers.

  content: "OK, a couple of things...\r\n\r\nFirst of all when it comes to Zambrano's
    value, you have to talk about his relational value of sorts.  For instance an
    average paid pitcher of that caliber would have trade value.  At $17 millions
    dollars, he has no trade value.\r\n\r\nSecond, Ramirez has some trade value at
    third.  It's because of the lack of overall talent at the position he plays, but
    still...If we're going to make the moves, we might as well start with him to kind
    of get the ball rolling and let all the other owners know there's a fire sale,
    if they don't already.\r\n\r\nAnd if I remember correctly, the Angels got killed
    by the Brewers the other night.  It's a long season, but I can see LAA in it near
    the end.  And of course if they play New York I'm the biggest Angels fan in the
    world.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"
