  content: That probably knocked him down 10 or 15%; we won't see him till May now.

    host our wives/fiances/girlfriends and talk about how obsession with the
    Cubs.  \r\n\r\nWe will have to re-visit the baseball card collections at some
    point."

  content: "Last year was statistically his worst year since '01. His contract was
    based on his 46 hr and 41 sb in Washington. So, by my calculations, at 75-80%
    we should expect 34-38 home runs. I'll concede the stolen bases.\r\n\r\nIn all
    seriousness, I think we'll see statistically good years out of Soriano, but will
    better stats help the team? Will he hit 25 solo shots or get doubles with men
    on? I think we know the answer to that question."

  content: "In theory, his placement in the batting order should help keep his solo
    HR's to a minimum and he should get more RBI's.  His role in the 5 or 6 spot will
    be to drive the top half of the order.\r\n\r\n....In theory."

  content: Where was he batting last year? To be honest, I don't know if he has it
    in him to do much in any place. I don't buy the injury excuse for last year, I
    think he is just getting old and lazy.

  content: "If I remember correctly, he spent most of the first half of the season
    in the lead-off spot.  I think there were a few games stretches in which he was
    moved out of it, but he was the regular lead-off guy.  \r\n\r\nI think it was
    right around the All-Star break that they moved him to the 5-hole."

  content: "You did remember correctly Corey\r\n\r\nAnd for the record, I see him
    at the five spot a majority of this year.  Also for the record, that's an awful
    lot of money to be paying somebody to hit in the 5 hole.\r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The 2009 season is something we'd all like to forget.  The injuries and dysfunction weighed heavily throughout 2009 and hopes are high that 2010 will be different on both fronts.</p>
<p>I am not a Soriano fan and I was outspoken about this last year.  He earned two swipes from me in the "Most Hated Cubs Player of 2009" contest at our first live event at Twenty Sports Grille.  Soriano ended up winning that contest, by the way.  I wasn't the only one ready to express my frustrations with the liability in left field.  </p>
<p><center>[media id=2 width=320 height=240]</center></p>
<p>But I decided to try to accept Soriano for who he is in 2010.  He won't show the effort we'd like to see.  He won't play with his head in the game.  He will be below-average in the field.  But if he is healthy and pitchers forgot to throw him sliders in the dirt, his power should return this season.</p>
<p>Soriano reported to Spring Training in Mesa today and started things off by reporting that he's 75%-80% recovered from his September arthroscopic knee surgery.  He also said that he doesn't want to push things too quickly.  That sounds like the Soriano I know.  </p>
<p>Fellow Cubs fans, it will be the 2015 season until we see a roster without Alfonso Soriano.  He will earn $90 million between now and then.  That's right, he is still owed 2/3 of this contract.  And he'll do it all with a little hop and a grin on his face.</p>
