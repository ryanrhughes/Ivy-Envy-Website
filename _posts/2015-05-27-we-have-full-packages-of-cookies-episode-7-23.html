<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Photo-May-27-9-56-43-PM.png"><img data-id="11220"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Photo-May-27-9-56-43-PM-300x300.png" alt="Photo May 27, 9 56 43 PM" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-11220" /></a>On this mid-week episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast, we're talking about the first few games in the Cubs series with the Nationals.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have played several 1-run games this season, winning quite a few of them.  We talk about all of the close games that the Cubs are playing against good competition.  </p>
<p>Kris Bryant hit a home run off the new video board in left-center field.  We weren't optimistic about a Cubs player accomplishing that in our season prediction episode.  </p>
<p>The back end of the rotation has performed very well lately.  Wada and Hendricks have both stepped up with good outings, right when the Cubs needed some stability in that part of the rotation.  </p>
<p>We also talk about Jason McLeod's recent comments on Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber.  </p>
