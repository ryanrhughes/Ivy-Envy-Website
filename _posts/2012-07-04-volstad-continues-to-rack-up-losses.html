  content: Just shut that game off. I was watching it on MLB.TV. I shut it off when
    it was 10-3. Let's not forget to share some hate for Dolis.

  content: Good Sveum quote BTW. I'm liking him as the manager more and more as the
    season goes along. He seems to be the kind of manager that players will like to
    play for because they respect him and not because they like him.

<p>The Cubs brought Chris Volstad up from Iowa for a second chance and a start against the Braves in Atlanta Tuesday night.  Volstad didn't exactly go to Iowa and dominate in the Pacific Coast League.  In his 8 games with Iowa, he had a 2-3 record with a 4.44 ERA.  Those numbers are pretty similar to the numbers that Travis Wood had in Iowa, but his results with the Chicago Cubs have been quite different.</p>
<p>Volstad earned the loss in Tuesday's game and promptly ended the Cubs 4-game winning streak.  The loss dropped Volstad to 0-7 with the Cubs in 2012.  Volstad is nearing a full calendar year without a major league win.  His last win was July 10th, when he was with the Marlins.  In the 20 starts since his last win, Volstad is 0-12 with a 5.68 ERA.  </p>
<p>The 40-year old Chipper Jones went 2-2 off Volstad and laid the groundwork for a career-type game.  Jones went  5-5 with two doubles and 4 RBIs, raising his batting average 22 points by the end of the evening.  After the game, Volstad stated he's trying to pitch "too perfect".  </p>
<blockquote><p>I think it's a matter of me trying to be perfect and too fine and trying to be better than I have to be.  Nobody's perfect, so how can I expect myself to be?</blockquote></p>
<p>Dale Sveum does not agree and <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2012_07_03_chnmlb_atlmlb_1&mode=recap&c_id=chc" target="_blank">had some strong words</a> for Volstad.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Not much has changed, obviously.  It was another big inning. There was still some hard contact going on before that [inning], and his stuff and location wasn't all that good anyway. The ball wasn't down. It didn't seem as if anything was sinking very good.</p>
<p>He didn't pitch to the game plan either. That was a little bit discouraging, too. He shook [catcher Steve Clevenger] off a lot for some reason. Another combination of a lot of things he's got to learn to work on.</blockquote></p>
<p>This statement, and the fact that management has shown very little patience with pitchers not performing well (Randy Wells), perhaps Volstad's under some pressure with the Cubs and I wouldn't expect him to spend much more time with the big league club this year.  </p>
<p>Volstad is only 25 years old, so hopefully there's some time for the organization to find some solution to his pitching woes.  On the topic of Volstad's age, I was looking at his <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/v/volstch01.shtml" target="_blank">Baseball Reference page</a> and was a bit baffled by the players listed as being most similar to Volstad at the age of 24.  Those on the list are:  Jeff Weaver, Frank Viola, Tom Glavine and Ryan Dempster.  Try and figure that one out.  </p>
