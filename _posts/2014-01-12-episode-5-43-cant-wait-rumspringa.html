<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt are back in the saddle after a week off from talking about the Chicago Cubs.  Last week, we posted an interview with Dan Campana and Rob Carroll on their book <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wrigleybook" target="_blank">"Wrigley Field: 100 Stories for 100 Years."</a>  If you didn't hear this episode, you can go back and listen here - <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-42-interview-dan-campana-rob-carrollwrigley-field-100-stories-100-years/" target="_blank">Episode 5.42</a>  Also, Corey sat in on the <a href="http://wrigleyvillenation.com/2014/01/01/wrigleyville-nation-ep-5-guest-ivy-envy/" target="_blank">5th episode of the Wrigleyville Nation Podcast</a>.  </p>
<p>We start things off by reading through some iTunes reviews.  These help us tremendously.  Corey talks about his time in Vegas for the Podcast Awards and New Media Expo.  He also talks about his experience at CES, although the trip from the hotel to CES was probably more exciting than CES itself.  ESPN won the award for the best Sports Podcast and congrats to them for beating this "lowly Chicago Cubs podcast."  </p>
<p>We are 12 days into January and Kurt has already broken his 2014 Cubs resolution.  There is not much news with the Cubs, or really all of baseball right now.  The only thing worth talking about is Tanaka and we are becoming increasingly less optimistic that he will be pitching for the Chicago Cubs.  We answer a few listener questions about Tanaka.  </p>
<p>A-Rod is in the news and a few listeners ask us questions about him.  One of which asks which Chicago Cubs player we would give a 162 game suspension to.  Benjamin suggests we get our Internet Muscle Flexes for this episode from articles on the Jay Cutler signing.  We find a few.  Corey also reads a few Internet Muscle Flexes from Cubs.com articles.  </p>
<p>We go through the entries for the photo caption contest and pick a winner.<br />
