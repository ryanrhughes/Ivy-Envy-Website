  If anyone can explain this "blacked out" thing to me, I'd really appreciate it.&nbsp; In relation to the rest of the country, most of us on this blog are within a stone's throw of Chicago.&nbsp; We are way outside the Chicago television market, though.&nbsp;

  content: I dont know why they do it but it pisses me off!  I'm from Iowa and a huge
    Cub fan and couldn't watch it last night!  Had to listen to the damn radio.  Finally
    a night game that I could watch and they blacked it out!  ESPN News.........the
    east and west coast could watch it but the midwest couldn't.......

  content: I can't answer your question, but I was frustrated about not being able
    to watch the game!  I love being able to watch when the offense really comes to
    life.

    Aaron-
    I actually like listening to Pat and Ron on the radio while I watch the games on tv.  But I hear you...when the Cubs are pouring on the runs like they did last night, I'd like to be able to see it, visually.

    Thanks for reading the blog.  All of us except adeadcat are from the Quad Cities.

    Keep stopping in and feel free to comment.

<p>So I flip on ESPN tonight and it's ESPN news.&nbsp; I just don't get it.&nbsp; This area is brimming with Cubs fans, but we don't get to see the game.&nbsp; Some guy in Idaho that doesn't care at all about the Cubs gets to watch them.</p>
<p>Why is this game blacked out?</p>
