  content: Well, Corey, I will be there, so I don't think you can completely deliver
    on the non-douchebag promise.  But I do promise to not throw beer on anyone, well
    that is until the Cubs lose to the Natinals.

  content: To clarify, I'm more of a post-98 Cubs fan, but thanks for the compliment.
    Most of my early days of fandom were spent with the same kind of d-bags in my
    dorm at ISU.

<p>I know it's been talked about all day today and the last thing that is needed is another opinion on the matter, but seriously, what an asshat.&nbsp; Of course, I'm speaking of the guy in the front row in the white shirt.&nbsp; The second he threw the beer at Shane Victorino, I was completely embarrassed to consider myself a Cubs fan.&nbsp; That photo right there shows exactly what people think about when they hear "Cubs fans".&nbsp; We are no longer the loyal supporters of the Loveable Losers, in their eyes.&nbsp; People think that Cubs fans are massive douchebags hanging out at the only bar in the world that holds 40,000 people.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that everyone that started following the Cubs after 2003 are idiots.&nbsp; Kurt is the best post-2003 fan I know.&nbsp; But the vast majority of them are like that little cross-section in the photo.&nbsp; Look at them all and their shit-eating grins.&nbsp; I mean, the guy was wearing white arm-bands on both arms.&nbsp; Yeah, it's a hot August evening in Chicago, but do your arms really sweat that much?</p>
<p>The fact is, Bartman acted without thinking and did something that many, if not most, Cubs fans would do.&nbsp; What this guy did was not a reaction.&nbsp; It was an aggressive douchey thing he did to make his frat buddies laugh.</p>
<p>It was all easier when the Cubs sucked and everyone knew they suck.&nbsp; It was embarrassing to be a Cubs fan.&nbsp; It showed a lack of judgement.&nbsp; I miss those days.</p>
<p>In case you haven't heard, come hang out with us non-douchebag Cubs fans at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline on August 25th during the Cubs vs. Nationals game.&nbsp; We promise that a guy won't throw beer on you.</p>
