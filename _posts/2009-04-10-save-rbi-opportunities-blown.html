<p>It was a tough loss today.&nbsp; I didn't get to watch much of the game, but I did get home to see the end and Koyie Hill spike the ball in frustration.&nbsp; So, should we start worrying about Gregg?&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; Cotts was much more to blame for the loss Tuesday than Gregg.&nbsp; Inheriting base runners in a high pressure situation is never good.&nbsp; There were some good things that happened today--Bradley got the first hit monkey off his back, and that hit happened to be a homer.&nbsp; Fukudome continued to hit the ball today.&nbsp; Harden got ten strikeouts in an outing reminiscent of a 10-K performance he had last July for the Cubs.</p>
<p>The main problem with today is that Lee, Bradley, and Ramirez left eight men on base among the three of them.&nbsp; However since there are no trends to worry about yet, we can just hope that these bats show up tomorrow, and that the Cubs destroy the Brewers.&nbsp; And give Bernie a day off from that damn slide.</p>
