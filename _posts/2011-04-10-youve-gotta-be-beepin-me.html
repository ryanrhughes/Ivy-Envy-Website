  content: There was a solid 5 minutes of laughter in the backyard last night when
    Castro took that throw to the face.  Growing pains, I guess.

  content: Also, while watching that game last night, the first thing I said when
    Pena made that play was "There's no way Lee makes that play".

  content: You really think Lee wouldn't have snagged that ball?

  content: Not the Lee of the last few years.  He's lost a step.  Plus I think Lee
    got more conservative in his play with his back/neck issues.  The only advantage
    he would have on that play is that it was hit to his glove-side.  Pena had to
    reach across his body.

<p>The above quotation was uttered by Hawk Harrelson after Tampa Bay's <a href="http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110409&amp;content_id=17570272&amp;vkey=news_tb&amp;c_id=tb">Sam Fuld made an amazing diving catch</a> yesterday.&nbsp; I wish I could embed the clip, but I can't (Corey wrote <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4707">a good post dealing with this issue</a>).&nbsp; I figure that we can expect Reed Johnson to make a couple catches like this for the Cubs, and he should hit better than .222.</p>
<p>Also, if you missed it, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=13616045&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">Carlos Pena had a great defensive play</a> yesterday as well.&nbsp; It was D-Lee-esque.</p>
<p>One guy who failed to "see the ball into the glove" in yesterday's game was Starlin Castro.&nbsp; <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/video/play.jsp?content_id=13635417&amp;query=%26game_pk%3D287001" target="_blank">He caught the ball with his face</a>.</p>
<p>I love great defensive plays.&nbsp; I almost enjoy defense more than offense sometimes.&nbsp; But I would've really enjoyed even a little offense from the Cubs yesterday.&nbsp; Hopefully today will be a different story.</p>
