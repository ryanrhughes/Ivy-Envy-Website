  content: "After the terrible fielding of the first game, I was relieved to see 'em
    pick it up in the third game. \r\n\r\nThere were a few really nice defensive plays
    in the third game of the series. Fukudome saved a run by bare-handing that ball
    in the right field corner and getting it back to the infield extremely quickly.
    Colvin made a nice play on a line drive which may have gone past Soriano if he
    was in the game. Also, those terrible middle infielders actually completed some
    double plays. \r\n\r\nGame two's loss was a result of 1 pitcher throwing terribly
    to two batters. Grabow also threw terribly in the third game but thankfully Piniella
    got him out of there before any damage was done. Clearly the Cubs need to put
    up more runs, but they also need to rely on their bullpen to shut guys down. \r\n\r\nEven
    though I decided to quit the Cubs forever and become a Giants fan after the first
    game ('cause I have a boner for Lincecum), I am feeling a little more optimistic
    after the 2nd and 3rd games."

<p>The Cubs wrapped up their opening series in Atlanta last night and head to Cincinnati for their first look at an NL Central Division foe.&nbsp; So let&rsquo;s take a look back at this, the first series in the 2010 season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Monday:&nbsp; Braves 16 &ndash; Cubs 5</strong></p><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pitching: </span> Zambrano was bad, Samardzija was worse.&nbsp; Zambrano leaves with a 54.00 ERA and Samardzija sits at a 108.00 ERA. &nbsp;&nbsp;Jason Heyward gives people in Georgia a reason to claim they are not racist.&nbsp; Marshall comes in for relief in the 2<sup>nd</sup> inning and holds the thing together.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Batting:</span> Ramirez and Byrd hit homeruns and Fukudome goes 2-3 with a double, a walk and two runs scored.&nbsp; Theriot, Fontenot, Soriano and Soto go 4-4 with names that rhyme, but a combined 0-17 at the plate.</p>
<p>I really tried to keep my cool after this game and put it into perspective.&nbsp; I did an average job at these things.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wednesday:&nbsp; Braves 3 &ndash; Cubs 2</strong></p><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pitching:</span> Dempster was on a mission, striking out 9 batters in 6 innings.&nbsp; He gave up only three hits and one run.&nbsp; Marshall pitches another hitless inning and strikes out two.&nbsp; John Grabow blows the save and gets his first loss on the season after giving up a homerun to Chipper Jones with one on and one out in the bottom of the 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Batting:</span> Soriano, while still not looking completely comfortable at the plate, went 2-4 with a double and a run scored.&nbsp; Theriot goes 0-3, raising his batting average to .000 on the season.&nbsp; He does get an RBI off a sacrifice fly.&nbsp; Cliffy Six Nad (Xavier Clifford Nady VI) has the opportunity to endear himself to Cubs fans ala Marlon Byrd, but comes up empty and strikes out against the flame-throwing Billy Wagner.&nbsp; By the way, the Cubs go 0-4 with runners in scoring position.</p>
<p>I was not able to stay calm after this game.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t necessarily that I panicked that Cubs were 0-2 and would be incapable of recovering from such a deficit in the division.&nbsp; It just all felt too familiar.&nbsp; The blown save, the failure to knock in runs with guys in scoring position.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen this type of stuff before and I know how it&rsquo;s ended before.&nbsp; Sadly, I start lowering my expectations for the season.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Thursday:</strong> <strong>Cubs 2 &ndash; Braves 0</strong></p><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pitching:</span> Randy Wells gets the first win in the rotation and the Cubs pitch a combined shutout.&nbsp; Marshall pitches 2/3 of an inning.&nbsp; In 2010, he has pitched 4 1/3 inning and has yet to allow a baserunner, while striking out seven.&nbsp; Caridad and Marmol assist with the shutout.&nbsp; Grabow is on record, but does he really deserve any positive recognition after facing one batter and walking him?&nbsp; As a <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2203" target="_blank">Jeff Samardzija fan</a>, I am grateful that Grabow&rsquo;s performances have been distracting negative attention away from Samardzija.&nbsp; Marmol gets his first save of the year and made Jason Heyward look silly on three straight sliders.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Batting:</span> Solo homeruns by Byrd (2<sup>nd</sup> on the year) and Tyler Colvin led the Cubs to victory and stave off a sweep by the Braves.&nbsp; Colvin was playing left field in place of Soriano.&nbsp; Derek Lee and Koyie Hill each had a hit.&nbsp; Aramis Ramirez went 0-3 with three strikeouts.&nbsp; The Cubs managed only 4 hits and combined to leave 12 men on base.&nbsp; They were also 0-5 with runners in scoring position.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Series Impressions:</span></strong></p><br />
Surprisingly, there are a few positives to take away from this series.&nbsp; There were some great pitching performances by Ryan Dempster, Randy Wells and Sean Marshall.&nbsp; Marlon Byrd settles in with the Cubs and hit two homeruns.&nbsp; Tyler Colvin created yet a little more hype by hitting his first career homerun in his first at-bat of the season.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Offensively, the Cubs have started out pretty weak.&nbsp; Theriot, in the lead-off spot is 0 for 2010.&nbsp; Lee managed just one base hit in 9 plate appearances.&nbsp; Obviously, we can&rsquo;t put too much stock in current batting averages, three games in.&nbsp; Here is a stat we can put stock in though:&nbsp; The Cubs are 2-13 with runners in scoring position.<strong><br />
</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What to watch for in the series against the Reds</span>:</strong></p></p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d      like to see the Cubs generate some runs without relying on homeruns.&nbsp; Of the 8 Cubs RBI&rsquo;s in 2010, 7 have been      the results of homeruns.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m      interested to see how Carlos Silva pitches tonight.&nbsp; After a terrible first outing in Spring      Training against the White Sox, Silva pitched pretty well after that.&nbsp; A good Carlos Silva helps this team, a      lot.</li>
<li>I am      also extremely interested to see how Carlos Zambrano bounces back from a      horrendous opening day.&nbsp; I will be      observing his performance during the <a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/2010/04/waiw-pub-crawl-reminder-edition.html" target="_blank">2nd Annual Wasting Away in Wrigleyville Pub      Crawl</a>.&nbsp; For the sanity of the 80+      people at the pub crawl and Cubs fans around the world, I hope Zambrano      pitches well.</li><br />
