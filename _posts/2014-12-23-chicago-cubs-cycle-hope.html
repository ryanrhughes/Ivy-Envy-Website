<p>I have a flag that flew on top of Wrigley Field this past year. I bought it at a Cubs Charities auction and it's pretty beat up. It's for the 1935 Cubs team, the winners of the National League pennant that year who fell to the Detroit Tigers in the World Series. It's a reminder of the past, a past in which the Cubs still managed to win pennants even if they were, at that point, almost three decades removed from their last World Series win. It's dirty, grimy and I love it.</p>
<p>But my wife, looking at it for the first time, asked, "Why didn't you just save some money and buy a flag that says 'I like sadness?'" Coming from a Cleveland fan, maybe the comment didn't cut as deep as it did coming from someone else. Maybe one of the many Giants fans I've surrounded by now, the ones who lamented the "torture" of close games... as the Giants worked their way toward their third World Series championship in five years.</p>
<p>But, now, in the glorious afterglow of the Jon Lester signing, it's kind of nice to see the Cubs have beaten out other teams at a big free agent signing. Or, at least a signing not involving Milton Bradley. The signing signals a new era for the Cubs, the culmination of what we've been waiting for during the rebuilding. And it signals a new cycle of hope.</p>
<p>Just like Red told Andy, hope is a dangerous thing, something Cubs fans know all to well. And even as we head into this new era of hope, it's a good time to look back at the previous cycles of hope the team has gone through.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2014/12/ryno.jpg"><img data-id="10702"  src="/uploads/2014/12/ryno-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10702" /></a><strong>1984: Ryno</strong><br />
With as much suffering as we've dealt with over the last generation or so, it's still been marked by glimpses of success every few years. When Ryne Sandberg tore through the National League East, taking the Cubs along with him, it was the first title of any sort that the Cubs had earned since 1945. The team finished up at 96-65 that year as Ryno earned the MVP (and there's the matter of the legendary "Sandberg Game") and Rick Sutcliffe's Cy Young campaign (in which he went 16-1, yes, just one loss). Jim Frey also won Manager of the Year honors. The loss to the Padres in the NLCS was heartbreaking, sure, but at least there was a glimmer of hope for the future. Unfortunately, 1985 was wrecked by injuries and then, well... nothing was the same as the Cubs sank back to the bottom of the division, the 1984 season the anomaly. </p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2014/12/maddux.jpg"><img data-id="10708"  src="/uploads/2014/12/maddux-214x300.jpg" alt="maddux" width="214" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-10708" /></a><strong>1989: Maddux, The Hawk, & Co.</strong><br />
Five years later, with Sandberg and Sutcliffe again turning in All-Star performances, the Cubs returned to the top of the division but this time with more help. There was Andre Dawson, over 12 seasons into his career but still cranking out productive seasons even as he missed nearly a third of the season; first baseman Mark Grace, coming off a great rookie season in which he had finished second behind Chris Sabo in ROY voting; and Jerome Walton who would win the 1989 ROY award. And there was an outstanding pitching staff, led, again, by Sutcliffe and reliever Mitch Williams, both All-Stars. The starting rotation combined for a 70-49 record and only had one pitcher with a losing record (Paul Kilgus). These were The Boys Of Zimmer, a team that had a balance of young players and solid veterans, and an enthusiastic manager in Don Zimmer. </p>
<p>The 1989 squad had youth on its side with Grace, Maddux, and Walton. But Walton fell off, never matching the potential he showed in his rookie season, while Grace was consistent if not exactly a big numbers guy. Maddux churned away as the team's best starter in the early 1990s, finally earning his first Cy Young Award in 1992. Meanwhile, Sandberg and Dawson continued to be stalwarts. There was no reason to believe this wasn't the start of something that could last longer than that brief 1984 season.</p>
<p>But, like the 1984 season, the team fell short, losing to the Giants in the 1989 NLCS. And, just like after 1984, the Cubs weren't able to stay consistent and reclaim the magic. The signing of Dave Smith before the 1991 season <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-04/sports/9101200520_1_cubs-mitch-williams-dave-smith">angered Mitch Williams</a> who was shipped off to Philadelphia. And then there was the dark day in December 1992 when, within the span of a few hours, <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-10/sports/9204220435_1_cubs-greg-maddux-andre-dawson">the team shipped off both Dawson and Maddux</a>. While Dawson's career was winding down, Maddux flourished on the Braves team that went on to dominate the 1990s. </p>
<p><strong>1998: Slammin' Sammy and a rocket-armed rookie</strong><br />
Like 1984, this was a season in which there were two main stars and a solid supporting staff that lifted the Cubs to a playoff appearance and then, as brightly as it burned, faded quickly. This was, of course, the year of Sammy Sosa's run at Roger Maris' home run record and the year Kerry Wood burst on the scene thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NE7z2Ka9WUY">his 20-strikeout game on May 6</a>. While the likes of Henry Rodriguez and Kevin Tapani had career years, these players never matched the heights of '98, a year when everyone seemed to draft in the wake of Sosa's greatness (we've all seen how long that's held up over time, too). Rod Beck was also a huge part of this team with 51 saves. But it was lightning in a bottle. Despite another huge year from Sosa in 1999 (63 homers), the Cubs starting lineup the year after was ancient; the average age of the ten position players who saw action in at least 100 games was 32.8 years old. Any magic from the 1998 run was lost to the winds of age and time in the following year.</p>
<p><strong>2003: So close, yet so far</strong><br />
Sigh. What else can really be said about this other than sigh? By now, I feel like this season is hardest of all to talk about, not because of the infamous "Bartman Play" (I'm of the camp that Alou wouldn't have made the catch and his reaction made everything a million times worse and Bartman deserves no blame because, hey, Game 7!), but because of what could have been with a staff featuring Wood, Clement, and Prior. And to this day, Dusty Baker remains a bigger villain in all of this for me than Bartman for pitching those young arms far too much. I mean, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/2003.shtml">look at this lineup</a>. How did a team with Mark Grudzielanek, the corpse of Erik Karros, and Damian Miller make it so close to the World Series? This is perhaps the most painful one of all. I just can't but if you know, then you know...</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2014/12/soriano.jpg"><img data-id="10709"  src="/uploads/2014/12/soriano-284x300.jpg" alt="soriano" width="284" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10709" /></a><strong>2007-08: Sweet Lou's swan song</strong><br />
Unlike previous teams, the Cubs of 2007 and 2008 weren't built for the long haul and we all knew it. This was a team put together in the modern way: free agent signings over the years that brought in big individual pieces (Soriano, D-Lee, Lily). This was a team that had potential, sure; Zambrano, Ramirez, Fukudome, and Soto were names that got Cubs fans excited for what could happen in the future. 2008, in particular, was a big year: five position players with over 20 home runs and four starting pitchers with double-digit wins. </p>
<p>But the team was aging (only Soto, 25, and Theriot, 28 were starting position players under the age of 30) and struck out with young players who never developed as hoped (Pie, Marshall). And that's not to saying anything of a payroll that had a lot of bad, long contracts <a href="http://blog.sportscolumn.com/2008/04/01/2008-mlb-payrolls/">inflating it into the top quarter</a> of the league. There was hope with this team, yes, but at the same time, there wasn't much surprise at the team being swept out in the Divisional series in these two years. It felt more like a futile attempt to make the most of narrow, closing window by throwing money at players and hoping the individuals could coalesce into something greater, something that resembled a team that could make a run at a World Series. Instead, the team's strange polarity - inexperience on one end and aging vets on the other end - pulled things apart and that window closed.</p>
<p>(Granted, this all happened against the backdrop of the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-13/business/ct-biz-trib-series-1-20130113_1_sam-zell-randy-michaels-big-gamble">chaotic Tribune sale/bankruptcy storyline</a> which had its own negative impact on the team, at that point still part of the Tribune company until the sale to the Ricketts, the teams payroll, and the rebuilding that the franchise is just now emerging from.)</p>
<p><strong>2015: To Be Determined</strong><br />
All this isn't to say we're doomed for a repeat. If anything, the sheer amount of young talent that's been grown organically in the team's own farm system is a huge plus, the bumper crop Cubs haven't seen since, well, maybe ever. And the front office has been much more methodical in its dealings, trading players with future plans already in mind and contracts being offered to free agents that make sense (let us never forget the Debacle That Was The Milton Bradley Contract). So, yes, if there's ever a time for genuine hope for Cubs fans, it's now. You'll just have to forgive anyone who seems a bit cynical as we rev up for this new wave of talent. </p>
