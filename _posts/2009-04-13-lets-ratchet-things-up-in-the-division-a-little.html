  content: I actually enjoyed Chris Berman for once on SportsCenter this morning--as
    a teaser before a commercial he said, "Stick around to see Prince Fielder get
    his grand slam CANCELLED!"

<p>I'm not big on players fraternizing with guys on other teams.&nbsp; I know that is what baseball has become, though.&nbsp; Maybe players have always had generally good friendships with guys on other teams.&nbsp; Perhaps free agency has led to this.&nbsp; Players change teams enough that there is usually a pretty good chance they've played with, and probably become friends with, a few guys on each team.&nbsp; But I hate seeing them yuk it up at first base.&nbsp; I don't like seeing friendly exchanges.</p>
<p>Don't get my wrong, I thought the Prince Fielder/Reed Johnson exchange after Reed poked his glove over the fence and stole Fielder's first career grand-slam from him was pretty cool.&nbsp; That was mutual respect for eachother.&nbsp; But I like baseball games that feel like anything could happen at any moment.&nbsp; I like the tense feeling that I get from two teams that hate eachother.</p>
<p>I loved seeing Reed Johnson get plunked in the back by Jorge Julio last night.&nbsp; The look that Johnson gave the ump was classic.&nbsp; "Are you going to warn him or do I need to go rough him up?"&nbsp; It was obvious the plunking was on purpose, though Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were quick to say it was an accident.&nbsp; It's always been my understanding that baseball in the middle of the back is usually on purpose. If there is a guy on this roster than can handle a baseball in the back, it's Reed Johnson.</p>
<p>But that's the kind of baseball I love.&nbsp; I love watching a game that is tense and makes me feel on-edge.&nbsp; This is what an in-division rivalry should be like.&nbsp; Huge plays, a little luck and a lot of tension makes for great baseball.&nbsp; With the amount of times that division opponents face eachother in a season, I think this stuff is great.</p>
