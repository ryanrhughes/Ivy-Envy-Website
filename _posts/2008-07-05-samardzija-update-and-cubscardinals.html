  in Oklahoma City against the Rangers Triple A Affiliate.&nbsp; Samardzija earned
  a win, going over 6 innings, giving up 4 runs on 8 hits.&nbsp; He walked 3 and struck

<p>I won't brag about every Jeff Samardzija accomplishment on Ivy Envy.&nbsp; Let's be clear, my man-crush is on Matt Murton.&nbsp; But I have never owned any Cubs shirt/jersey with a name on the back and when Jeff Samardzija makes it to the Cubs and is issued a number, I will own one.&nbsp; I almost feel like I should apologize to Ryne Sandberg for saying that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jeff Samardzija took the hill in Oklahoma City against the Rangers Triple A Affiliate.&nbsp; Samardzija earned a win, going over 6 innings, giving up 4 runs on 8 hits.&nbsp; He walked 3 and struck out 6.&nbsp; He is now 2-1 with a 3.93 ERA with Iowa.&nbsp; Samardzija was gifted <a id="more"></a><a id="more-120"></a>with a lot of offense as the Iowa Cubs put up 11 runs on 19 hits.&nbsp; Oklahoma also had 3 errors in the game.&nbsp; A few names of interest had great days at the plate.&nbsp; Felix Pie went 4-5 with 1 RBI and Micah Hoffpauir went 3-4 with a HR, Double and 4 RBI's.&nbsp; A sidenote, Hoffpauir is hitting .339 in Iowa.</p>
<p>What a great weekend for baseball.&nbsp; I was relieved to see the Cubs take one in St. Louis after a long night of travel.&nbsp; It was great to see (well, hear...I was with Andy at the fireworks) Zambrano come back without missing a step.&nbsp; It's also a relief to have Reed Johnson back.&nbsp; I will also admit that I feel better with having Aramis Ramirez back in the line-up.&nbsp; There, I said it.</p>
<p>Any series against the Cardinals is important around these parts.&nbsp; I would say that we live on the northern edge of the Cubs/Cardinals geographic border in Illinois.&nbsp; I grew up 2 hours south of here and the area was dominated by Cardinals fans.&nbsp; I think there are far more Cubs fans in this area, though I work with a surprising number of Cardinals fans.&nbsp; So though we are north, and much closer to Chicago, there are some that follow the birds and the bats.&nbsp; Now that I think about it, most of the Cardinals fans I know in this area live in Iowa, so that explains it.&nbsp; They're a different kind of there.</p>
<p>I know every game is just as important/insignificant as another, but when you are playing the team right next to you in the standings, I would think it would have to be a confidence and momentum builder to take a series from them.&nbsp; Especially when you go into their brand new shiny house.</p>
<p>Go Cubs!</p>
