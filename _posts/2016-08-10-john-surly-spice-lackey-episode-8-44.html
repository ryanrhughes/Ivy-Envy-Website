On this episode, we talk about the Cubs short series with the Angels. Most of the conversation revolves around John Lackey and his great outing on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>After ignoring it for a few episodes, we decided to finally weigh in on the Tommy La Stella situation since there's actual details to the story now.  </p>
<p>We also answer a handful of listener questions and Andy shares a Rube Waddell story with us. </p>
