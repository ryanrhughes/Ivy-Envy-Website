  content: This was awesome. It was really nice seeing the Veto family

<p>Somewhere in a landfill, a mile deep by now, is a five-page manuscript detailing a tale of "The Veto Outfield" &mdash; three brothers who were signed to play one game for the Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>The paper, written by me but no doubt keyed by my mother on our Brother Electronic Typewriter, was the product of a middle school writing assignment for Mrs. Judy Daly&rsquo;s English class. Somehow I managed to get through the bulk of my education, and the bulk of my professional life, for that matter, writing about sports.</p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vetojerseya.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-9137 alignright" alt="vetojerseya" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vetojerseya-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>But the piece was sure to be a forgotten work of fiction.</p>
<p>However, thanks to my father, my brothers and I were able to live this dream for one week in Mesa, Ariz., during Randy Hundley&rsquo;s Chicago Cubs Fantasy Camp. The camp, held the last week of January at the new Cubs spring training facility, brings together dozens of ball-playing wannabees each year.</p>
<p>Some are in shape.</p>
<p>Some <em>are</em> a shape.</p>
<p>All are fairly awkward, especially compared to the men who now occupy the positions after our seven days of make-believe.</p>
<p>Corey invited me to talk about my experience <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/speaking-blessings-podcast-episode-5-49/">on a recent Ivy Envy podcast</a>. Shortly afterward, I put together a video from the footage I shot and shared it on Facebook. He then suggested my first post as an official Ivy Envy blogger be dedicated to sharing it. I promise to appear less narcissistic in the future.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em">But I do hope you enjoy it. The video is less about the camp itself and more about how baseball can permeate a family. That&rsquo;s something to which most of us can relate.</span></p>
<p>My dad is 71 (I said 72 on the podcast and he wasted no time correcting that number). Like many of your fathers, mothers, grandparents and beyond, he&rsquo;s cheered and cried over the Cubs for countless years. And his children inherited the chills and tears that come with the territory. We love the Cubs and we love baseball. So when my uncle Kenny told my dad about the fun he had with his two kids at the camp several years earlier, my dad decided he wanted to sign us up for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
<p>At the camp, we were pampered like pros. Our spikes were polished. Our jerseys were washed by the Wrigley Field clubby. And we kept the Cubs minor league trainers busy in a clubhouse that wreaked of pepperminty Ben Gay.</p>
<p>Then there was the experience of rubbing shoulders, all too literally, with pros such as Fergie Jenkins, Lee Smith and Bob Dernier. One day, Randy Hundley held court in the locker room, telling stories off the top of his head for 45 awesome minutes.</p>
<p>We played 10 games against other campers and were the first people to play a competitive game &mdash; against the old pros &mdash; at the new Cubs Park.</p>
<p>But to be on the field, in full Cubs uniform, looking left toward my brother Jim in left center, my brother Jason in right center, and my father way down the line in right, ranks easily as the most memorable part of the trip. It&rsquo;s also one of the greatest moments of my life.</p>
<p>I figure that&rsquo;s a story worth telling.</p>
