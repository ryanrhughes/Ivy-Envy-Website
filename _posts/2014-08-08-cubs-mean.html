  content: My grandmother took me to my first Cubs game 24 years ago today.  We lost
    her last February and Luke, I think we are lucky to have had some wonderful women
    (that also happened to be Cubs fans) in our lives.

  content: This is such a lovely tribute.  I'm sure your grandmother was ridiculously
    proud of you.  These are my favorite Cubs fan stories because it shows how something
    as simple as baseball can bond people together in very important relationships.  After
    2003, I stepped away from the Cubs for a few years.  But then I had a son with
    autism, who became absolutely obsessed with the Cubs and with baseball.  It reawakened
    my passion for the game and the team, and it's been the best source of bonding
    between me and him for the past 6 years.  Baseball is so much more than "just
    a game".  I'm sorry you lost your grandmother, Luke, but how wonderful you've
    had those moments with her.  There's going to be a lot of celebrating in heaven
    from a lot of Cubs fans when those boys finally win the series...God Bless...

  content: So sweet. Maybe the grandmas will have an Ivy Eny meet-up and brag on their
    caring and talented grandsons that they are watching over. Prayers for you and
    your family.

  content: I totally lost it when he said his grandma muted the TV and listened to
    Pat and Ron on the radio. My grandma did the same thing! I'll always remember
    that. My prayers are with you, Luke.

  content: Very well said Luke. Your Grandma was indeed a special lady. Always a smile
    on her face when she spoke of you and Megan. You will miss her immensely, but
    your sweet memories of her will help you through it. You have grown into a very
    nice young man and I know she is very proud of you now and always.

<p><a href="/uploads/2014/08/Luke-and-Grandma.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/08/Luke-and-Grandma-223x300.jpg" alt="Luke and Grandma" width="223" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10348" /></a>Everyone who reads this site or listens to the Ivy Envy podcast can relate to the fact that they would consider themselves die hard Cubs fans. The obvious, and somewhat over used, phrase, "The Cubs are in my DNA," can get misunderstood. For me, this phrase is perfect. This past week, my Grandmother passed away, taking her love for the Cubs with her.</p>
<p>She meant the world to me, in every sense. Aside from spoiling her grand-kids, myself and my sister, my Grandma taught me there are only a few important things in this world: family, love, and the Cubs. She did love the Bulls, but the Cubs were tops. I have gained many great personality qualities from my Grandma and being a Cubs fan is my favorite.</p>
<p>I would go over to my grandparents house&nbsp;almost every night. Naturally, the Cubs played every night so I began a routine that I continued for years after. Dinner would be served around 5:00 where our family would gather together and talk about our days. These talks usually included Cubs rumors, game recap from the day before, or just Cubs talk in general. </p>
<p>After dinner, I would watch the pregame show with my Grandpa in his room. As the game started, my Grandma would come in and watch the game. We would always turn off the TV Broadcasters and have Pat Hughes and Ron Santo describe the game to us in a way only they could. </p>
<p>My Grandma and I adored Ron and always laughed at all of the fun comments he would say. After I got cleaned up, it was time for bed, but the game wasn't over yet. So my Grandma thought of a solution; she bought me a small radio that I would put under my pillow so I could listen to the game and fall asleep.</p>
<p>Up until my Grandma's cancer took the worst toll on her, she would always send me texts during the games we couldn't watch together. They would usually say, "Awesome play Starlin," or, "Jake is doing great," and they meant the world to me. </p>
<p>I can remember one time the Cubs played the Astros in 2007 during the playoff push. I listened to the exciting end to the game, Dempster getting a 3-6-1 double play with the bases loaded to preserve the one run victory. I ran out to tell my Grandma and she was already up, watching the game and waiting for me to come out and celebrate with her. That is just who she was and how she taught me to be.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, she passed away after an 18 month battle with lung cancer. My heart was broken and all I could think about was the last words that I told her. Hours before she entered into rest, I said my final goodbye. I told her, "I love you. And tell Ronnie I said hi."</p>
<p>Every time I watch the Cubs now, I know she is sitting with me watching. All the good times, and certainly the bad times, she will be there. As I go to Wrigley for the first time today since her passing, I can't wait to see the crowd and know she is looking down on me. I'll always miss my Grandma, the reason the Cubs are one of the biggest parts of my life.</p>
