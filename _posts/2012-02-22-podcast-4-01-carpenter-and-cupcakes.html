  content: first time listener. &nbsp;i think corey has a bias so much towards samardzija
    that he made this one glaring error at worse or misstatement at best- unless he
    was talking about minor league managers and pitching coaches, he's had two pitching
    coaches and two managers in the majors. &nbsp;i'm not sure how having two managers
    and two pitching coaches (the new manager and pc in the last year so pretty much
    one manager and pc the majority of his career) explains his wild inconsistancy
    other than last year. &nbsp;his history has shown inconsistancy. &nbsp;i'm treating
    last year as the fluke.

    Well...first off, it's NEVER Jeff Samardzija's fault. &nbsp;
    Secondly...I got nothin'. &nbsp;

<p>Here it is, the first episode of the 4th season of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  Pitchers and catchers have reported to Spring Training the beat reporters are throwing non-stories at us left and right.  Samardzija is being stretched out as a starter and Carlos Marmol was throwing a cutter last year.  Also, apparently the team is so poor at fundamentals, the Cubs needed to spray paint the bases so the players knew where their feet should hit when running bases.</p>
<p>The one real piece of news is that the Theo Epstein compensation is done....kind of.  Chris Carpenter is shipping up to Boston and believe it or not, there's a guy on Twitter that wishes the Cubs could call the whole deal off.  </p>
