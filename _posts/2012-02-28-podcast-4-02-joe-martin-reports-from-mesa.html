<p>We have something different for you on this episode.  Andy and Kurt were unavailable, so Corey speaks with our eyes and ears in Mesa, Joe Martin.  Joe has jumped on board to help us with Spring Training coverage.  He talks about the overall vibe of Spring training and how things are different with a new front office.  He also speaks on the individual players and gives his opinion on what he is seeing out of the Cubs, so far in Spring Training.  </p>
<p>You can follow Joe's updates and photos from Spring Training on our Twitter account - <a href="http://twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a>.  </p>
