<p>In this episode of the podcast, we continue the discussion on renovations to Wrigley since the Cubs released more images of what the jumbotron at Wrigley will look like.  We'll give you our first impressions and talk about the points of leverage that the Cubs have in this whole situation.  </p>
<p>It wouldn't be an Ivy Envy Podcast episode in 2013 if we didn't spend a good amount of time talking about how good the starting pitching is and how bad the bullpen is.  Of course, we don't ignore the bright spots in the bullpen, Kevin Gregg and James Russell.  </p>
<p>What should the Cubs do with Carlos Marmol?  And what should the Cubs do with the rotation and bullpen with Matt Garza returns?</p>
<p>We have a scary stat of the week, an internet muscle flex of the week and an unexpected winner of this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
