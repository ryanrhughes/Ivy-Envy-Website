<p>Scott Eyre has grown on me as a player lately, but something that grows on him that will never grow on me is his facial hair.&nbsp; Pubes have no place on the face.&nbsp; However, many baseball players seem to be cultivating these audacious goatees lately.&nbsp; Kerry Wood has a healthy amount of chin music going on, and&nbsp;even Theriot has a soul patch.&nbsp; The first Cubs facial hair to make me&nbsp;nauseous <a id="more"></a><a id="more-94"></a>was Matt Clement's facial hair.&nbsp; Remember Matt Clement?&nbsp;</p>

<p>A prodigious patch like that could throw off a pitcher's mechanics!&nbsp; And so I wonder if pitchers grow these goatees for intimidation purposes rather than for aesthetic purposes.&nbsp; These guys all look a little more boyish without the growth, so perhaps the scary hair is there for a specific purpose:&nbsp;to make a batter cower in fear, take three timid swings, and skitter quickly back to the dugout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a fan of baseball, however, these nasty half-beards make me yearn for the days of the seventies relief pitcher moustache.&nbsp; Manstrength knows what I'm talking about--Rollie Fingers, Jim "Catfish" Hunter,&nbsp;Goose Gossage, et al.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if intimidation is the main objective, why not try one of the following styles--</p>

<p>The Hulihee would be a great choice as it would look effin frightening on an opposing pitcher.&nbsp; And are the "Friendly Mutton Chops" really all that friendly looking?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, here's a&nbsp;link to a <a href="http://sports.aol.com/mlb/facial-hair" target="_blank">slideshow</a> on AOL showing many of the wonderfully disturbing facial hair styles players have sported in MLB.</p>
