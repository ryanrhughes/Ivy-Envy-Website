  content: I have Baez hitting 4 home runs in Denver and 12 before the end of the
    season.  Let's not over hype him.

<p>This is our 265th episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast and I can't seem to remember us having anything as exciting to talk about as Javier Baez being called up to the Cubs. We've podcasted through some of the worst seasons in Cubs history and today felt like a solid step in the right direction.</p>
<p>We start the episode off talking about the Javier Baez promotion, what led to the promotion and what the next two months of the 2014 season may hold for Baez.</p>
<p>The trade deadline has passed and we talk about the few moves that the Cubs made after the big Samardzija/Hammel trade on July 4th.</p>
<p>We briefly touch on a few minor league players. CJ Edwards has recovered from his injury and has joined the Tennessee Smokies. Albert Almora is also with the Smokies and we talk a little about the struggles he's experienced since being promoted, and why those struggles don't have us worried.</p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions, Kurt gives us a Scary Stat of the Week and we read a bunch of internet muscle flexes.</p>
