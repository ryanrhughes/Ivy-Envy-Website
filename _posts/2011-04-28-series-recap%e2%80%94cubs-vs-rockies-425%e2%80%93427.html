<p><strong><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_25_colmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb">Monday April 25 - Rockies 5 Cubs 3</a></strong><br />
WP - Rogers (3-1)<br />
LP - Garza (0-3)<br />
SV - Street (8)</p>
<p><strong>Darwin Barney hit his first major league home run, Fukedome was 5-5 (a career high), Baker 3-4 and Garza pitched 6 innings and gave up just three hits with 7 strike outs...CUBS LOSE.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds impossible, but 4 team errors, three by Castro in the same inning, and 12 stranded will do it. The Rockies were able to squeak out 5 runs on just 4 hits while the Cubs could manage only 3 runs on 11 hits. That stat looks even worse when you consider that two of the runs were from Barney's two-run homer. The horrendous situational hitting continued. They were 0-12 with runners in scoring position in this game.</p>
<p>Poor Matt Garza. He was responsible for one of the errors, but he should have picked up a W, but instead is 0-3. I'm not sure if it's good team unity or just bad baseball cliche, but after the game it seemed like every player stepped up with an entry into the "It was my fault", "No, it's my fault" game.</p>
<p>This game recap could go on, but I'm going to cut it off there. You just need to know that the Cubs played horribly and we all need to hope this is just a fluke game that won't happen again, or at least not often. What's most upsetting is that the Cubs have broken their + or - 1 game from .500 streak and won't be 11-11 this season. Very sad.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2011_04_26_colmlb_chnmlb_1&amp;mode=wrap&amp;c_id=mlb">Tuesday April 26 - Cubs 3 Rockies&nbsp;4</a></strong><br />
WP - De La Rosa (4-0)<br />
LP - Russell (1-3)<br />
S - Street (9)</p>
<p><strong>It was clear that this would be a tough matchup for the Cubs before it ever started.</strong> They were facing Jorge De La Rosa who came in 3-0 with an ERA below 3, James Russell was up for his third fill-in start and the wind was blowing out at 12 mph. Russell did manage to go 4 innings, allowing 5 runs. I can't be too upset with Russell. He gave up three home runs on a windy night to a good offense. When he exited the Cubs were only down 2 and still in the game.</p>
<p>After giving up 2 in the first, De La Rosa settled down leaving after 7 with 9 strike outs. He shut the Cubs down on a night they should have scored a lot of runs.</p>
<p>This game was right on track with what we've seen from this team so far this season. The starting pitching could have been better and the offense just couldn't score.&nbsp;Not surprisingly, Barney and Baker&mdash;getting his 5th start at first&mdash;were both 2-4 and Castro picked up a hit and scored a run. Soriano is in mid-season bat-flip form as seen following his nearly meaningless solo shot in the 9th inning. And thankfully, the Cubs did not have any errors in this game.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday April 27 &ndash;&nbsp;<strong>Postponed until June 27</strong></strong></p>
<p>I can imagine that scheduling 162 games for 30 teams is not easy, but it seems a little odd to me the Cubs scheduled so many games at Wrigley with NL West teams in April (12 of 27 games). It rains a lot in April and scheduling make up games has to be difficult. Luckily, both the Cubs and Rockies have a scheduled day off on June 27.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-6.</strong> If you're scoring at home practice writing that. Starlin&nbsp;Castro has 7 errors.&nbsp;Milwaukee only has 7 as a team.&nbsp;The Cubs have committed 20 errors. Only Oakland, Houston and Washington have more. Not good company.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Pena really sucks.</strong> .169, 22 K. Average pitchers make him look silly. He has yet to hit a home run</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Baker does not suck.</strong> He's is hitting .409. Baker is probably not an every day first baseman, but you can't let this guy sit on the bench. In 5 games playing first Baker is hitting .412 with 2 doubles and 5 RBI. I'm just sayin'.</p>
