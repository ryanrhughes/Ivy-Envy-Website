    Since I live in Iowa, I am blacked out from&nbsp;all Midwest teams (Cubs, Twins, Brewers, White Sox, Cardinals, and Royals). I don't get local broadcasts for any of those markets and the closest geographically is Chicago at 223 miles. Kansas City is 307 miles. You know, "local". My wife and I always run to KC after dinner for some ice cream. It's a quick 10 hour round trip.
    &nbsp;
    MLB, like most businesses, usually makes decisions based on revenue. Which is why the blackouts are so baffling. They're losing revenue. I would gladly pay the $125 to subscribe to MLB.tv if it weren't for these nonsensical blackouts. I almost wonder if they're too embarrassed to admit their error and change the policy because of its blatant stupidity.

  content: I totally understand that it stinks if you don't have Mediacom or OTA.
    However, 8.3 And 26 are the only ways i can watch the white Sox, bulls, or the
    cubs in Galesburg. NBC has the Hawks sometimes. The Bears are the only ones I
    can always see.

<p>This post is specific to the Quad Cities area, which is where we are based.  Fans around the midwest have sat down to flip on a Cubs game, flipping to WGN, CSN, CSN+, MLB Network and ESPN, only to find out that the game is only broadcast on this stupid Chicago station WCIU.  Subscribing to MLB.tv or MLB Extra Innings does nothing for you because we live in the blackout region for the Cubs.  We have been complaining about WCIU since we started blogging about the Cubs in 2008.  </p>
<p>This evening, I did a segment on WQAD Channel 8.  After we were done taping, Kory Kuffler let me know that Monday's game would be broadcast on one of their digital channels.  I had planned on not being able to watch this game because it was a WCIU game.  Kory provided me with the "my 8.3" Cubs schedule.  Sure enough, every single WCIU game will be broadcast here in the Quad Cities on WQAD 8-3.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I have DirecTV, I don't get WQAD 8-3, but anyone with Mediacom will be able to get the broadcast.  According to the sheet Kory provided me, it is on Cable Channel 16.  </p>
<p>This has been a huge issue for fans in our area and I'm happy to let you know that every one of these WCIU games will be broadcast here in the Quad Cities.  Thanks to WQAD for recognizing a problem and fixing what MLB will not.  The first of these broadcasts is tomorrow evening (Monday) when Aramis Ramirez and the Brewers come to Wrigley. </p>
<p>Here is the full list of Cubs games that will be broadcast on "my 8.3" in 2012.</p>
<p>4/9 - Brewers at Cubs - 6pm<br />
5/7 - Braves at Cubs - 7pm<br />
5/14 - Cubs at Cardinals - 6pm<br />
6/13 - Tigers at Cubs - 7pm<br />
6/18 - Cubs at White Sox - 7pm<br />
6/26 - Mets at Cubs - 7pm<br />
8/20 - Cubs at Brewers - 7pm<br />
9/11 - Cubs at Astros - 7pm</p>
