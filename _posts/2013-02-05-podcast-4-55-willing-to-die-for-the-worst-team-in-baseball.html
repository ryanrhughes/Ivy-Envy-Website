<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt review the last week in Cubs baseball, and there wasn't that much to talk about.  This is our 180th episode and we are starting to put together the plans for our 200th episode.  We'll give you information on the show sometime in the next month.  By the way, what is it with Cubs fans and their love for players that are willing to die for the worst team in baseball?</p>
<p>Keith Law ranked the Cubs the #5 farm system in Major League Baseball.  We talk about what has brought on the jump from the middle of the pack to their current spot near the top.  We discuss the area that is still lacking, pitching.  Nick from Virginia wonders where the organization would be ranked if the pitching was in better shape.  Hopefully, we'll find out in a few years as the Cubs have focused on pitching.  </p>
<p>Javier Baez receives a non-roster invitation to Spring Training.  We talk about what this means...and what it doesn't mean.  Then we tell you who we are pulling for from the list of non-roster invitees.  </p>
<p>We come back from the break and Andy gives us an internet muscle flex from Cubs.com and we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  We post the photos for the caption contest on our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/google" target="_blank">Google+ page</a>.  </p>
