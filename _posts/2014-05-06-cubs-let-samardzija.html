<p><a href="/uploads/2012/07/samardzija-pitt-ii.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2012/07/samardzija-pitt-ii-300x261.jpg" alt="samardzija-pitt-ii" width="300" height="261" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7684" /></a>With every game he starts, it becomes more clear why Jeff Samardzija wants out of town. &nbsp;In 2014, Samardzija has pitched like he's on a mission, and he probably is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In his 9 innings pitched Monday night, Samardzija gave up no earned runs and only 3 hits. &nbsp;He struck out 7 and walked 2. &nbsp;He also scored on Junior Lake's sacrifice fly after leading off the 6th inning with a double. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was the only run the Cubs scored and Samardzija was dealt a no decision.<br />

<p>In his 7 starts, Samardzija is 0-3 with a 1.62 ERA.  He's allowed just 9 earned runs.  Unfortunately, the Cubs continue to give Samardzija no run support.  Here's a look at the run support the Cubs offense has provided starting pitchers:</p>
<p><strong><u>Runs Scored/27 Outs While Pitcher is in the Game</strong></u><br />
Jason Hammel - 4.8 runs<br />
Travis Wood - 4.5 runs<br />
Edwin Jackson - 4.4 runs<br />
Carlos Villanueva - 3.7 runs (includes Villanueva's relief pitching innings)<br />
Jeff Samardzija - 1.7 runs</p>
<p>I think an extension with Samardzija is extremely unlikely.  With the media, he's been pretty up-front about being prepared for a trade.  He's also made it clear that he wants to win and play on a competitive team.  It also stands to reason that he would like to be winning games when he takes the hill, which is something that isn't happening for him with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>The best positive spin to put on this situation is that Samardzija is pitching himself to a better contract and a better return when the Cubs trade him.  </p>
