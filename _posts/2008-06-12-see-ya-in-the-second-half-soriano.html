<p>It appears that Alfonso Soriano will be out another six weeks&nbsp;after breaking his hand in last night's game.&nbsp; This will be Soriano's second stint on the DL this year.&nbsp; The Cubs did well without him last time <a id="more"></a><a id="more-96"></a>and I see that happening this time as well.&nbsp; I'm not a big Soriano fan, but he's played well since he first came off the DL.&nbsp; I am a bit worried how he will return this time.&nbsp; If he shows the timidness with his hand that he's shown with his legs, expect that power to disappear for a while.&nbsp; Of course, he'll still swing those gigantic, around-the-world hacks, we'll just see a lot more pop-ups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll get to see some of Lou's creativity in the outfield and I'm guessing that we'll see lots of different combinations out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll also get to see someone who will fill the lead-off position a little better than a HR hitter.</p>
<p>I'm sorry the posts here on Ivy Envy have slowed a bit.&nbsp; I work in the schools and the end-of-year stuff have slowed me down.&nbsp; Plus I've spent about every evening building a bar in our garage/patio.&nbsp; Add that stuff to two kids under the age of 18 months and that leads to little free time like writing about the Cubs.&nbsp;</p>
