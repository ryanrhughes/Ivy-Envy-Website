<p>After weeks of speculation on Masahiro Tanaka, we comment on the Cubs not landing him and we try to look at the silver lining of the situation.  We also know another pitcher that will not be playing for the Cubs in 2014, Scott Baker.  </p>
<p>We are only a few weeks from Cubs players reporting to Arizona for Spring Training.  Prospect lists are starting to come out.  <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/prospects/watch/y2014/" target="_blank">MLB.com released their Top 100 prospects</a>, which includes seven players from the Cubs organization.  Jason Parks also released his <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=22641" target="_blank">top 10 prospects for the Cubs system</a>.  </p>
<p>We talk about this a little and it launches us into an interview Corey did with John Arguello from <a href="http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-den/" target="_blank">Cubs Den</a>.  There's a little Tanaka talk and a lot of prospect talk, with a dash of Starlin Castro at the end.  John shares his thoughts on the top prospects in the Cubs system, including who is most likely to succeed and who, of the top 4 prospects might be the one to struggle.  You can find John:<br />
