<p>Most Cubs fans are familiar with the term: <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em>.&nbsp; The <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em> is the theory developed in 1981 by Ron Berler that any team with three or more ex-Cubs is doomed for failure heading into a World Series.&nbsp; The 2001 Diamondbacks broke the "curse" and in 2008, both the Phillies and Rays entered the World Series with three ex-Cubs.</p>
<p>I define the <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em> differently.&nbsp; To me, the <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em> is the idea that players seem to succeed after they leave the Cubs.&nbsp; I have no stats to back this and when I tried to think of examples of post-Cubs success, I decided that it isn't so much that the players have more success after leaving the Cubs, it's just that they seem to be the players that step up in games against the Cubs.&nbsp; But for the sake of discussion here, let's define The <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em> as a player succeeding after leaving the Cubs.</p>
<p>A Cubs fan couldn't look at the Spring Training games recaps from around MLB without feeling a quick little stab of the <em>ex-Cubs Factor</em> in their stomachs.&nbsp; A name that will go down in history as one of the biggest failures in franchise history made his first real step towards a comeback.</p>

<p>Mark Prior was picked up by the Yankees in the off-season and appeared in his first MLB game (we'll count it, even though it's exhibition) since 2006.&nbsp; He has been re-united with Larry Rothschild.&nbsp; Prior showed nothing but potential in 2003.&nbsp; The future looked amazingly bright for both the 22 year old Prior and the Cubs.&nbsp; In 2003, Prior went 18-6 with a 2.43 ERA.&nbsp; Then, the injury bug struck and Prior <del datetime="2011-03-01T01:18:14+00:00">was</del> may never be the same.</p>
<p>So you're thinking "Mark Prior sneaked into a Spring Training game, big deal", right?&nbsp; Sure...but let me read his pitching line for you today.&nbsp; He pitched one full inning without giving up a run or hit.&nbsp; He registered a strikeout.&nbsp; Prior threw 5 pitches - 5 strikes.</p>
<p>Is the ex-Cubs dagger a little deeper?&nbsp; It probably shouldn't be.&nbsp; I don't expect Prior to mount some great comeback.&nbsp; His pitches barely hit 90mph and he will never start.&nbsp; In fact, the deal he signed is a minor league contract.&nbsp; He will have to go to AAA to show that he can pitch well and stay healthy.&nbsp; So don't get too worried, Cubs fans.&nbsp; Don't get all excited and put a Wood vs. Prior match-up at Wrigley Field in June when the Yankees come to town.</p>
<p>Today was just a blip in the current career of Mark Prior.&nbsp; But it's the pessimism in us as Cubs fans that allows our stomachs not not just accept the ex-Cubs dagger, but maybe even pull it in a little deeper.</p>
