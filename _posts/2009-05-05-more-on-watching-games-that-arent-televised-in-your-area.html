  content: "What you posted last night worked great for me on a Mac using Safari.
    It was super smooth and the full screen picture was really good. The only thing
    I didn't like is that it jumped from widescreen to normal quite a bit. \r\n\r\nAs
    I was watching I couldn't help but think \"this can't be legal\". Is the FCC going
    to shut us down for piracy?"

  content: "I think that site has been running for a few years.  You would think if
    it was illegal, MLB would have shut them down by now.\r\n\r\nThat said, I can't
    imagine that it is legal."

<p>If you missed it, I let everyone know <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=759">how to watch the WCIU game last night</a>.  Let me know how it worked for you.  I'm just curious.  It was pretty choppy on my end.  Though when it ran smoothly, it was a great picture.  I also read that it runs better on Internet Explorer rather than Firefox.  I didn't notice a great difference between the two.</p>
<p>I wanted to share how I found this so that you can watch any game that you aren't able to get through your television.&nbsp; Hopefully this will help you watch any Cubs game you'd like.&nbsp; This could also be very useful for those afternoon games where you're stuck at work.</p>
<p>First, you'll want to download TVAnts.  You can do that here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myp2p.eu/softwareitem.php?softwareid=4&amp;part=software">http://www.myp2p.eu/softwareitem.php?softwareid=4?=software</a></p>
<p>Then, go to this site:  <a href="http://www.myp2pforum.eu/mlb-baseball/">http://www.myp2pforum.eu/mlb-baseball/</a></p>
<p>In that forum, find the thread for the current day.  For instance, today's thread reads:</p>
<p><strong>Baseball Today | Tuesday May 5th [Streaming]</strong></p>
<p>(You will want the Streaming, not the discussion)</p>
<p>In that thread, you will be looking for a link next to the game you'd like to watch.  Sometimes links don't show up until right before game-time.  You can also go down through the thread and someone may have posted links down there.</p>
<p>I just discovered this yesterday and I've just told you all that I know.  Let me know how it works for you.</p>
