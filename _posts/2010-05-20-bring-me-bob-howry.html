  content: "My main concern is that I could take 10 Polaroid pictures, shake them
    like they are Polaroid pictures, and allow them to develop completely between
    each Howry pitch. \r\n\r\nI do think you guys are right about looking at the entire
    span of Howry's career, but I also think that you have to put a little more weight
    on recent struggles rather than stats that are 3-4 seasons old.  But you are right,
    the Cubs might as well roll the dice and see what they get."

  content: I see what you're saying about recent struggles, Andy.  However, he's only
    pitched 14 innings this year.  Look at the players in baseball (and on the Cubs)
    that have gotten off to slow starts.  He pitched decent enough in San Fran last
    year to indicate that he still has something left.

  content: The only thing is, 14 innings as a reliever -- espescially in the 6th-7th
    inning role -- is between 7 and 14 appearances. With a 16.00 ERA, that's between
    7 and 14 games that you now lose, or at least make too interesting.

  content: "Concerning Howry's rough first 14 innings, we need to remember he's had
    an incredibly unclucky 45% LOB. Left on base (LOB) is a great stat for pitchers'
    luck. League average is around 70%, anything lower is unlucky.\r\n\r\nI like the
    signing; I think it's a clear case of low cost, high reward."

  content: "First of all the caption of this article is funny.\r\n\r\nSecond, Veto's
    point is very correct.  The math alone makes any team that guy pitches for a losing
    team almost all of the time.\r\n\r\nIt isn't that unusual for a middle reliever
    to have a substantial ERA, but 16 is a tad bit higher than just being \"substantial\"

<p>I've had to endure two days of Cubs fans freaking out over the idea of Bob Howry wearing a Cubs uniform again.&nbsp; I collected all my thoughts and sat down to write a post.&nbsp; I wanted to talk about how Bob Howry isn't as bad as we remember.&nbsp; I wanted to talk about how horrible our bullpen is and how there aren't a lot of options right now.&nbsp; Then I clicked on my Google Reader and read <a href="http://www.anothercubsblog.net/2010-articles/may/cubs-to-sign-bob-howry.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on AnotherCubsBlog.net.&nbsp; <br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spot Freaking On</strong></span>.<strong></strong></p>
<p>In the last few days, I've posted some on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a> in favor of the move.&nbsp; When it comes to relief pitchers, we remember the worst and forget about the rest.&nbsp; The blown late innings games stand out the most.  I remember 2008 Bob Howry.&nbsp; Up to this point, 2010 Bob Howry has been even worse than 2008 Bob Howry.&nbsp; But I don't know what goes on behind the scenes.&nbsp; Perhaps Bobby needs a new situation.&nbsp; The Arizona bullpen (even worse than ours) is enough to make anyone desire some new scenery.</p>
<p>So let's look past 2008 Bob Howry.&nbsp; I know it's a difficult thing to do.  But, 2006 and 2007 Bob Howry were pretty efficient out of the bullpen.  His ERA was 3.17 and 3.32, respectively.  He also had a nearly 4-1 strikeout to walk ratio.  After the horrendous 2009 season that gives us chills, Howry had a decent season last year with the Giants.  He didn't appear in as many games, but got his ERA back down to 3.39.  He walked a few more guys and his K to BB ratio was at 2-1.  Now, 2010 Bob Howry has just been horrendous. He's got an ERA over 10 and no redeeming statistic that I could find in my 18 seconds of research.</p>
<p>But relief pitchers are streaky.  What do the Cubs have to lose?  If he sucks, they cut him loose. There aren't many options out there this early in the season.  Maybe he'll settle in and go all 2010 Carlos Silva on our asses.  I'd rather the Cubs buy some disposable veteran that has had a decent career rather than pull up some youngsters from the farm system and ruin them by throwing them to the wolves.  Put it on the record, I am in favor of the Bob Howry experiment.  </p>
