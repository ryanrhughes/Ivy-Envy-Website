<p>This Cubs team is such a disappointment.&nbsp; I honestly can't identify any point in this season where I figured the playoffs were a lock, except during Spring Training.&nbsp; In his presser after yesterday's game, Lou indicated there might be changes coming to the line-up.&nbsp; Really?!&nbsp; I would think that would be something you do BEFORE you do something like fire the hitting coach.&nbsp; Speaking of which, I don't see how you can pin this offense on the hitting coach, but I honestly don't know the ins and outs of Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Soriano - First off, maybe Cubs.com can hold off on begging me to vote for Soriano for the All-Star game until he plays like an All-Star.&nbsp; Do they make a real case for him to be in the game?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; "Soriano needs your votes to keep streak alive".&nbsp; I don't know where to start with Soriano.&nbsp; Right now, he's a liability at the plate and in the field.&nbsp; He has no business batting in the lead-off spot.&nbsp; I don't care if he can put you up 1-0 in his first at-bat.&nbsp; He's batting .225 and his OBP is under .300.&nbsp; If he is hot and hitting homeruns, he should be able to do it no matter where he is in the line-up and I'd rather have a guy or two on base as opposed to the bases empty.&nbsp; If you look at the guys that are in the top 50 in HR's hit this season, which Soriano is a part of, only 1 of them has fewer RBI's than Soriano.&nbsp; It's because the bases are empty when he hits homeruns and he makes no real effort to drive in a run because he'd rather put one over the wall.&nbsp; His loafing in Left Field yesterday, allowing Dewayne Wise to tag up and score was ridiculous.&nbsp; Andy and I were watching the game at Twenty and we couldn't name another outfielder on the team that would make such a stupid play.&nbsp; He ran with the ball, slapped the pocket of his glove a few times and then threw the ball.&nbsp; It was a pretty close play at the plate, so I can only assume if he would have gotten it in as quickly as Fukudome would have, Wise would have been out by a mile.&nbsp; Of course, I'm sure the White Sox had done enough scouting to know that it would be a good idea to run on Soriano there.&nbsp; The talk is moving Soriano to second base and down in the order.&nbsp; I could handle Soriano at second base if that means getting Aaron Miles out of there.&nbsp; That move could get Jake Fox or Fukudome in the lineup and those are much better options than running Miles out there.&nbsp; I have no loyalty to Soriano.&nbsp; I can handle guys that don't perform as long as they are giving it effort.&nbsp; That's why I'm able to give Milton Bradley some slack.&nbsp; He looks like he's trying, to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; If Lou drops Soriano in the order, I'd like to see it last about 2 weeks.&nbsp; There's no point in dropping him for 2 or 3 games.&nbsp; I say drop him until he starts hitting the ball and make him earn his way back to the lead-off spot.</p>
<p>Soto - Time to sit again, young man.&nbsp; I don't think Koyie Hill is going to save this offense, but Soto is not playing like a leader.&nbsp; He had the chance to drive in runs yesterday and he's out there swinging for the fences.&nbsp; He does not look like he's trying to drive the ball or advance runners at all.&nbsp; Plus, he just looks out of shape.&nbsp; It really looks like he's added about 15 pounds this year.&nbsp; Rookie of the Year or not, he needs to change his mindset at the plate.&nbsp; I don't think it's a good idea to bench guys who aren't hitting, but I do think it's a good idea to bench guys that have a bad approach at the plate.&nbsp; While we were watching the game, Andy pointed out that his ability to throw out guys stealing has seemed to drop off lately.&nbsp; I don't have the stats to back that up, but it sure does seem like people are running on him pretty well.</p>
<p>I'm very interested to see what today's lineup looks like.</p>
