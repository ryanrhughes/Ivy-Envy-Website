<p>Andy, Corey and Jeremy are able to discuss a topic that many Cubs fans have been waiting for a long time - Wrigley Field is being renovated.  </p>
<p>Cubs Caravan traveled to Peoria last Wednesday.  Corey and Jeremy were there and Corey tells you why he thinks Cubs Caravan may not return to Peoria.  Jeremy made the trip to Chicago for Cubs Convention and compares this year with previous Cubs Conventions.  </p>
<p>As mentioned, the biggest news out of Cubs Convention this year was the announcement and details of the renovation of Wrigley Field.  Andy describes all the Wrigley Field renovations, we read some listener feedback on the renovation and then we tell you what we think about it.  </p>
<p>Corey had the opportunity to speak with Cubs hitting coach, James Rowson at the Cubs Caravan event in Peoria.  Listen to Rowson's take on Soriano's surprise 2012 season and the struggles of Brett Jackson.  We also hear what Rowson thinks about the guys in the minor league system.  </p>
<p>In Kurt's absence, Andy steps up with the lone Cubs.com Internet Muscle Flex of the Week.  We have started a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/103765810968218526240" target="_blank">Google+ Community</a> and we'll now be posting our photos for the caption contests over there, as well as on Facebook.  </p>
