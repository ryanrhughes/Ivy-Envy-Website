<p>While the Cubs roster is riddled with Iowa players, 1/3 of a starting roster of Cubs players was with Iowa, rehabbing their injuries.  Jeff Baker, Reed Johnson and Alfonso Soriano all made appearances in Des Moines in the last few days.  </p>
<p><strong>Jeff Baker</strong><br />
Baker looks to return with the Cubs today, coming off a groin injury.  He had played very well up to his injury and hopefully he can pick up where he left off.  In 31 games with the Cubs, he's batting .362, which is 90 points above his career average.  Baker got in three games with Iowa, going 3-10, with a double and a triple.  The triple is a good sign that his groin is back to normal.  Expect DJ LeMahieu to be sent back to Iowa when Baker returns to the Cubs.  LeMahieu went 1-9 at the plate, with a start at 3rd base and some pinch-hitting opportunities.  If that's how they planned to use him, I'm surprised they didn't bring up Bobby Scales instead, who is batting .417 in pinch-hitting opportunities with the Cubs.  </p>
<p><strong>Reed Johnson</strong><br />
Reed Johnson went to the DL with a back injury and was in Des Moines for his rehab for the same games as Jeff Baker.  Johnson's rehab didn't go as well, though.  After going a combined 0-5 with 3 strikeouts in Thursday's and Friday's games, Johnson was hit in the head by a pitch in the fifth inning of Saturday's game.  He was taken to the hospital, but it sounds like he just had some cuts and his helmet absorbed most of the impact.  The last reports were that Johnson will return to the Cubs today, but don't expect to see him playing right away.</p>
<p><strong>Alfonso Soriano</strong><br />
Soriano went to the DL with a pulled muscle in his left leg.  He started his rehab stint with Iowa on Sunday and played five innings.  He got three at-bats and went 0-3.  I was able to watch his first at-bat via MiLB.tv.  He grounded out to the 2nd baseman, but actually appeared to hustle down the line and made the play close when the 2nd baseman fumbled with the routine ground-ball.  After the game, Soriano said that his leg feels good and is about 90%, but that he's now at the "mental" part of the process and admitted that the injury is in his head.  It seems like Soriano struggles with this aspect of injuries more than other players.  </p>
<p>The Iowa Cubs travel to Omaha for a series with the Stormchasers, so that club will benefit from the revenue of a MLB star playing in the games.  From an organizational standpoint, I think it would have benefitted the Peoria Chiefs quite a bit to host Soriano.  The Chiefs would have been home during the entire Soriano rehab stint.  Why not keep the added ticket sales and hype within the organization?  Soriano will play seven innings tonight and nine innings tomorrow night.  Tyler Colvin was brought back up to the Cubs when Soriano went to the DL and it'll be interesting to see who gets sent back to Iowa.  Tony Campana's speed has been useful and Colvin is batting .091 (3-33), with a double since coming back up to the Cubs.  </p>
