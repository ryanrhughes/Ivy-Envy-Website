<p>Welcome to the last episode of our sixth season of podcasting on the Cubs, which is our 296<sup>th</sup> episode.  If you are looking for our usual Cubs talk, you won't find much of it on this episode.  The three of us have the opportunity to record in the same room about twice a year, so you'll have to excuse the "hangout" vibe this episode has.  </p>
<p>Michael from Galesburg (and <a href="http://theawesome80s.com" target="_blank">The Awesome 80's Podcast</a>) joins us and earns the title of the official Ivy Envy Regular Guest. Thanks to Rory from San Francisco for providing the delicious Pliny the Elder.  </p>
<p>If you'd like to hear the first baseball card episode we recorded, all the way back in 2009 (our 1st season of podcasting), you can listen to it here:  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-26-baseball-cards/" target="_blank">Podcast #26 - Baseball Cards</a>.  We were very excited to pull out the 1980s baseball cards from our childhoods.  In the episode, we do a contest of sorts, determining who has the best card in specific categories such as:  Most fitting and ill-fitting names, best hair, ugliest, best card from a Cubs rival team, best card with a non-baseball item in the photo, etc.  </p>
<p>Prior to the recording of this episode, we got this tweet.<br />
