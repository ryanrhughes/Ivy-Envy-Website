<p>The Cubs have rolled off a 4-game winning streak and with their offensive explosion on Tuesday night against the Angels, have now only lost 2 of their last 8 series.  The Cubs are being powered by Alfonso Soriano.  In his last 11 games, Soriano is hitting .400 with 8 HR and 17 RBIs.  I don't know if teams would bite on Soriano, but he's sure not hurting himself.  But in a backward way, is he hurting the Cubs?</p>
<p>The Cubs are clearly not going to contend for a playoff spot in 2013.  The NL Central is currently the best division in baseball.  The top three teams in the division would be in the playoffs if they started today.  The Cubs are 14 games out of 1st place and 9 games behind the 3rd place Reds.  While we're just coming up on the All-Star Break and it's not impossible to make up a 9 game deficit, as an organization, the Cubs are not in the right position to make the roster moves to make a push.  In fact, the Cubs are in the opposite position.</p>
<p>The Cubs are in sell-off mode.  A number of players have already been moved and with the trade deadline almost 3 weeks away, more players will be traded away.  Matt Garza, Kevin Gregg and maybe even Soriano could be sent to other teams for prospects.  If a player does not benefit this team in 3-5 years, the front office has no interest in keeping them around.  The Cubs would like a team that is competitive in the long-term, year in and year out.  Buying short-term pieces at the trade deadline that will hurt the long-term success is not an option, regardless of a 4-game winning streak a week before the All Star Break.  </p>
<p>One of the main ways the Cubs are building up their system in preparation of sustained long-term success is the draft.  Baseball America recently released their <a href="http://www.baseballamerica.com/minors/midseason-prospect-update-top-50-prospects/" target="_blank">updated Top 50 Prospects List</a>.  The Cubs had a pretty lackluster farm system just a few years ago.  Now, the Cubs have 3 prospects in the top 20 of Baseball America's list.  Two of those prospects, Javier Baez (#10) and Albert Almora (#16) were the Cubs' first round picks in the 2011 and 2012 drafts.  The other prospect in the top 20 is Jorge Soler (#18), who was an international free agent.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have sacrificed, and continue to sacrifice the short term for the long term.  The Cubs are now 8 games under .500 and if the season ended today, they would have the #10 draft pick in the 2014 draft.  It's hard to believe there are 9 teams worse than the Cubs, including defending World Series champions, San Francisco Giants.  I am not saying the front office is going to sabotage the 2013 Cubs to ensure a better draft pick, but the moves they will be making will have that result.  </p>
<p>I would never root for the Cubs to lose, although I would love to see them get one more top 3 draft pick.  Instead, with the 2013 Cubs, I will cheer when the win and shrug off losses, knowing that it will help the Cubs down the road.  </p>
