<p>I sat at work today, occasionally looking at the score of today's Cubs vs. Rockies game.&nbsp; After a 4 run deficit in the 1st inning and a&nbsp;8 run deficit by the middle of the 4th inning, I had all but written off this game.&nbsp; At least we can take care of them tomorrow&nbsp;and salvage the series...right?&nbsp; Well, by the 7th inning, <a id="more"></a><a id="more-89"></a>I had given up on checking on the game on MLB.com and turned on my radio that doesn't get very good reception in my office.&nbsp; But a fuzzy Ron Santo is better than tardy update from MLB.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I enjoyed tracking this comeback with my co-worker that is a Cardinals fan.&nbsp; Edmonds playing a huge role in this comeback made it more entertaining for me.&nbsp; So, I think this is the game that will be referenced throughout the year.&nbsp; Not so much in that it will be "the game where the season turned around", but rather an example of this team's ability to put up a lot of runs and their ability to come back from behind.&nbsp; We have seen throughout April and May that this is a team that you can't count out at any point in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've deemed this game "The Best Game I Never Saw".&nbsp; It is a game that would have been a blast to watch on tv.&nbsp; Maybe Comcast will show a rerun tonight or tomorrow and it will become "The Best Game I Never Saw Live".</p>
<p>Two side-comments:</p>
<p>*Can we just play all our games at home?</p>
<p>*Lilly's poor performance can't be lost in the mix of this great win.&nbsp; Our starting pitching still scares me.</p>
