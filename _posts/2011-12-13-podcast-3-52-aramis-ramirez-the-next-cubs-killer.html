<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt talk about meeting Pat Hughes, radio voice of the Chicago Cubs over the weekend at a book signing for "Ron Santo: A Perfect 10", in the Quad Cities.  While on the topic of Ron Santo, we read an email from Michael in Galesburg, IL.  </p>
<p>We discussed the possibility that with his signing with the Milwaukee Brewers, Aramis Ramirez could become the next in a long-line of Cubs-killers.  We also touch on the idea that Ramirez could be forced to carry the power for the Brewers for the first 50 games of the Brewers season with due to Ryan Braun and his "highly unusual circumstances".  </p>
<p>Ian Stewart will be the replacement at 3rd base for Ramirez and we take a look at the trade that brought him to the Cubs and Tyler Colvin and DJ LeMahieu to the Rockies.  Speaking of players we are ok with seeing leave the Cubs (Colvin), we bid farewell to Koyie Hill.  With his departure, we talk about the replacement, and future of the Cubs at the catcher position.</p>
<p>After the photo caption contest, Corey reads some interesting tidbits on baseball players from the late 80's and early 90's from the website <a href="http://dee-nee.com/rbi/hallofshame.shtml" target="_blank">RBI Hall of Shame</a>.  </p>
