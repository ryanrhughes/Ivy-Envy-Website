We recorded this episode during the Cubs series finale with the Brewers in Milwaukee, but didn't spend a ton of time on the series, outside of some Hammel and Hendricks talk.  </p>
<p>We check in on the magic number and start thinking playoffs.  One reason to start thinking about the playoffs is the Cubs' post-season lottery, which has opened up.  </p>
<p>We end the episode with some Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
