<p>When the Chicago Cubs decided to end their affiliation with the Peoria Chiefs, many in Central Illinois wondered if this meant the end of the Cubs Caravan making it's way down every January.  For whatever reason, a lot of fans in the area took it as the Cubs writing off Central Illinois and handing it over to the Cardinals, who became the parent ball club  for the Peoria Chiefs.  </p>
<p>On Wednesday January 16th, Cubs Caravan will roll into Peoria as part of it's 2-day tour around parts of Illinois and Northwest Indiana.  If you have never attended a Cubs Caravan event, it is a nice event to start preparing for the upcoming season.  The caravan typically has 10-12 current and former players and coaches, as well as other individuals associated with the Cubs.  </p>
<p>I went last year and enjoyed myself quite a bit.  There is a time for autographs at the beginning of the event.  I believe everyone was guaranteed the opportunity to meet and get the autographs of at least two players and coaches.  After that, the emcee (last year it was Dave Otto) asks the panel some questions.  Then, they turn the mics over to the audience for questions.  </p>
<p>Last year, I had the opportunity to speak with a few of the players, including a short interview with Matt Sczcur, who was the #4 ranked prospect in the Cubs organization at the time.  You can listen to that interview here - <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-06-bonus-interview-episodematt-szczur/" target="_blank">Ivy Envy Podcast Episode 4.06 - Matt Szczur interview</a>.  </p>
<p>I am not sure how the 2013 will differ from years past because I don't believe the Peoria Chiefs will be part of the Cubs Caravan event.  I know they orchestrated a lot of the day.  They were also able to keep the audience Q&amp;A session under control and if they aren't there to do that, that portion of the evening could be awful/incredible.  Imagine Cubs fans of all ages handed a microphone in what they believe is their moment to share ideas and opinions on the organization.  </p>
<p>Cubs Caravan is a great event for kids.  They will have the opportunity to talk to and take pictures with the players.  The cost is only $15 and that includes the usual ballpark food.  </p>
