<p>We discuss Milton Bradley and talk about the Cubs minor league system in an interview with Matt from Wrigley Bound.&nbsp; You'll have to excuse some of the background noise.&nbsp; Our neighbors were having a new roof put on their house.&nbsp; That noise proves that yes, we actually do record outside.</p>
<p>Those present:&nbsp; Corey, Andy, Kurt and Brian</p>
