  content: Still can't get over that Olt didn't make the list at all. I can think
    of two that should have made the list but oh well.

  content: Well, I think if you assume he will recover from his eye issues and everything,
    yeah...you'd include him.  But I can see why he's not on the list.

<p>MLBPipleine.com revealed their <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/prospects/watch/y2014/" target="_blank">Top 100 Prospects</a>&nbsp;Thursday night on the MLB Network. &nbsp;As expected, the Cubs organization had a strong presence in the list.  There were seven Cubs prospects in the Top 100.  That ranks the Cubs 2nd, only to the Red Sox in the total number of prospects listed.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Javier-Baez.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Javier-Baez-150x150.jpg" alt="Javier Baez Cubs Prospect" width="150" height="150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8717" /></a>Here are the rankings of Cubs players in this list:</p>
<p>7.   Javier Baez<br />
9.   Kris Bryant<br />
18.  Albert Almora<br />
42.  C.J. Edwards<br />
49.  Jorge Soler<br />
89.  Arismendy Alcantara<br />
100. Pierce Johnson</p>
<p>Prospect lists and organizational rankings have been trickling in and it's nothing but encouraging news for Cubs fans.  2014 will be a really interesting season, though.  As these prospects move up to the highest levels of the minor leagues, we will have a better idea of where they are in their development.  </p>
