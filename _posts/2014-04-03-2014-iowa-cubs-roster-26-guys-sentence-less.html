<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/iowacubs-300x272.png" alt="Iowa Cubs Logo" width="300" height="272" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9092" /></a><a href="http://minorleaguereport.com" target="_blank">The Minor League Report</a> recently dubbed the Iowa Cubs the most exciting MiLB team for 2014. Here is a look at the roster.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pitchers:</strong></u><br />
For reliever <b>Casey Coleman</b>, the alliteration could continue if he gets another cup of coffee with the Cubs this year.</p>
<p>Hawaiian <b>Marcus Hatley</b> has the stuff to say &lsquo;aloha&rsquo; to the Bigs this year, but first needs to say &lsquo;aloha&rsquo; to the high walk rate.</p>
<p>The rotation in Des Moines will be anchored by the 2013 Cubs Minor League Pitcher of the Year,<b> Kyle Hendricks</b>- at least until Renteria needs him in Chicago.</p>
<p>Relying more on command than pure stuff, <b>Eric Jokisch</b> will be a nice piece as a starter in Iowa after logging 265 double-A innings over the last two campaigns, but his future role is less definitive.</p>
<p><b>Marcos Mateo</b> has returned in more ways than one, having been returned from his Rule 5 suitors in Arizona and also bouncing back from injury; does the 30 year old have enough left to get back to The Show?</p>
<p>Back from last year&rsquo;s squad is <b>Yoanner Negrin</b>, a fringe-type starter with a less than stellar WHIP/ERA combo last year, but he did strike out 118 in 108 innings.</p>
<p>As recently as a week ago, <b>Blake Parker</b> seemed a good bet to stick in the Big League bullpen with hopes of replicating an awesome (1.165 WHIP, 10.7 K/9) 2013 performance on the Northside.</p>
<p>Joining the I-Cubs&rsquo; Hurlers with Hardware Club is reigning Dominican Winter League Pitcher of the Year, <b>Carlos Pimentel</b>- another former Rangers prospect, but one not acquired via trade.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know about <b>Neil Ramirez</b>, here is some suggested reading by a smart, handsome writer: <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/theo-thievery-breaking-matt-garza-trade/" target="_blank">On Theo and Thievery: Breaking Down the Matt Garza Trade</a></p>
<p>Another reliever, <br>Zac Rosscup</b> is a talented lefty that has impact potential at the Major League level and likely isn&rsquo;t long for Iowa.</p>
<p><b>Chris Rusin </b>was part of the competition for the 5<sup>th</sup> and final rotation spot in Chicago but will hone his craft in the PCL until he is needed as an emergency starter or fill-in.</p>
<p><b>Jonathan Sanchez</b> is 31 years old, once threw a no-hitter for the Giants, and is now trying to get back to the MLB, likely in the form of a LOOGY, which is a fun baseball term you can use to impress co-workers when you google it after this article finishes.</p>
<p>The Cubs released <b>Tsuyoshi Wada</b> and then resigned him, seemingly in a matter of minutes, to serve as organizational depth.</p>
<p><strong><u>Position Players:</strong></u></p>
<p><b>Luis Flores</b> returns to Iowa after hitting just .204 last year in a limited role as back up catcher.</p>
<p><b>Eli Whiteside</b> lost the Cubs reserve catching gig to Jeff Baker but will hang on with Iowa in case his services are needed in Chicago at some point.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking forward to seeing <b>Arismendy Alcantara</b> play in person since his Futures Game homer and tomorrow I will finally get to see the speedy switch-hitter in action.</p>
<p>Once a Top 100 prospect <b>Lars Anderson </b>is a first baseman with some power who is looking to prove he is still has big league talent, even if it comes in the form of a bat off the bench.</p>
<p>The gushing over <b>Javier Baez</b> has been plentiful and it is all warranted; the guys is an absolute monster in the making and his prolific power has me planning on parking no where near Principal Park until Javy is safely entrenched at Wrigley for the next 15 glorious years.</p>
<p>Following Javy&rsquo;s blurb was always going to be a tough task, it is especially tough for DL bound <b>Edgar Gonzalez.</b></p>
<p><b></b><b>Chris Valaika</b> is a utility infielder who is unlikely to have much of an impact in Iowa, let alone Chicago, but the good news for Chris is he&rsquo;s no longer a Miami Marlin.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/eye-cubs/" target="_blank">boasted about the talent-laden Iowa infield</a> already but I can&rsquo;t say enough about the oft under-appreciated and highly talented <b>Christian Villanueva.</b></p>
<p>Already on the 40-man roster, potential super-utility man <b>Logan Watkins</b> is going to get playing time all over the diamond in Des Moines and sooner than later be serving a Mark DeRosa type role in Chicago.</p>
<p><b>Chris Coghlan</b> is not going to be high on the pecking order for playing time in the Iowa outfield with three prospects on the 40-man slated ahead of him, and may not be a Cub long if the opportunity for playing time arises in another organization.</p>
<p>A phenomenal athlete with 20 homer, 20 steal potential <b>Brett Jackson</b> is probably getting his last chance this season to show the Cubs that he can overcome the contact issues that have haunted his professional career and become a major league contributor.</p>
<p>A two-sport athlete at Villanova, <b>Matt Szczur</b> is another exceptional athlete to roam the outfield at Principal Park and is on the brink of an important campaign with talented outfield prospects like Albert Almora and Jorge Soler nipping at his heels.</p>
<p>Former number 3 overall pick <b>Josh Vitters</b> has converted from 3B to OF but has maintained his sweet swing all along and will have his sights set on earning another shot in Chicago this season.</p>
<p>There you have it, the most exciting roster in Minor League Baseball.</p>
