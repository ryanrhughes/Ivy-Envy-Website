  content: "I would tend to agree with this blog.  I felt like there were only so
    many things that we could discuss about the Cubs yesterday.\r\n\r\nAnd of course
    Lilly loses the no hitter in the 9th inning.  Both pitchers had a no hitter going
    into the 7th inning but really how much of that is actually impressive and not
    just showing how pathetic those two offenses are?  I'm sorry but if you got two
    teams not hitting anything, you've got the makings of a very BORING baseball game.\r\n\r\nBack
    to the disinterest in the Cubs:  The Cubs appear to be disppaearing off of the
    sports map.  I wouldn't be shocked if they lost 90+ games this year, and would
    be even less shocked if they fire Lou before the All star break.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>In the last week or 10 days, I have nearly lost all interest in the Cubs.  On Friday, Andy and I spent the afternoon at a bar in LeClaire, IA to watch the Cubs/Sox game and a World Cup match.  I have little interest in soccer, though I do dabble in it during the World Cup.  My interest in the Cubs game was so low, my back was to the tv with that game on and I rarely turned around to check on the game.  Andy's facial expressions in response to the Cubs game was all I needed.  The France/Uruguay game was a <b>riveting</b> 90 minutes of 0-0 soccer, so it's easy to understand why I chose to watch that over another awful Randy Wells outing.  At this point, I feel like I might get to see more scoring in World Cup games than watching the Cubs offense.</p></p>
<p>You would think that an incredible game and outing&nbsp; on Sunday evening by Ted Lilly (perhaps one of his last in a Cubs uniform) would capture my interest - and it did.  But it left me angry.  Angry at the offense to continuing to provide no support for the starting pitching.  It left me angry at Lou Piniella for pulling Ted after giving up one hit.  It left me angry at Carlos Marmol for not coming in and locking that game down immediately.  If the Cubs were going to win me over and bring me back in, Marmol walking batters and forgetting to throw the ball to home-plate was not going to do it.</p></p>
<p>I keep telling myself "If they can just go on a good run, they'll draw me back in."  I think this White Sox series was their last chance.  This team isn't going to get interesting.&nbsp; This is a team that has lost 5 straight series, 4 of which were against teams within the NL Central and 3 of which were against the bottom 3 teams in the division.&nbsp; Those teams (Brewers, Astros, Pirates) are a combined 33 games under .500.&nbsp; I know we'd all like to put the Cubs vs. Pirates stuff behind us, but the Pirates are still <b>bad</b>.&nbsp; The 2010 season is nearly 40% completed and the Cubs are responsible for about 1/3 of the Pirates' victories.</p></p>
<p>The Cubs are not going to capture our interest in any way other than trying to figure out what the future Cubs will look like.  Who's leaving?  What might we get in return?  How much room on the payroll does that give us?  Who's available in the off-season?  These are the topics that have already began to interest us and this will only increase as the losses pile up.</p></p>
<p>Expect the new podcast to be up very soon.  Our lack of interest will be pretty evident.  I'm in a tough position this week as my 2nd favorite team, the Angels, travel to Wrigley.  I'm not saying that my loyalty to the Cubs will be tested, but I will say that my 2010 loyalty could be.  If the Angels march into Chicago and play good, solid, fundamental baseball, you give me one reason I shouldn't consider hanging up my Cubs gear for the rest of this season in favor of the Angels.</p></p>
<p>In the soon-to-be-uploaded podcast, we are joined by J, from the Angels blog - <a href="http://www.gardenofhalos.com" mce_href="http://www.gardenofhalos.com" target="_blank">Garden of Halos</a>.  He gives us some good insight into a team that is run and plays the right way.</p></p>
