<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/schwarber1.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/schwarber1-246x300.jpg" alt="schwarber1" width="246" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10083" /></a>With their first selection (4th overall) in the 2014 MLB Draft, the Cubs selected Indiana University catcher, Kyle Schwarber.  Less than two weeks later, Schwarber has not only already signed a contract with the Cubs, but he is with Boise (Class A - Short Season) and absolutely dominating pitching.  The deadline for MLB teams to sign 2014 draft picks is July 18<sup>th</sup>, but Schwarber wasted no time getting into the Cubs system.</p>
<p>Boise started their season on Friday and five games in and after a 2 HR performance today, Schwarber is hitting (a silly) .600/.625/1.350 with 4 home runs.  Yes, 4 home runs in his first 5 games of professional baseball.  </p>
<p>It's no surprise that Schwarber is hitting Northwest League pitching the way he is.  After a college career, Schwarber is advanced for the league.  </p>
<p>This evening, Jordan Bernfield tweeted this:<br />

<p>This promotion comes as no surprise.  Kris Bryant played just two games in Rookie ball before being promoted to Boise for 18 games and then to High-A Daytona for the final 16 games of the 2013 season.  I believe the Cubs want to move these college guys along early to get them at a level that will provide a challenge.  You know, that challenge that Kris Bryant hasn't encountered yet.  </p>
<p>If I had to guess though, I think Schwarber finishes 2014 with Kane County.  This is a team that has already earned a playoff spot and last year and it does not appear that Daytona will be in the post-season if they continue playing the way they have been.  We learned that the front office likes the top prospects to get post-season experience.  Kris Bryant jumped a non-playoff team in Kane County in 2013 to get on the Tennessee roster for the Southern League playoffs.  </p>
<p>If Schwarber finishes 2014 with Kane County and progresses well in the off-season and in Spring Training, perhaps we'll see him jump High-A Daytona and go straight to AA Tennessee.  </p>
<p>Like any Cubs fan in the midwest, I'm happy to see Schwarber moved up to the Midwest League.  My first opportunity to see him play will probably be for our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/790405980993329/" target="_blank">Quad Cities meet-up on July 8th</a> when Kane County visits our hometown QC River Bandits.  There are still spots available if you'd like to join us.  </p>
