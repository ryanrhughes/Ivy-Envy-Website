We record this episode before Wednesday night's Pirates game.  We talk about the extra-innings win on Monday and the fact we never feel like this team is out of it.  Jason Heyward is hitting .310 in the last 7 days, which is a pretty significant improvement.  </p>
<p>We also talk about Kyle Hendricks and the Greg Maddux comparisons.  Corey shares his Arizona Summer League experience and met the daughter of the last Cubs player to score in a World Series game.  </p>
<p>Of course, we have to spend some time talking about Javy and break down his quick tags.  Andy shares what is potentially the last Rube story.  </p>
