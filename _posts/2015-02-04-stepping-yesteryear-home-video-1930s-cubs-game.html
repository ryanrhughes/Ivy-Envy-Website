    on the roof. Coincidence or what?

<p>Here's a fun one that's been making the rounds: home video from some attendees to a Cubs game in the 1930s. It's fantastic footage, a glimpse into a time when men attended the games in full suits and smoked cigars in the stands. <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150203/wrigleyville/home-video-from-1938-gives-look-inside-wrigley-field-when-ivy-was-young">DNAInfo Chicago ran the footage yesterday</a>, noting that it came from a slew of film donated by one family to the Chicago Film Archive. There's so much to love about the video: a cleaner Waveland Ave skyline, the old scoreboard in all its glory, and the way Wrigley looks like it really hasn't changed all <em>that</em> much in the almost 80 years since this game was filmed (though the trees lining the scoreboard and upper center field bleachers would be fun to have back).</p>
<p>As for <em>when</em> the game that's filmed took place, there's no certainty, but there are some guesses. <a href="http://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20150203/wrigleyville/home-video-from-1938-gives-look-inside-wrigley-field-when-ivy-was-young">From the DNAInfo story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One commenter suggests the footage comes from the home opener against the Cardinals on April 22, 1938.</p>
<p>The bleachers were built in 1937, 23 years after Wrigley Field was erected at 1060 W. Addison St. in 1914. Bill Veeck planted the ivy in September of 1937.</p>
<p>Though originally marked as from 1937, the 1938 date could be correct, according to the Chicago Film Archives, as the film date comes from the stock code, and may not be when the reel was actually used.</blockquote><br />
What appears to be a grand pregame processional seems to back this theory up. And, if it is <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN193804220.shtml">the April 22, 1938 game</a>, then it ended in true Cubs fashion: with the Cubs blowing a three run lead in the ninth to lose 6-5. The more things change...</p>
<p>As for the Ricketts sign? No relation to the current owners: it was the name of a local chain of restaurants in the city at the time. It's also nice to know that, judging by the overcoats, April day games were freezing back in the 1930s, too, climate change be damned.</p>
<p>You can check out the whole catalog of the family's film here, which includes <a href="http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/4892">more footage at Wrigley</a> and even <a href="http://www.chicagofilmarchives.org/collections/index.php/Detail/Object/Show/object_id/4765">a winter sports event at Soldier Field</a> before it was made to look like a spaceship (worth it just for the old car driving through A WALL OF FLAMES at the 1:10 mark).</p>
