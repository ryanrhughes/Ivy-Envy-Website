<p>Derrek Lee declined an opportunity to play for team USA yesterday, and his decision angered the anonymous internet commenting community.&nbsp;&nbsp; One commenter voiced his/her anger toward Lee's decision saying, "Somethings in this world are important enough to take risk on ypour country needs you."&nbsp; The beautiful thing about commenting under the name "commenter" is that you don't have to worry about time-consuming things like punctuation.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it is clearly not in the best interests of the Team USA to continue to put Dunn out there at first, they also probably don't want to put someone like Lee out there who isn't quite 100%.&nbsp; There has to be a better healthy first base option out there, right?&nbsp; Just play Lilly at first if you have to.</p>
<p>Some trash talking directed toward the Cubs has also begun to show up via internet comments.&nbsp; People need to keep in mind that preseason games really only can give us an indication of the strengths and weaknesses of individual players.&nbsp; The strength of the team as a whole cannot yet be accurately evaluated.&nbsp; The Cubs have played 23 games so far, and many of the star players have only appeared in about half of those games.&nbsp; It is safe to say that Cubs fans can remain enthusiastic about this team's chances to have a good regular season.&nbsp; All spring training really does is tell us what we already knew or guessed about certain players.&nbsp; For instance, Joey Gathright has already stolen six bases, but he has not hit any home runs.&nbsp; These stats prove that Tim's analysis of Joey Gathright was anything but marginal.&nbsp; We already knew Gathright is a quick man, able to leap tall cars in a single bound.&nbsp; Here you go (in case you haven't seen it already)--</p>
