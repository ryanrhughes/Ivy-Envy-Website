This was our first live recording like this in 6 or 7 years and we had a lot of fun doing it.  </p>
<p>In the episode, we talk about playoff home field advantage, potential match-ups for the NLDS, and what would happen if there was a 3-way tie for the NL Wild Card?  Well, one thing we know...advantage Cubs.  </p>
<p>We answer several listener questions and share a handful of internet muscle flexes.  </p>
