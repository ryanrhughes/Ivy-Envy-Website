<p>I thought I would take this off-day opportunity to point out how "America's Finest News Source," <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank"><em>The Onion</em></a>, has a Cubs fixation.&nbsp; I think their corporate HQ is located in Chicago, so maybe that has something to do with it.&nbsp; Here are some links to just a few of their Cubs-related articles--</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/cubs_to_continue_tradition" target="_blank">"Cubs to Continue Tradition of Playing Baseball"</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/cubs_absence_from_world" target="_blank">"Cubs, Absence from World Series Agree to 4-Year Extension"</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/god_savoring_vast_array_of" target="_blank">"God Savoring Vast Array of Cubs-Cursing Options"</a> --This article refers to the Cubs as God's "least favorite baseball team."</p>
<p>and finally--</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/news_briefs/tampa_bay_rays_fuck_you" target="_blank">"Tampa Bay Rays: 'Fuck You, Cubs'"</a></p>
<p>Even though it hurts a little,&nbsp; it's pretty funny stuff.</p>
