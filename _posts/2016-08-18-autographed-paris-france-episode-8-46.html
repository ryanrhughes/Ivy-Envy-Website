The Cubs beat the Brewers 4 times in 3 days this week. We talk about the series and a few of the highlights, like Rizzo's ledge-catch and Travis Wood's non-flinching abilities.  </p>
<p>Corey was at the day game on Tuesday and shares some thoughts on Aroldis Chapman.  Are Hendricks and Hammel Cy Young worthy?  There's a lot of chatter and we discuss this idea.  Kurt falls into a Scary Stat of the Week and Andy shares a Rube Waddell story with us.  </p>
