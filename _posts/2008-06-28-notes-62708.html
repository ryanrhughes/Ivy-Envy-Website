<p>Yes, I was at Wrigley for the awful game on Thursday against the Baltimore Orioles.&nbsp; This game was painful for me to sit through.&nbsp; I am willing to take responsibility for this ugly game.&nbsp; I took <a id="more"></a><a id="more-108"></a>my brother and dad, both of whom are White Sox fans.&nbsp; My dad even wore a Cubs hat to attempt to embrace that Cubbie spirit, but I'm guessing him wearing the hat was some sort of hex that Sox fans use against the Cubs.&nbsp; I hope to find the time in the next few days to share some pictures from Thursdays game with you.</p>
<p>* What has stood out to me the most in the last two days (losses to Orioles and White Sox) is the bad defense.&nbsp; I was surprised with&nbsp;Edmonds' brain-fart in Center on Thursday, allowing a runner to go from first to third on a routine base hit.&nbsp; Theriot's error in the fifth inning on Thursdays game was pretty frustrating too.&nbsp; It didn't&nbsp;lead to any scoring, but it could have been disastrous.&nbsp; The grounder he booted was off the bat of pitcher Radhames Liz, bringing up the top of the order rather than ending the inning.</p>
<p>* Marquis really looked bad.&nbsp; The five runs with 2 outs in the 3rd inning took all the life out of Wrigley Field.&nbsp; Call me crazy, but after the last week, I don't feel quite so optimistic with a large deficit.&nbsp; Things can't be going well for a pitcher when he gives up 3 doubles in one inning.&nbsp; He ended up giving up 7 runs and 3 walks in 4 innings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Wrigley also lost some buzz and hope for a comeback when Lee was pulled after he hit into a double play&nbsp; in the 5th.&nbsp; Aramis Ramirez was pulled at the same time.&nbsp; By the way, Derek Lee hit into 3 double plays in a row, one on Thursday and two today.&nbsp; I wasn't really in the mood for back-ups during the only game I will probably make it to this year.&nbsp; Daryle Ward and Henry Blanco both came in and knocked runs in.&nbsp; I was also real happy to see Matt Murton get some playing time when Lou shifted Patterson to Center to replace Edmonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I caught a quick clip from the post game press conference with Lou Piniella today and he made it quite clear that Eric Patterson will not be in left field tomorrow.&nbsp; His defense was so poor today (lazy getting the ball in after a popout leading to a tagging runner and an error on a ground ball), it would not surprise me to see him get sent down to Des Moines.&nbsp; I am not a fan of Eric Patterson and I don't see what he really has to offer the Cubs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*&nbsp;All in all, the Cubs are playing poorly in the field.&nbsp; They seem to be channeling the defense we saw under Dusty Baker.&nbsp; Bad throws from the outfield, not hitting cut-off guys and lazy outfield play can really kill a hot team.&nbsp; I'm not ready to throw out the "June Swoon" label yet, but this team looks different than it did a week ago.&nbsp; I see this team picking up momentum as some of these guys like Zambrano, Johnson and Soriano start returning from injuries.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the Cardinals don't seem to be fading away like we would like, and I think the Brewers will probably continue their upward movement.&nbsp; I trust that Lou will keep these guys motivated and improve their recent play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* I know Andy has given him a few plugs, but check out <a href="http://www.qconline.com/bloggers/sports/?p=181#more-181">Matt Veto's Cubs Blog </a>for the Dispatch/Argus.&nbsp; He gave Ivy Envy a shout-out today in his blog.&nbsp;</p>
