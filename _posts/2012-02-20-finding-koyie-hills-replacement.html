<p>After a long five seasons, Koyie Hill is no longer a member of the Chicago Cubs.  I think one more year of Hill and he would have replaced Paul Bako as my most despised back-up catcher.  Finding Koyie Hill's replacement should not be difficult considering he batted .208 and racked up 7 HR and 63 RBIs (total) in those five seasons.  With those stellar numbers, it's no wonder the Cardinals snatched him up.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have three candidates for spot to back up Geovany Soto.  Welington Castillo and Steve Clevenger are coming up from within the system, and they signed Jason Jaramillo, a 30-year old free agent that spent 3 seasons with the Pirates, to a minor league contract.  </p>
<p>Back-up catchers aren't going to put up great offensive numbers.  If they did, they'd be starters.  Jaramillo's offensive line is small step up from Koyie Hill's.  In his three seasons with the Pirates, he hit .235 average, .621 OPS and averaged 4 HR with 38 RBIs.  Jaramillo has some major league experience and when it comes to his defense, he throws out 30% of runners trying to steal.  </p>
<p>Welington Castillo has very limited big league experience - 11 games.  That doesn't even qualify as a "small sample size", so let's just toss it out.  The 24-year old has worked his way up through the Cubs minor league system and played 61 games with Iowa last year.  He finished his time in Iowa in 2011 with a .268 batting average, .876 OPS, 15 HRs and 35 RBIs.  With his decent offensive numbers, his defense is also solid.  He was named the best defensive catcher in the Cubs' minor league system.  He has an above-average arm and a quick release.  He is also ranked the #6 prospect in the organization. </p>
<p>Steve Clevenger, who will turn 26 years old, is also a guy that has worked his way up through the Cubs system.  His major league experience is even less than Castillo - two games.  The left-handed hitting Clevenger spent most of 2011 in Tennessee.  He was called up to Iowa for 25 games and had a .407 batting average and an OPS of 1.023.  Those kinds of numbers will turn some heads.  In his six seasons in the minors, he's hit .319 with an OPS of .857.  Originally a middle-infielder, Clevenger is decent behind the plate, with also an above-average arm.  </p>
<p>My hunch is that this will be between Castillo and Clevenger.  Though, because the back-up obviously does not see much playing time, perhaps the Cubs will want to keep each of these guys getting every-day starts and wait until Soto is injured or traded to let them slide into the starting position.  Since Jaramillo has no long-term future with the Cubs, they could bring him out to put up "Koyie Hill career-year numbers".  </p>
<p>Castillo has power, which the club definitely needs and he could lead to some late-inning pinch hitting fire-power.  However, he's not disciplined at the plate and strikes out quite a bit.  Because he is an all-around better offensive player (except for power), I would probably prefer to see Clevenger get the nod over Castillo.  He gets on base more and strikes out far less.  </p>
<p>The catcher position is an area that the organization has depth at, including at the higher levels of the organization.  This not only allows the Cubs to shop Soto, but also consider trading some of the minor league catching talent without depleting the system.  In a spring without much position jockeying and a fairly set Opening Day line-up, this will be an area to keep an eye on.  </p>
