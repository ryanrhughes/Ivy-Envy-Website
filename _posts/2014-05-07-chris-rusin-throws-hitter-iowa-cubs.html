<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rusincubs501.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rusincubs501-300x232.jpg" alt="Rusin" width="300" height="232" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9683" /></a>Chris Rusin was in contention for the Cubs' 5th starter spot towards the end of Spring Training until a bad outing derailed his bid.  This afternoon, Rusin tossed a complete game no-hitter for the Iowa Cubs as they defeated New Orleans 3-0.  </p>
<p>In his 9 innings pitched, Rusin struck out 3 and walked 2 against the New Orleans line-up that includes former Cubs Justin Bour and Brian Bogusevic.  Rusin threw 118 pitches in the game.  Before today, his longest outing on the season was 7 innings.  </p>
<p>Rusin now has a 2-4 record and dropped his ERA from 4.71 to 3.58.  Before today's game, Rusin's numbers had not looked overly impressive, but tossing a no-hitter is obviously quite an accomplishment.  </p>
