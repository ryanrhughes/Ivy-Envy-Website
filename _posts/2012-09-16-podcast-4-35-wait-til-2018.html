<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Jeremy convene to talk about the Cubs as we enter the last few weeks of the 2012 season.  We look at the 2013 schedule and note that the Cubs have some rough stretches facing them.  We check in on Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters, and discuss the idea of Vitters as a legitimate option for the future of 3rd base.  </p>
<p>We look at the September call-ups, which basically amounts to noting the Dave Sappelt is playing well.  We talk more about the Cubs pulling out of Peoria, and we wait for the announcement to be made.  Then, we go through some listener-submitted questions.</p>
<p>Kurt gives us his scary stat of the week and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
