  At the end of the Cubs' 2007 playoff three-and-out, we once again said, "Wait 'til next year," and for once the words weren't sarcastic or an empty phrase meant to soften defeat.&nbsp; We felt confident saying them.

  So for the past couple of days, I've been casually sifting through Cubs-related internet commentary and media for some closure on this exciting yet ultimately disappointing season.&nbsp; Instead of <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?mid=200810053593261&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">video clips</a> of Soriano saying that even though we were the better team, the Dodgers just played better, I want a news clip saying that Soriano was seen late at night dejectedly practicing hitting breaking balls to right field for base hits.&nbsp; Though the players have expressed plenty of <a href="http://markderosa.mlblogs.com/archives/2008/10/its_over.html" target="_blank">frustration and regret</a>, I find myself wanting more than a simple, "Wait 'til next year."&nbsp; So here are a few of the write-ups I've read that have helped me get some perspective and closure on this season:
