<p>On this episode, Jeremy joins Andy and Corey via Skype.  Corey talks about the Cubs Caravan stop in Peoria on Thursday, January 12th.  Jeremy then shares his experiences at Cubs Convention.</p>
<p>The Cubs take a step into the modern baseball era that traditionalist Cubs fans are not happy to see.  A 75 foot LED display and standing-room-only patio will now occupy the area above the right-field well.  Also, the Cubs bring back Kerry Wood, who is quickly becoming a Cubs legend, not so much for just what he did on the field, but because of his dedication to the city, the organization and the fans.  </p>
<p>We discuss these two topics and read the entries for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
