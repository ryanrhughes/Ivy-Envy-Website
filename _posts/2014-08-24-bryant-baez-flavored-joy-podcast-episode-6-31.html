  content: Just finished listening.....  In the muscle flexes, you guys started talking
    about Rick Telander and what a fan you guys are of his work.  During the off-season
    or early spring of this year, I heard him on David Kaplan's Sportstalk Live saying
    that Cubs weren't going to be good for 20 years.  I pretty much had the same thoughts
    as you guys did....

  content: It just goes to show that these "sports writers/announcers/talking
    heads" actually don't know that much about what is going on. It is so ridiculously
    obvious when they talk about our teams that we should really just question EVERY
    SINGLE THING they say or write.

<p>Who would have known that the biggest story of the week in Cubs-land would involve the grounds crew?  We talk about this situation and use it as an opportunity to talk about the (negative) attention that the Cubs, ownership and the front office receive.  </p>
<p>Corey went up to Wrigley for Social Media Night and talks about this event and tells you why you should attend next year.  </p>
<p>Edwin Jackson continues his poor performances and has ended up on the disabled list.  We talk about how wrong we were in predicting he would play well this year and look at his future...both with the organization and the type of pitcher he could become.  </p>
<p>There is about a week of the minor league baseball season left.  We use this opportunity to go through the system and look at the playoff chances for Boise, Kane County, Daytona, Tennessee and Iowa.  </p>
<p>We answer listener questions, Kurt gives us a scary stat of the week, we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest and we read a few internet muscle flexes.  </p>
