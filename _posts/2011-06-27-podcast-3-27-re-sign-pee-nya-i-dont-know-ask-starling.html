<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey through Skype to talk about the recent play of the Cubs.  We talk about the Midwest League All-Star Game and HR Derby.  We talk about Carlos Pena's hot-streak and if the Cubs should consider signing him in the off-season.  </p>
<p>Oscar from California asks us about the decisions that Hendry faces heading into the trading deadline.  We take a brief detour from baseball talk and give some music recommendations.  Bob from the UK asks about the future of Wrigley and we talk about what we would like to see with the ballpark.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
