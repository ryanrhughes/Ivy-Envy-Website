On this episode, we check in on the Cubs post-season status as they continue marching to the playoffs.  </p>
<p>Kyle Hendricks and Kris Bryant earn NL monthly awards in August and we look at their performances.  We commend the bullpen on their incredible pitching in this last series with the Giants.  We answer some listener questions, Kurt shares a Scary Stat of the Week, and we've got some pretty strong Internet Muscle Flexes to share. </p>
