<p>It's Part One of our NL Central Division Preview.&nbsp; Andy, Corey and Kurt invite fans and bloggers of other teams in the division on the show to help you size up the Cubs' divisional opponents.</p></p>
<p>Scott Morschhauser is possibly the only Pittsburgh Pirates fan in the Quad Cities and he talks with us about the state of the franchise and what people can expect out of the Pirates for the next few years.</p></p>
<p>To discuss the Houston Astros with us, we welcome James Yasko back on the podcast with us.&nbsp; James runs the blog Astros County.</p></p>
