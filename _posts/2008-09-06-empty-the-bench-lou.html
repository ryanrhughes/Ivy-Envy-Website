  (4-15) coming up, now would be the perfect opportunity to empty the bench.&nbsp; "

  content: McGehee proved what he could do today.  2 for 3; 2 RBI's.  Just like Friday

    Andy, you're an artist.  I think the readers of Ivy Envy deserve some sort of ongoing cartoon/comic of Henry "Caveman" Blanco.

    Give the people what they want.

<p>I think right now with this six-game skid, it would be kind of interesting to see what kind of a spark all of the bench players could provide if they all started at the same time.&nbsp; With fearsome opposing pitchers like Cueto (8-12) and Harang (4-15) coming up, now would be the perfect opportunity to empty the bench.&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-213"></a>We could have Ward in right, Fukudome in center, and Johnson in Left.&nbsp; In the infield, McGehee at third, Cedeno at short, Fontenot at second, and Hoffpauir at first.&nbsp; Finally, we could give Soto and the caveman a rest and play Hill behind the plate.&nbsp; I don't know about you, but I'd like to see what McGehee and Hoffpauir could do with four at-bats in one game.&nbsp; Just an idea.</p>
