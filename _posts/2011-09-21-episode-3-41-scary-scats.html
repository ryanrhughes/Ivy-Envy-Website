<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt get together and bring Jeremy in on Skype for this episode.  We discuss the length of the regular season for MLB and if it should be shortened.  We compare our attendance to Cubs games in 2011 compared to seasons past.  We also read an e-mail from UK Bob on his trip to Chicago to watch the Cubs.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have called up Steve Clevenger and Rafael Dolis and we look at these two players from the Tennessee Smokies.  </p>
<p>We go through a handful of listener-suggested topics and cover:<br />
*  Storm Troopers at Wrigley Field<br />
*  The Bears' offensive-line.<br />
*  Sunday's instant replay mess.<br />
*  Castro's pursuit of 200 hits.<br />
*  The starting rotation for the Cubs in 2012.<br />
*  Possible off-season moves.</p>
<p>We also consider how much we would personally spend for Soriano to not return to the Cubs in 2012.  </p>
<p>We botch the Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for the photo caption contest.  </p>
