<p>It's got to be <a href="http://twitter.com/OzzieGuillen" target="_blank">Ozzie Guillen on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; Ozzie's only been on Twitter a few weeks, but he's provided me many chuckles while I sit at my desk at work.&nbsp; There is really not a person in baseball that I would rather see on Twitter.  There's nothing but a text message standing between Ozzie's brain and the general public.&nbsp; Today was especially entertaining to me.&nbsp; Ozzie tweeted 8 times in 17 minutes.&nbsp; Ozzie was apparently bored in a car, stuck in traffic on the 101 or 202 in the Valley of the Sun.</p>
