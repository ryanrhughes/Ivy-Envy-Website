  content: "First person in the \"I hate\" sentence is Bronson Arroyo.  Love that.
    \ That guy is a sponge.  I was just actually watching that \"Four Days in October\"
    doc on ESPN, and everytime Arroyo talked it felt like I was getting strangled
    by lightning on fire.  \r\n\r\nA couple of other points on your points:\r\n\r\nLet
    me know when you plan on redirecting the site so I can do an article on how unbelievably
    awesome the Philadelphia Phillies are.  \r\n\r\nThe real Carlos Zambrano is an
    bipolar.  Is that fair?  (I mean, it doesn't answer your question - but is it?)\r\n\r\nWe
    better not see any sort of a sophomore slump for either of those guys they're
    our stars now.  \r\n\r\nCubs bloggers will complain about the urinal cakes not
    being edible."

<p>We'd like to apologize for not posting much in the last month or so.  I'm assuming it's not that big of a deal though, because you're probably about as interested in reading about the Cubs as we are writing about them.  Thanks to you all for keeping up on our site and podcast this year.  It was a pretty eventful season with very few of them being positive in nature.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I have realized that one of the reasons I have not posted on the site much is because I am using <a href="http://www.twitter.com/IvyEnvy" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a> to just get little tidbits out there and instead of forming them into posts, I keep them to 140 characters or less.&nbsp; As silly as it seems, I do enjoy using Twitter to blast a few thoughts out here and there.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; If you haven't listened to our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=3277" target="_blank">last podcast</a>,check it out for our last thoughts on this 2010 season.&nbsp; Towards the end, Paul brings up the idea of the Cubs leaving Wrigley and it leads to some pretty good conversation.&nbsp; Last year, we did a few off-season podcasts and I will imagine we'll do a few this year.&nbsp; The first will probably be when the Cubs name the new manager.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I can't root for the Reds in the playoffs.&nbsp; I hate Bronson Arroyo, Dusty Baker, Joey Votto, Marty Brennaman, etc.&nbsp; I typically pull for NL Central and Midwest teams.&nbsp; I'll be rooting for the Twins and the Giants (I've decided to look past the fact that Brian Wilson closes out their games).&nbsp; And by "rooting for", I mean "not watching any of the games, but checking the scores in the paper the next morning".</p>
<p>*&nbsp; Speaking of the Reds, congrats to Brian over at <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo's Goggles</a>.&nbsp; Who woulda thunk?&nbsp; At the beginning of the season, we made a wager with Brian that if the Cubs won their season series with the Reds, for 3 days, he would re-direct his site to our site.&nbsp; And, if the Reds won the season series, when you go to www.ivyenvy.com, you will be re-directed to his site.&nbsp; So at some point in the next month, we will disappear for three days and if you go to www.ivyenvy.com, you will be able to read Chris' posts on how much it hurts for your team to fall apart in the post-season.</p>
<p>*&nbsp; I will go through and score the standings for the Ivy Envy MLB Final Standings Challenge we did this year.&nbsp; I'll post the results.&nbsp; I'll come up with something to give the winner.</p>
<p>So stay tuned to the site.&nbsp; There ARE things to talk about.&nbsp; Who should be the new manager?&nbsp; Who is going to play 1st base for the Cubs next year?&nbsp; Can we expect a Sophomore Slump from Starlin Castro and Tyler Colvin?&nbsp; Who is the real Carlos Zambrano and will he be pitching for the Cubs next year?&nbsp; What other minuscule changes will be made to Wrigley that Cubs fans and bloggers will blow out of proportion?</p>
<p>We at Ivy Envy will do our best to give you our spin on these topics as we continue to provide strong opinions and marginal analysis of the Chicago Cubs.</p>
