This has been another miserable winter and with our trip just days away and Cubs Spring Training games starting tomorrow, we can't wait to get out to Arizona.</p>
<p>In addition to recording our 300<sup>th</sup> episode while we are out there, we will also be hosting a meet-up during the Cubs @ Diamondbacks.  While this game isn't a home game for the Cubs at Sloan Park, it is a night game and our last night at Spring Training, so we let's wrap up the week strong.  </p>
<p>We have created a Facebook event for the meet-up - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/795777117178983/" target="_blank">Ivy Envy Spring Training Meet-up</a>.  If you are planning on attending, join the event and we can discuss the meet-up and any plans surrounding the event. </p>
