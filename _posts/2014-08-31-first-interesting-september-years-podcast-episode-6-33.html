<p>Jorge Soler has made quite an impact in the first week of his MLB career.  We talk about the week, looking at Soler's performance, but also discuss how much more interested we are in Cubs baseball this September than we have been for a very long time, even though the team is in last place in the division.  </p>
<p>Starlin Castro made a mental mistake in the Reds series that brought out a variety of emotions from pundits and fans.  We explain our immediate and then more measured reactions.  </p>
<p>Corey talks about the Cubs hiring of Jason Parks and Andy looks at the rotation for the rest of the 2014 season.  We answer listener questions and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
