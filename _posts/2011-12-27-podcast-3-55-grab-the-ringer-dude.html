<p>Andy and Kurt join Corey through Skype in this jam-packed episode. We start things off with Tom Ricketts and his interview with Kaplan on CSN, which aired Christmas Day. Corey gets offended at the charity that the Cubs offer those in need.</p>
<p>Then we race through all the transactions of the last week, which include: Reed Johnson, Sean Marshall, Travis Wood, Dave Sappelt, Ronald Torreyes, Jason Jaramillo, Manny Corpas, Andy Sonnanstine and Jeff Bianchi.</p>
<p>It was a lot to accomplish in one week and it's clear that the Cubs were on a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088967/" target="_blank">Crime-Wave</a>&nbsp;through the free agent market.</p>
