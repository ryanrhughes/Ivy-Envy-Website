<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>On this, the 338<sup>th</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the Cubs being the 4<sup>th</sup> best team in baseball and the 3<sup>rd</sup> best team in the division.  We actually allow ourselves to talk about the 2015 playoffs.  Are we ready to write off the NL Central and hand it over to the Cardinals?  </p>
<p>After taking care of the Giants with a 4-game sweep, we have a little bit more confidence in a wild card spot and look at the lead the Pirates have.  How amazing would it be for the Cubs to host the 1-game wild care play-in game?</p>
<p>Starlin Castro gets time at 2<sup>nd</sup> base.  We also answer some listener questions on Jorge Soler, Chris Coghlan, Javier Baez, Mike Olt and Kris Bryant.</p>
