<p>Andy and I will be live-blogging via <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a> during today's trip up to Wrigley Field to watch the Cubs take on the Cardinals.  From what I remember, the times on these entries can be messed up.  So don't let the times confuse you.<br />
<br><br />
<strong>6:14:11 AM</strong>: About to head to Wrigley. Had work people over last night and got about 4 hrs of sleep.  This is going to be a long day.<br><strong>1:19:07 AM</strong>: Yes, we are aware that it's a little excessive to live only 2.5 hours from Chicago and leave at 6:30am for a 3pm game.<br><br><strong>1:34:55 AM</strong>: Zune is loaded with two episodes of Planned Brotherhood for the trip today.  Best podcast out there.<br></p>
