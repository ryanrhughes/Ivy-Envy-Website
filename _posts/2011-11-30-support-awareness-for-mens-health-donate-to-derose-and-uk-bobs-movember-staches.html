<p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=6434" target="_blank">this week's podcast episode</a>, a couple of readers/listeners (UK Bob and DeRose) are participating in Movember.  I'm sure most of you are familiar with Movember, but if you're not, this is taken from the official Movember website:</p>
<blockquote><p>During November each year, Movember is responsible for the sprouting of moustaches on thousands of men&rsquo;s faces, in the US and around the world. With their Mo&rsquo;s, these men raise vital funds and awareness for men&rsquo;s health, specifically prostate cancer and other cancers that affect men.<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>This is a very worthwhile cause and we'd appreciate it if you joined us in supporting DeRose, UK Bob and all men.   </p>
