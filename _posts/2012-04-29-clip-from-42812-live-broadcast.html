<p>Earlier this month, we started broadcasting our podcast recordings live, in video, to our site.  At 10am Central on (most) Saturday mornings, you can go to our website and click on the "Live Broadcast" graphic and watch us record the podcast.  </p>
<p>Here is a clip from this week's episode.  We talk about the unexpected success of the Cubs in the last week against the Reds, Cardinals and Phillies.  Our next episode will be this upcoming Saturday, which is May 5th.  Head over to our site, watch and join in the chat.  </p>
