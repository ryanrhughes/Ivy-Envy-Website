<p>It's our third podcast episode from Spring Training. &nbsp;We took in a morning of the Minor League Camp at Fitch Park and describe the events there. &nbsp;We attended the rain-shortened Cubs @ Angels game at Tempe Diablo Stadium, but weren't able to see much of the game. &nbsp;As we headed out to leave, we noticed something that hundreds of Cubs fans around us did not.</p>
<p>Please excuse the 45 seconds of electronic interference (or something) at the 46 minute mark.</p>
