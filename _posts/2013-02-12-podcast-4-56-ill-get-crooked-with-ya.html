  content: "[...] I&#8217;m sure many Cubs fans are horrified that Campana is actually
    gone. They probably held out hopes that he would clear waivers and then stay in
    the Cubs system and go to Iowa. If you still need to understand why losing the
    one-tool Campana is not a big deal, listen to the Tony Campana scary stats in
    Episode 4.56 of The Ivy Envy Podcast. [...]"

    Podcast 4.56 - "I'll get crooked with ya" - Ivy Envy
---
<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt sit behind the mics as the Chicago Cubs pitchers and catchers have reported to Mesa and have begun workouts.  Next week, we are scheduled to have Tim Sheridan from <a href="http://boysofspring.com" target="_blank">Boys Of Spring</a> on the podcast to talk about what he is seeing at Fitch Park.  </p>
<p>The Chicago Cubs designate Tony Campana for assignment and many fans are horrified the Cubs would do this to their favorite player.  We put Campana's stats into context and it's pretty clear many fans horribly over-value Campana.  Corey gives you a slew of scary Tony Campana stats.  </p>
<p>Despite attempts by the Cubs to trade Carlos Marmol, he is with the Cubs at Spring Training.  Do you think Carlos Marmol will be on the Cubs roster come Opening Day?  We look at the reasons he will or won't be with the Cubs in 6 or 7 weeks.  </p>
<p>Last week on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/podcast-4-55-willing-to-die-for-the-worst-team-in-baseball/" target="_blank">Podcast 4.55</a>, we looked over the non-roster invitee list and picked a few players we were especially interested in.  This week, we pick the players on the 40-man roster that we are interested in tracking this spring.  </p>
<p>We had a few topic suggestions from our <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.  Michael suggested that we celebrate Fat Tuesday by remembering some of the heavier former Chicago Cubs players.  Carlos Silva, Carlos Zambrano, Antonio Alfonseca, Ron Cey, Dan Vogelbach, Randall Simon, Glenallen Hill, Marlon Byrd and Earl Cunningham are all discussed.  Nick from Virginia asks what pitchers the Cubs catchers are not looking forward to seeing this spring.  </p>
<p>We have a few Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
