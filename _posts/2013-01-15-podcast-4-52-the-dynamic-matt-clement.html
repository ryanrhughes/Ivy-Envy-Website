<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt start things off in this podcast episode with the news that the old dugout and bullpen phones will be replaced with cell phones, thanks to T-Mobile.  We consider the things that could wrong, and we talk about the phone situation with baseball purism in mind.  </p>
<p>Cubs Caravan and Cubs Convention are coming up in the next week.  Corey will be in Peoria Wednesday night.  You can follow our <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/ivyenvypodcast" target="_blank">Facebook</a> for updates from the event.  Jeremy will be in Chicago for Cubs Convention and he will be on the podcast next week to share what he saw and heard over the weekend.  </p>
<p>We agree that we don't have much of a desire to go to Cubs Convention this year.  One of the most entertaining aspects of these events is the Q&A sessions with the crowd and we tell you what we would ask the members of the front office and management if we had the opportunity.  </p>
<p>The Cubs signed a name from the past in the last week, Dontrelle Willis.  We look back on his career since that fateful series against the Cubs in 2003.  </p>
<p>Sammy Sosa has made a cold week in January without baseball incredibly entertaining this week as he dove head-first into social networks.  We spend a good amount of time looking at <a href="http://pinterest.com/sammysosamr609/sammy-sosa-sammy-sosa-official-pinterest/" target="_blank">Sammy's Pinterest page</a>.  If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to take a few seconds and check out his pins.  Sammy Sosa.  Yes, he's the real Sammy Sosa, and this is his Pinterest.</p>
<p>We used one of his photos for the caption contest this week and we probably set a record with the number of entries.  </p>

<p>As usual, we look over the Cubs.com article comments to find a few <strong>Cubs.com Muscle Flexes of the Week</strong>...and they don't disappoint.  </p>
