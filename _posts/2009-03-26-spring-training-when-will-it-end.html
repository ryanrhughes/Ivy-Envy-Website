<p>I'll admit that six weeks ago, I could not wait for Spring Training to begin.&nbsp; I can't stand NBA basketball and just don't follow the NFL or College Basketball closely.&nbsp; So when College Football ends, I'm ready for Spring Training.&nbsp; Throughout January and February, all I can think about is baseball starting up.</p>
<p>So now, about six weeks into Spring Training, I'm sick of it.&nbsp; I'm tired of spotty media coverage.&nbsp; I'm tired of stories that are only reported on because it's March and there's nothing else to report.&nbsp; It's not that I don't enjoy position battles.&nbsp; I just don't like it when those battles are all there is to talk about.&nbsp; I want to feel the excitement of a close ballgame, a clutch hit or a winning streak.&nbsp; I want to feel the frustration of poor fielding, cold bats and a losing streak.&nbsp; That's baseball, and I'm ready.</p>
<p>There's only about a week and a half of Spring Training left.&nbsp; Then we can talk about things that really matter.&nbsp; We can talk about topics that are fluid.&nbsp; We can live and die with our Cubs on a daily basis.</p>
<p>That said, I'm going to go watch the Cubs play the Giants in a Spring Training game on the MLB Network.</p>
