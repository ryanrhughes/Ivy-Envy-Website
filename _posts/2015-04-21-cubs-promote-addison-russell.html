<p>On the most recent episode of the podcast, we guessed that we most likely wouldn't see highly-touted prospect Addison Russell with the big league club until after the Super Two cutoff at the earliest. &nbsp;We were a little off. &nbsp;The Cubs are bringing Russell up, and he will start in tonight's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>
<p>Due to the timing of their call-ups, both Russell and Kris Bryant will now be arbitration-eligible four times instead of the usual three, and that will cost the Cubs more money as the years of team control go by. &nbsp;With these promotions, the club is showing that they want to field the best team they can, and right now that means Addison Russell at second instead of Arismendy Alcantara or Herrera. &nbsp;For now, Alcantara has been optioned to Iowa.</p>
<p>In January, ESPN's Keith Law put out his list of the top 100 prospects, and he had Russell ranked at number four. &nbsp;Kris Bryant was number one, and Jorge Soler was number fourteen. &nbsp;Now, they're all in the Cubs lineup. &nbsp;God bless us, everyone!</p>
