<p>But Matt, we will miss you.&nbsp; You only got to start one game and came in as a pinch-hitter most of the time.&nbsp; Granted, you only hit .214, but I appreciate those three hits you gave us.&nbsp; I hope to see you in a Cubs uniform again.&nbsp; Go back to Iowa, show everyone what you are made of.&nbsp; It might help if you were to get an extra-base hit or two.</p>
<p>Just look at his face in this picture, you know he's sad to leave the Friendly Confines to go back to Des Moines.</p>
