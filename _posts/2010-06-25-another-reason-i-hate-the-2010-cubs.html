  content: "First of all, Zambrano is a tool.  I understand showing passion and wanting
    your ballclub to win, but after one inning?  Those were solid rips down the line...Both
    of them.  You think Carlos' fat ass would have been able to grab those?  Of course
    not.  And I'm the guy who always says that when Carlos loses his shit, it happens
    REALLY fast, but I thought he'd be able to hold out AT LEAST until the fourth
    out he recorded.\r\n\r\nIt was a shame all of this had to also happen against
    the White Sox, who are not only our crosstown counterparts, but are on a tear
    right now and look to be garnering WAY more interest than we are going to achieve
    this season.\r\n\r\nIt seems weird that a few weeks back Corey was saying how
    he hadn't had less interest in the Cubs in a very long time, and now bad goes
    to worse.  \r\n\r\nIt's hard for me to focus on the Cubs right now.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>The Cubs were dealt another series loss in Seattle this week, salvaging the last game of the series.&nbsp; Before Andy and I recorded Podcast 2.15, we were discussing that it feels like the Cubs have had a lot of series in which they lose the first two games and win the third.&nbsp; So let's take a look at the numbers of the series in the 2010 season, so far.</p>
<p>After the series loss to the Mariners, the Cubs are 7-16-1 in series in 2010.&nbsp; Though the Cubs have lost a lot in 2010, they've only been swept once (remember the Pirates?).&nbsp;&nbsp; They have lost 2/3 of the series they've played.</p>
<p>Of the first 25 series (including the first game in this weekend's White Sox series), the Cubs have lost game 1 of the series 17 times.&nbsp; That is nearly 70% of the series, thus far.</p>
<p>As Andy and I were discussing this, I made the comment that it seems like they lose the first two games of a series and then somewhat salvage it with a win in the third game.&nbsp; We went through to see how many series ended up L-L-W.&nbsp; This has happened 9 times this season.&nbsp; That's about 40% of the series this season, and 75% of the series they have lost 2-1.&nbsp; Mathematically speaking (which I don't often), you would expect this to happen about 1/3 of the time, so that 75% really stands out and seems odd to me.</p>
<p>Usually, when a team wins the third game of a series to avoid a sweep, the hope is that they carry that momentum into the next series.&nbsp; Of the 9 times they have won the third game of a series to avoid a sweep, they have won the first game of the next series twice.&nbsp; That's 22% of the time.</p>
<p>So we've established a few things here.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Cubs lose a lot of series - way more than they win.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The Cubs often avoid sweeps by winning the final game of a series.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Cubs don't carry any momentum of that win into the next series.</p>
