<p>Yesterday, apparently drunk and delusional from the Cubs' three-game winning streak, <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20110726/sports/707269737/" target="_blank">Mike Quade voiced</a> that he might see the light at the end of the tunnel after over 100 games and the Cubs could work their way into contention in the final 60 games of the season.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I know we&rsquo;re on the road, but we&rsquo;re playing better. We got a bunch of quality starts on the homestand, which we&rsquo;ll need some more of. And if we get those, we&rsquo;ve got every right to think we&rsquo;ve got a real good chance to compete with these guys."</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what? It&rsquo;s a funny game. We might come out of this road trip in real good shape as far as how we play here. If we do, there&rsquo;s still a lot of baseball left. I take nothing for granted and put nothing past these guys. We won three in a row against Houston. Let&rsquo;s see if we can win tonight and go from there."</p>
<p>"If we stay in games, and keep ourselves in games with a good start, then I think we have an excellent chance, just look around. The game is about pitching."</blockquote><br />
Yeah...about that, Mike. &nbsp;The Cubs rank 3rd to last in the MLB in pitching.</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's an interesting division to be in that situation. &nbsp;What is there, 60 games left? Let's play them and see. I concede nothing. We're going to play, and we'll see what happens. Daunting task. Four teams in front of you. We haven't played well. But why not?"</blockquote><br />
I wonder if last night's 3-2 loss caused Quade to change his tune at all? &nbsp;Maybe losing a game to one of the four teams that Quade thinks the Cubs might be able to conquer was a reality check for him.</p>
<p>The Cubs have won three games in a row. &nbsp;Now they are the only team in baseball that has not won four games in a row. &nbsp;And as exhibited in last night's game, they can still load the bases with no outs and not score a run. &nbsp;I feel bad for the guy for having to manage this team.</p>
