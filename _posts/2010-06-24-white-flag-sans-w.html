  content: At this point I would say Soriano is our best player, but Soto is by far
    our most consistent player

<p>There aren't too many good things to say about the Cubs right now.&nbsp; I watched all of Tuesday night's terrible game and only some of last night's equally terrible game.&nbsp; What the crap is up with Wells?&nbsp; It's too bad that Marshall and Gorzelanny are both lefties because it's looking like Wells should get a demotion.&nbsp; The Cubs mostly still seem to have a terrible approach at the plate--swinging for the fences when the situation calls for getting on base (not to mention the fact that they are hitting at pitcher-friendly Safeco).&nbsp; The double-play ball also seems to be showing up a lot lately too.&nbsp; Twenty men left on base yesterday, with Lee and Nady each having five a piece.</p>
<p>However, there are a couple players showing up to play.&nbsp; Though Soto didn't have the best game last night, he didn't leave anyone on base, and he seems to be continuing his patience at the plate.&nbsp; He drew two walks in Tuesday night's game, and his OBP is .405 currently.&nbsp; Soriano also continues to hit, and lately has been getting a lot of base hits.&nbsp; Byrd seems to be working well in the lead off spot--he has four hits in the past two games.&nbsp; Imagine that!&nbsp; The Cubs' lead off man getting on base.&nbsp; Still the middle of the order has been abysmal, so Byrd's efforts have been wasted.&nbsp; When I listened to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=2904" target="_blank">Veto's interview with Ramirez</a>, it was nice to hear that Ramirez does seem to realize the urgency of the situation.&nbsp; Maybe he can come in there tomorrow and put a charge in the lineup.</p>
<p>This team seems to be waving the white flag... and it doesn't have a "W" in the middle of it.</p>
