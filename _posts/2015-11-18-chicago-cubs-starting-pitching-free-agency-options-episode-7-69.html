This week, the Cubs organization brought home three awards, the Rookie of the Year (Kris Bryant), Manager of the Year (Joe Maddon) and the Cy Young (Jake Arrieta).  We talk about what these awards mean to the individual players and the organization.  We also look at how these awards could help the Cubs attract their desired free agents.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have a new radio home, 670AM The Score.  Crane Kenney also shared the Cubs plans to have their own network when the current tv deal has expired.  </p>
<p>We've received a lot of email about the Cubs options with free agents, specifically with starting pitchers.  On this episode, we explore the different routes the Cubs could take to strengthen their starting pitching, from free agents to trades.  </p>
