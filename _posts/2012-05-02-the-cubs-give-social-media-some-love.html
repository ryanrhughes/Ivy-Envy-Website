<p>The Chicago Cubs will be hosting their inaugural Social Media Night two weeks from today, Wednesday May 16th.  As an individual that enjoys and utilizes new/social media, I think it's great to see the Cubs valuing and appreciating it.  </p>
<p>By purchasing the special Social Media Night tickets, fans will receive special perks that are only available with these tickets.  For $27 (before taxes and fees), you will receive:</p>
<p>* <strong>Entry to the pre-game Social Media Panel Discussion at the Captain Morgan Club.</strong><br />
The panel will feature Chicago Bears field kicker, Robbie Gould (<a href="http://twitter.com/robbiegould09" target="_blank">@RobbieGould09</a>), Cubs.com beat reporter, Carrie Muskat (<a href="http://twitter.com/carriemuskat" target="_blank">@CarrieMuskat</a>), and Chicago Cubs Public Relations and Marketing Specialist, Kevin Saghy (<a href="http://twitter.com/cubs" target="_blank">@Cubs</a>).  The panel will discuss social media from an athlete, media, and club perspective.  This will begin at 5:45pm.</p>
<p>* <strong>A pack of Cubs Social Media Baseball Cards.</strong><br />

Many packs include a card autographed by a Cubs player on Twitter, such as Kerry Wood (<a href="http://twitter.com/kerrywood" target="_blank">@KerryWood</a>), Ryan Dempster (<a href="http://twitter.com/RyanDempsterFDN" target="_blank">@RyanDempsterFDN</a>), Paul Maholm (<a href="http://twitter.com/paul_maholm" target="_blank">@paul_maholm</a>), David DeJesus (@David_DeJesus3) and Ian Stewart (<a href="http://twitter.com/@IAN_STEWART_9" target="_blank">@IAN_STEWART_9</a>).</p>
<p>* <strong>Complimentary Gift Bag</strong><br />
 The gift bag will contain a Social Media t-shirt. Also included is an issue of Vine Line and a voucher for a Classic Vienna Beef hot dog.<br />

<p>* <strong>Game Ticket</strong><br />
Each Social Media Night ticket includes a general admittance ticket to the Budweiser Bleachers for the game that night, in which the Cubs host the Philadelphia Phillies.  </p>
<p>The Cubs encourage attendees to tweet using the #CubsSocial hashtag throughout the event.  </p>
<p>I will be attending this event and I would assume there will be other Cubs bloggers in attendance, as well.  If you'd like to attend, the dedicated Social Media Night tickets must be purchased through the Special Events page at cubs.com/specialevents or in person at the Wrigley Field Box Office.  If you have questions about this event, direct them to the Cubs official Twitter account - @Cubs</p>
<p>If this wasn't enough to entice you, the fact he has not been invited to participate has sent Paul Sullivan into a tizzy.  That alone should make you want to support the event.  As I said, I will be there for the event with a few people.  We'll be in Wrigleyville most of the afternoon.  If you're interested in meeting up for an Old Style, tweet me - <a href="http://twitter.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">@IvyEnvy</a>.  </p>
