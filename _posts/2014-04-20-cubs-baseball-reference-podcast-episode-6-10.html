<p><a href="/uploads/2014/04/WINNER-8.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/04/WINNER-8-300x300.png" alt="WINNER (8)" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9750" /></a>Andy, Corey and Kurt convene to talk about a pretty bad week in Chicago Cubs baseball.  The Cubs are swept in a series in less than 10 hours and then lose 2 out of three to the Reds.  There was very little in the way of offense.  Kurt talks a little about the Yankees series and then we look at some positives.  Edwin Jackson has a strong outing and Jeff Samardzija LOOKS like an ace.  </p>
<p>We check on Jake Arrieta and Javier Baez, both returning from injuries.  We look back at the free agency signings the front office has made since they took over the Cubs.  </p>
<p>At the end of the episode, I talk about my brother, who happens to be a White Sox fan.  He will be going with us to the Wrigley 100th game and claims that he may ditch the White Sox for the Cubs.  So help Patrick see the light.  Tweet us your best Cubs pitch, and you can use #Patrick4Cubs if you'd like.  </p>
