<p><a href="/uploads/2014/05/WINNER-11.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/05/WINNER-11-300x300.png" alt="WINNER (11)" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9914" /></a>Jeff Samardzija's bad luck/bad team continues.  He's now got an 0-3 record after 8 starts despite a 1.45 ERA.  This situation with Samardzija has led to the discussion of wins/losses stats for pitchers.  We weigh in on this and agree that the record doesn't indicate how good the pitcher is, but it does matter for other reasons.  </p>
<p>We dip down into the minor leagues for a while.  Chris Rusin threw a no-hitter for Iowa, Jorge Soler is back and Kris Bryant is a beast.  We answer several listener submitted questions, give a few scary stats and pick a winner for this week's caption contest.</p>
<p>If you have a few minutes, we'd really appreciate it if you would fill out a listener survey for us.  You can find it here:  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/survey" target="_blank">Ivy Envy Listener Survey</a>.<br />
