We start things off by not necessarily discussing Kris Bryant's numbers and fawning over him, but talking about the timing of his promotion to AAA Iowa.  We come up with a few possible explanations why it hasn't happened yet and we speculate what we believe the Cubs plan may be for Bryant.  </p>
<p>Kyle Schwarber has signed with the Cubs and started creating a buzz in Boise.  We answer a handful of listener questions, read a few Internet Muscle Flexes and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
