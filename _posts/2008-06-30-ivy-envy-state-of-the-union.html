<p>First off, we'd like to thank all of you that read Ivy Envy.&nbsp; We really enjoy sharing our love of the Cubs with you, and it's been fun to share conversations with you that we normally have with each other.&nbsp; Thanks for reading and please, jump in with your opinions whenever you'd like.&nbsp; Also, please share Ivy Envy with any Cubs fans you know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a lot of ideas that we would like to do with Ivy Envy, but at this point, we are pretty limited with what Wordpress will allow.&nbsp; We are looking at doing something to free ourselves up a little bit to do what we would like.&nbsp; The first thing we are going to try is <a id="more"></a><a id="more-112"></a>an inning-by-inning game summary.&nbsp; We will be doing this for Tuesday night's game against the Giants.&nbsp; Because of our limitations on Wordpress, this will be put on the site after the game.&nbsp; Live updates would be ideal, but it's just not possible right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also looking at starting an Ivy Envy podcast.&nbsp; We will keep you updated with major additions or changes to Ivy Envy.</p>
