<p>The Cubs are now mathematically eliminated from the playoffs as of Tuesday, and with only a few games left, we all have to move on to other time vacuums.&nbsp; <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=443" target="_blank">We all predicted that the Cubs would go out more like a lion </a>than a lamb this season, and we all were wrong.&nbsp; Some of us picked them to win the World Series, while others picked them to only just limp into the Division Series.&nbsp; Perhaps we let our hopes dictate our picks too much,&nbsp;but I'm sure I will do the same thing next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I put more time into the Cubs this year than I have in any other.&nbsp; That time spent is partially due to this blog and podcast, but I also want to have been on board the whole time when they finally do it.&nbsp; Right now it is hard to imagine spending the same amount of time next year and having it end up the same way, but that's what I'll do.</p>
