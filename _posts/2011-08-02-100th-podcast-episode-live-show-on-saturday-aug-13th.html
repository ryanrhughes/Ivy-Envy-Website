<p>We are in our third season of podcasting about the Cubs and next weekend,  the 100th episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast will be recorded.  It seems like just yesterday we were doing our first episode, recording with a ragtag mix of awful microphones, two broken mixers, cables everywhere and no real idea what we were doing.  We still won't know what we're doing on our 100th episode, but we'll be light-years ahead as far as technology goes.  </p>
<p>Next Saturday night, August 13th, at 7pm CST, we will do a live show for the 100th episode.  We experimented with a live show a few months ago and took some of your phone calls.  We've done some research and messed around with things to improve the live show and we thought this would be a fun way to celebrate the milestone.  The main reason for doing it live is for all of you to be involved.  We want your phone calls and we want to talk Cubs (or whatever else) with all of you.  </p>
<p>This live show will be a step up from our last one.  We will be broadcasting video.  We will have a webcam mounted so you'll be able to hear the speech slur and see the bottles and cans pile up around us on the patio.  Plan to be on the road or out-and-about that night?  That's ok, if you have an iPhone,iPad or Android phone, you will be able to listen to the show on your mobile device.  </p>
<p>If you plan to view or listen from our website, you'll se a "Live Broadcast" tab at the top of the page.  Click on that and you'll have a few options.  You'll see a video player, click "play", grab a beverage during the 30 second commercial and then you'll be able to see and hear the broadcast.  </p>
<p>If you have slow internet or don't want to look at our ugly mugs, there will be a Mixlr audio player underneath the Ustream video player.  Then, under both of those will be a chat.  It's quick and easy to register and you'll be chatting in seconds.  One of us will be monitoring the chat to talk about what's being said.  However, we'd really like for you all to call in. </p>
<p>This will be different than our regular shows.  We've put in a lot of time and work to get to the 100th episode and the Cubs are giving us nothing else to celebrate, so we plan to have a good time.  </p>
<p>There will be more information coming.  We will have something(s) to give away...maybe a contest or two.  We'll see how it all falls in place.  </p>
<p>It should be a fun evening, so crack open a Hamm's/Old Style/Kurt's fancy beer and have a good time with us.  </p>
