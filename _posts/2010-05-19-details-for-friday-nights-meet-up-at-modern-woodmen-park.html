<p>Some of us from Ivy Envy will be going to Modern Woodmen Park in Davenport, IA to watch the Peoria Chiefs (Cubs Single-A affiliate) play the Quad Cities River Bandits (Cardinals Single-A affiliate) this Friday evening.</p>
<p>We can meet-up down on the Picnic Plaza area before the game.&nbsp; That is right along the Chiefs' bullpen and it's a cool spot to watch the team warm-up.&nbsp; They will have a couple of things going on that night at MWP.&nbsp; They are saluting the 1985 Bears and it will involve the Super Bowl Shuffle in some way.&nbsp; Also, they will have fireworks afterwards, so the kids enjoy that quite a bit.&nbsp; The park in general is kid-friendly, so bring the family.</p>
<p>But come on down, and if you have any questions, email me: corey@ivyenvy.com</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.ticketreturn.com/prod2/Buy.asp?EventID=46000" target="_blank">buy tickets here</a> or at the box office before the game.&nbsp; We are buying bleacher seats and they are general admission.</p>
