<p>I think that every sports team has its share of embarassing fans.&nbsp; We find ourselves wishing that these people would show some maturity, respect, and moderation.&nbsp; Cards fans everywhere should be wishing that this guy <a id="more"></a><a id="more-86"></a>would shut his hole.&nbsp; It is always tough to see a longstanding member of your team playing for the enemy.&nbsp; But to hate them "as a human being?"&nbsp; Edmonds is probably happy to just being playing at this point and to be still making a living.&nbsp; This scenario is reminiscent of being a fan of a particular band and then hanging a scarlet "S" for "sellout" around their necks when one of their songs shows up in a commecial.&nbsp; Sure, there are those players like Ernie Banks who love the city they play for with great abandon, but I'm guessing a large majority of the&nbsp; players out there are just happy to be making money doing what they love regardless of locale.</p>
<p>On the topic of embarassing fans-- Many people seem to think that the Cubs have some of the worst fans in baseball, including our friends at <a href="http://firstorderhistorians.wordpress.com/2008/05/22/the-chicago-cubs-have-the-worst-fans-in-baseball/#more-378" target="_blank">FOH</a>.&nbsp; I already stated my position on this issue above.&nbsp; I'd be interested to hear what some of our readers think.&nbsp;</p>
