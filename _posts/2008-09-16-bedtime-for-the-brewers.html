excerpt: "With fifteen innings of no-hit ball pitched by Lilly and Zambrano over the
  past two games, the Cubs are riding a growing wave of confidence into the postseason.&nbsp;
  Now all they need is to beat one of the best pitchers in the game tonight to feel
  unstoppable.&nbsp; The bats seem to be coming back to life as well.\n\nI feel a
  little bad for the Astros having to play two games in Milwaukee that were supposed
  to be home games for them.&nbsp; Mike and Mike were asking whether there could've
  have been any other better options for an alternate site for the Cubs-Astros series.&nbsp;
  They suggested nearby Round Rock (AAA affiliate) or the Rangers' stadium.&nbsp;
  It is a good point, but if the Astros had won even one of the two games (or even
  got a few hits for that matter), no one would probably be having this conversation.\n\nDid
  anyone else hate that the anchor on ESPN kept referring to Zambrano as Zam-BRAN-o
  (bran as in \"Raisin Bran\") during their highlights of his no-hitter?&nbsp; "

  content: The Cubs should be able to harpoon this whale since he has managed to beach
    himself. The sun is hot and his skin is quickly drying out. The whale reference
    is a good one considering the Brewers have guys like Prince Fielder and Carsten
    Charles Sabathia taking the field.

<p>With fifteen innings of no-hit ball pitched by Lilly and Zambrano over the past two games, the Cubs are riding a growing wave of confidence into the postseason.&nbsp; Now all they need is to beat one of the best pitchers in the game tonight to feel unstoppable.&nbsp; The bats seem to be coming back to life as well.</p>
<p>I feel a little bad for the Astros having to play two games in Milwaukee that were supposed to be home games for them.&nbsp; Mike and Mike were asking whether there could've have been any other better options for an alternate site for the Cubs-Astros series.&nbsp; They suggested nearby Round Rock (AAA affiliate) or the Rangers' stadium.&nbsp; It is a good point, but if the Astros had won even one of the two games (or even got a few hits for that matter), no one would probably be having this conversation.</p>
<p>Did anyone else hate that the anchor on ESPN kept referring to Zambrano as Zam-BRAN-o (bran as in "Raisin Bran") during their highlights of his no-hitter?&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-228"></a>Also, I love that they threw out this meaningless statistic: Zambrano is also the "first pitcher whose last name begins with a 'Z' to throw a no-hitter."&nbsp; That's like saying that Milt Pappas was the first pitcher to pitch a no-hitter after having an omelet for breakfast.&nbsp; Well, I guess they have to fill their broadcast hour somehow.</p>
<p>On the mound tonight:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><em>I will strike your ass out; then I will read you Green Eggs and Ham</em></p></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">It doesn't matter who your manager is for the final twelve games... you have to play the Cubs in six out of the twelve.&nbsp; If the Cubs can pull off the win tonight, then I will begin to be openly optimistic again.&nbsp; Thunder Matt's Saloon's preview of the game tonight is entitled "<a href="http://thundermatt.com/2008/09/time-to-harpoon-whale.html" target="_blank">Time to Harpoon a Whale</a>."&nbsp; Plenty of disparaging comments are also made about USC in their NFL weekend wrap-up post which makes me like that site even more.</p></p>
