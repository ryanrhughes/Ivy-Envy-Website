<p>If you are within driving distance of Peoria, you might want to consider a trip to see the Chiefs play this weekend.  The Chiefs have taken the first two games of a series with the Cedar Rapids Kernals (Angels) and thanks to some solid pitching, have won five of their last six games.  Chiefs pitchers have thrown three straight shutouts, including a 5 2/3 inning outing from Gerardo Concepcion in which he only allowed 2 hits and earned his second win of the year.</p>
<p>Javier Baez has also settled in against Midwest League pitching.  After 10 games, Baez is hitting .324 with 2 HR and 6 RBIs.  Baez also has a double, a triple and three stolen bases.  Kevin Capie writes for the <a href="http://www.pjstar.com/blogs/capie" target="_blank">Peoria Journal Star</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/kevincapie" target="_blank">tweeted</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The only player I've heard at this level who's Batting Practice consistently sounds like Baez with contact off the bat was Pujols in 2000.</blockquote></p>
<p>It should be an entertaining weekend at O'Brien Field.  Here's what's on the agenda for the weekend:</p>
<p><u><strong>Friday vs. Cedar Rapids (Angels)</strong></u><br />
<a href="/uploads/2012/06/Maddon-shirt.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2012/06/Maddon-shirt-150x150.jpg" alt="" title="Maddon shirt" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7460" /></a></p>
<p>The first 1000 fans through the gates at O'Brien Field for the 7pm game will receive a Joe Maddon t-shirt.  Maddon, current Tampa Bay Rays manager and two-time AL Manager of the Year winner (2008, 2011), was the manager of the Peoria Chiefs in 1984.  I bet you are thinking "Wow, I bet he managed some of those players that went on to form the great 1989 Cubs team."  No, the Chiefs were an Angels affiliate at that time and there's not a name I recognized on <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/team.cgi?id=21765400" target="_blank">the roster</a>.  </p>

The highlight for anyone close to my age would be the scheduled appearance of Dennis Haskins, more commonly known as Mr. Belding.  If you go and are able to meet Mr. Belding, I'm sure he'd appreciate it if you didn't walk up and say "Hey! Hey! Hey! What is going on here?!"  He's probably heard it a few times.  I would suggest imitating his laugh, though.<br />

<p>Speaking of Saved by the Bell, my wife was once in a bumper car ride and got sandwiched between Mark Paul Gosselaar and Tiffany Amber Thiessen.  For a pre-teen girl in 1990, it doesn't get much better than Zack Morris and Kelly Kapowski.  </p>
<p><u><strong>Saturday vs Kane County (Royals)</strong></u><br />
Mr. Cub himself, Ernie Banks, will throw out the first pitch and sign autographs at Saturday night's game.  His appearance is part of the 10th Annual IPMR Legend at the Ballpark Night.  There will also be fireworks after the game.</p>
<p><u><strong>Sunday vs. Kane County (Royals)</strong></u><br />
This is a Family Fun in the SUNday game.  All childrens (12 and under) tickets are $2.  Children may play catch on the field before the game and run the bases after the game.  The kids will also appreciate the appearance of Disney characters at the game.  </p>
<p>The first 1000 fans at the game will receive a 2012 Peoria Chiefs team baseball card set.  The Chiefs players will be stationed in different areas of the concourse and sign autographs for fans after the game.  I've seen other minor league teams do this and it's been two or three players.  Last year, I took the family to one of these games and I don't believe there was a single Chiefs player not signing autographs.  If you're into the autograph thing, this would be a good chance to snag a signature from Concepcion and Baez.  </p>
