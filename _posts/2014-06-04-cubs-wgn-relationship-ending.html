  content: I saw somewhere that this only saves the Cubs $2 million? Can that be right?
    If so, then I'm against the move. If it saves the Cubs significantly more, then
    I'm totally behind it, as long as we keep Pat Hughes. I'm still sad, though. WGN
    and the Cubs have been together my whole life.

  content: I'm not sure what Dawn means about "saving 2 million," but if they are
    going to get an extra 2 million for an AM feed, that's a pretty freakin' good
    deal. It's a bummer if it is going to directly affect how you follow the Cubs,
    but the Ricketts are doing the right thing. This whole organization was in need
    of a complete overhaul and they are getting it done. The Trib were terrible owners
    and all of this should have been done long ago. If it had been done that way,
    nobody would have noticed the nickel&amp;dime changes as they happened, but because
    the Ricketts have to fix EVERYTHING, it is catching everyone off guard. I love
    it. In 5 years, when all of this change is in the past, people will see the great
    job that is being done right now.

  content: The crux of the matter is how baseball is consumed.   There are outlets
    besides over-the-air broadcasts and teams know it.  If you're not in range of
    the radio signal or if your cable provider doesn't have the channel, you're not
    out of luck.   You might have to pay for the games on the internet,  but you do
    have the option of seeing them.

  content: They're moving to 780(no more traffic on the 8's).  It's also suggested
    that the deal wbbm/cbs has taken with the cubs is unsustainable and won't
    last very long.

  content: Boo.  I am officailly noe the old man talking about the way things used
    to be.  I can see the logic behind it being on CBS they will have more comprehensive
    cross format coverage.  But I was hoping WGN would come out on top and turn into
    the old TBS and Cubs games would be on nation wide all year.

  content: The Cubs and WGN are synonymous.  This Is a 90 year relationship that has
    been woven into the fabric of all who call themselves Cubs fans. The word is that
    WGN opted not to match WBBM's deal. It is a downright shame and an outright travesty.
    If GN bails on the Cubs, then I bail on GN. That will end a 30 year listening
    relationship, all the way back to when I was a kid. Childhood memories of my grandfather,  the
    Cubs, and WGN are vivid in my memory. What an unnecessary end to what should be
    a lifelong business relationship.

  content: what is wrong with tradition? being sentimental? since when do we not hold
    past tradition in regard?  so tired of changing traditional things that were cornerstones
    like the wgn broadcasts, the man run scoreboard, the ivy it's sad to see these
    things come to pass, there is no reason other than pure GREED to make these changes.  just
    sad that younger generations don't appreciate tradition and sentimental things.

  content: I couldn't disagree more, Ernie Cavista.  I think it can be pretty easily
    proven that there is a correlation between losing baseball and some of these traditions.  I
    like tradition, but I don't like keeping traditions "just because".  The world
    is changing, media consumption is changing, baseball is changing.  Wanting to
    catch an organization up to the rest of baseball is not greed, it's responsible
    ownership.

  content: By the way, Ernie Cavista, the man-run scoreboard and ivy aren't changing.  Both
    are protected as landmarks and it's things like that which will give Wrigley Field
    and the Chicago Cubs that historical vibe that many fans love.

    I'm hungry for a championship. Little changes like this mean nothing. I love Ron Santo but maybe now we won't have to hear "this is the year" and "go cubs go" when we could lose 100 games this year.
    If Wrigley renovation doesn't start soon I wouldn't mind seeing a retractable roof stadium in the burbs if it would generate more revenue and increase timetable for championships

  content: Not only do kids not listen to radio, they don't watch cable tv. Both the
    radio and tv deals needed to end for both parties. If the Cubs and MLBAM want
    to grow their young fan base it will be through YouTube and other new media.

<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cubs-and-WGN-radio.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cubs-and-WGN-radio-300x300.jpg" alt="Cubs-and-WGN-radio" width="300" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10032" /></a>The rumors about the Cubs leaving WGN Radio have been flying for months and more intensely the last week or so.  Today, the <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/27855702-761/cubs-may-announce-parting-with-wgn-radio-on-thursday.html#.U46IkJRdVdJ" target="_blank">Cubs will announce</a> the end of this 90-year relationship and a new 7-year deal with CBS/WBBM.</p>
<p>With the entire WGN relationship ending (remember that WGN-TV <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20140530/NEWS01/140539978/wgn-america-to-drop-chicago-sports" target="_blank">recently announced</a> they are ending their coverage of Chicago sports in favor of original content like their new series "Salem".  </p>
<p>These are big changes for Cubs fans that have tuned into 720AM and WGN-TV for Cubs baseball for their entire lives.  Add in the drastic proposed changes to Wrigley Field and a massive rebuild directed by new ownership and a new front office and it's easy to see the traditionalists frantically trying to pump the brakes on this thing.  </p>
<p>What does the Cubs move to WBBM mean?  Not much, really.  Instead of tuning into 720AM, you'll need to turn the dial a little further to right to 780AM.  For those of us that don't live in the Chicago area, WBBM's signal isn't quite as strong as WGN, so you will need to rely on the nearest <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/schedule/affiliates.jsp" target="_blank">Cubs Radio Network affiliates</a>, which probably provides a stronger signal than WGN and is the way you listen to Pat and Coom Dawg anyway. Yes, Pat Hughes and Ron Coomer will remain in the booth and call Cubs games.  </p>
<p>Also, the way that we consume baseball has changed.  We had a discussion on our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> last week about the Cubs leaving WGN.  Jeff, a friend of several of us Ivy Envy guys, expressed his concern that the Cubs relationship with WGN Radio and TV would impact the Cubs' reach and ultimately their ability to attract new fans.  </p>
<p>I understand that sentiment, but I think us older folks need to realize that kids are no longer huddled over a radio, turning the dial and magically finding the signal that is broadcasting Chicago Cubs radio.  Kids aren't flipping through tv channels on a summer afternoon. They are growing up in a world where MLB At-Bat and MLB.tv is more the norm.  I'd be shocked if 10% of teenagers even know what AM Radio is.  </p>
<p>I'm perfectly fine with this change.  Even though I can pick up Cubs baseball on 2 or 3 radio stations, I tend to listen to games though the MLB At-Bat app.  Media consumption is changing.  Baseball is changing.  The Cubs are changing.  And really, these (and all of the other changes) are long overdue.  </p>
