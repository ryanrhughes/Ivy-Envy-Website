<p>Andy, Brian and Corey are in-studio and Jeremy joins in through Skype on this episode.  The Cubs are playing decent, but the negatives are pretty glaring.  </p>
<p>We start things off by discussing Ryan Dempster and his incredible start to 2012.  How long can he continue pitching like this?  When we he finally crack and push his Canadian politeness to the side and unleash his fury with the bullpen?  What will the Cubs do with Dempster, since this is a contract year?</p>
<p>Marmol wastes another great starting pitching performance and it earns him a demotion out of the closer's spot.  We discuss this situation.  LaHair continues to tear it up.  Corey predicts we've seen Randy Wells' last game in a Cubs uniform and the other guys weigh in on that.  </p>
<p>Then, John from <a href="http://acubsblog.com" target="_blank">Wasting Away In Wrigleyville</a> comes on to give some possible explanations on what may have happened to Marmol.  He also talks about the WAIW Pub Crawl, which is next Saturday.</p>
<p>Kurt isn't on the episode, but sends in a scary stat and we pick a winner for this week's caption contest.  </p>
<p><strong>Next weekend, our live broadcast will not be on Saturday, but instead on Sunday (May 13) at 8pm CST.  </strong></p>
