<p>Let's start out by saying that after a great series in Arizona, the Cubs didn't play very well in L.A.&nbsp; Even though they put some runs on the board, the pitching was pretty atrocious overall.&nbsp; With that being said, what the hell was up with this crew of umpires?&nbsp; Brian Runge especially appeared to get a number of calls wrong, and some of these calls weren't even that close.&nbsp; His strike zone was ridiculously fluid on Thursday (which led to the ejection of Byrd), and he made a few obviously erroneous calls at first as well (which led to the ejection of Silva).&nbsp; You know the calls weren't too close when the commentators kept using the phrase "to the naked eye."&nbsp; Muskat's article contained a Piniella quotation that summed it all up--</p>
<blockquote><p>This crew here, I don't think I want to see them the rest of the year," said Piniella, who was ejected Saturday by umpire Jerry Layne, also because of a call at first. "I usually don't complain about umpires, but we never got a call all weekend.</blockquote><br />
Frustratingly enough, Piniella seemed content to go out to the field and have some polite words with the ump.&nbsp; On Saturday he was finally ejected, but it was still kind of maddening that it took him that long.&nbsp; At some point, a manager has to get kicked out along with his player, especially if the call made by the umpire is a game-changing mistake.&nbsp; I thought he should've done the same thing on Sunday with the two missed calls at first base.&nbsp; Thank God for the All-Star Break.</p>
