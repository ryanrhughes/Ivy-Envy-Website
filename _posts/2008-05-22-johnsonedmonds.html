    Felix, Felix, could you do as well?

    C Patterson, could you do as well?

    Of course, of course, but we're young and inexperienced, so Des Moines we go.

<p>It looks as though the Cubs will face three lefties this weekend, so Reed Johnson will get the starts in Center Field.&nbsp; We'll see how he does after sitting on the bench four days in a row.&nbsp; I somewhat understand this platooning in CF,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-81"></a>but it's not ideal for one of the guys to sit on the bench for a whole series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edmonds got this last series in Houston as the Cubs faced three right-handed pitchers.&nbsp; Edmonds responded by batting .090 with 1 base hit and 1 walk.&nbsp; Not exactly the offensive production you want from an outfielder.&nbsp; And now he'll sit on the bench until at least Monday, maybe longer depending on who the Dodgers have on the mound.&nbsp; The only positive thing I can mention about Edmonds in this last series is that he only struck out once.&nbsp; Given his massive upper-cut swing, that's pretty good.&nbsp; From what I've seen, I don't expect Edmonds to be around long.&nbsp; You could give me that $250,000 and I would only have one less hit than him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reed Johnson might be a little rusty for this series, but I think we might see a little more production.</p>
