    Watched the end of the Rangers/Cubs games last night. In the 8th inning Josh Vitters failed to put the effort into catching a popup in foul territory that if he had given even a marginal amount more effort he could have easily caught. Even the Rangers announcers commented about how he should have easily been able to get the out. This led to the Ranger tieing the game in the 8th and winning it in the 10th.
    I realize it's spring training and guys don't wanna go all out (unless your names Darwin Barney). But for a guy like Vitters who has stagnated and needs to make an impression, that play summed up where he is going. Low effort and destined to spin dirt in the minors. I think Cubs fans have moved on from these two and there is a lot to be excited about in Bryant, Baez, Soler, Olt etc... But it's still painful to see a guy like Vitters show how much of a bust he is.

<p>Most Cubs fans have grown impatient with former top prospects Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters.  This is partially because of the amount of time that it is taking the former 1<sup>st</sup> rounders to get to the majors because of their struggles at the upper levels of the organization, but also because of the new bumper crop of talent in Javier Baez, Kris Bryant, Albert Almora and Jorge Soler.  </p>
<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vitters_jackson.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/vitters_jackson-300x200.jpg" alt="vitters_jackson" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9164" /></a>On Tuesday, the <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-03-18/sports/chi-josh-vitters-and-brett-jackson-optioned-20140318_1_josh-vitters-brett-jackson-cubs" target="_blank">Cubs optioned Jackson and Vitters</a>, along with Arodys Vizcaino, Zac Rosscup and Christian Villanueva to AAA Iowa.  </p>
<p>The struggles for Brett Jackson and Josh Vitters continued, primarily in the form of strikeouts.  Vitters has been especially awful.  A slash line of .111/.340/.111 is not going to convince anyone you need to be anywhere but the minors.  In his 18 at-bats, Vitters has 11 strikeouts.  Vitters, a 3<sup>rd</sup> baseman, will go to Iowa and continue to work on his issues at the plate, as well as a defensive move to the outfield.  Vitters has just a handful of games in experience in the outfield.  </p>
<p>Brett Jackson's strikeouts have been what has kept him from owning the center field spot for the Cubs.  When he came up with the Cubs in 2012, his strikeout rate was literally off the charts.  (<a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/graphs.aspx?playerid=9632&position=OF&page=4&type=full" target="_blank">From Fangraphs</a>)<br />
<a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-19-at-11.25.49-AM.png"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-shot-2014-03-19-at-11.25.49-AM.png" alt="Brett Jackson Strikeout Rate" width="600" height="350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-9161" /></a><br />
Jackson batted .208/.402/.530 in Spring Training this year.  When Jackson did make contact this spring, he hit the ball hard.  Out of his 5 hits, 3 were extra-base hits - a double, a triple and a home run.  He knocked in 8 runs in his 24 at-bats.  The issue?  Strikeouts, of course.  In those 24 at-bats, Jackson had 12 strikeouts.  </p>
<p>At this point, it's difficult to imagine Vitters and Jackson making it up to, let alone impacting, the major league team.  I think most Cubs fans have moved to prospects more deserving of their adoration.  While it is frustrating to see the once top prospects of the organization struggle, I think Javier Baez, Kris Bryant and Mike Olt have shown us the difference between 2010 Cubs top prospects and 2014 top prospects.  </p>
<p>Arodys Vizcaino, Zac Rosscup and Christian Villanueva were also sent to Iowa.  Vizcaino has not thrown in an MLB game since 2011, but this winter we heard that Vizcaino was throwing in the upper 90s after recovering from Tommy John surgery.  This spring, Vizcaino threw 3 innings, with no runs on two hits.  He walked one and struck out two.  It seemed possible that Vizcaino could make the big league team out of Spring Training, but the Cubs apparently want to play it save and let him ease back into things.  With a seemingly solid bullpen (as solid as a Cubs bullpen can be), this makes sense.  </p>
<p>If Mike Olt's shoulder issues heal up and he breaks camp with the Cubs, Christian Villanueva will get the starting job at 3<sup>rd</sup> base in Iowa to start the 2014 season.  While the organizational depth at shortstop has everyone intrigued right now, with every home run Mike Olt hits, the future at 3rd base seems even more interesting.  With Olt (#14 on Cubs.com prospect list), Bryant (#2), Villanueva (#11) and Jaimer Candelario (#9), the Cubs will have options.  </p>
<p>Zac Rosscup started off the 2013 season and eventually made his way up to the Cubs.  He'll start this season in Iowa and will be an arm that the Cubs will most likely call up at some point this season.  He did not get adequate time in AAA last year and it'd be nice to see his walk rate go down a bit.</p>
