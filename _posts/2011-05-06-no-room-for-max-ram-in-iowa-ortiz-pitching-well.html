<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/uploads/2011/05/MAXRAM_shirt.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5207 aligncenter" title="MAXRAM_shirt" src="/uploads/2011/05/MAXRAM_shirt-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a></p><br />
The Cubs announced the release of catcher Max Ramirez on Friday. The move isn't too surprising considering the Iowa Cubs had been carrying three catchers after the promotion of Wellington Castillo to AAA from A Daytona. I'm sure Max Ram was sweatin' when he heard that Castillo would be joining the team. The return of INF Jonathan Mota from the seven-day DL means our hopes of seeing an Aram Ram and Max Ram combo on the Chicago Cubs are over. Now the world will never have the chance to wear the t-shirt I designed with plans of putting them on a huge pole and selling around Wrigley.</p>
<p>The Iowa Cubs are mimicking the performance of their major league counterparts. They're 13-14 with a few bright spots. <a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?pos=&amp;sid=t451&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=428642" target="_blank">Lou Montanez</a> is hitting .371, <a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?pos=&amp;sid=t451&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=542999" target="_blank">Tony Campana</a> .345 and <a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?pos=&amp;sid=t451&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=445933" target="_blank">Bryan LaHair</a> .333. The starting pitching has been pretty bad with three ERAs over 8.00. <a href="http://web.minorleaguebaseball.com/milb/stats/stats.jsp?pos=P&amp;sid=t451&amp;t=p_pbp&amp;pid=150009" target="_blank">Ramon Ortiz</a>, signed by the Cubs on April 10, seems to be the only pitching bright spot in this rotation. In five starts he's 1-1 with a 3.45 ERA and has thrown 28.2 innings. With 5.64 innings per start (Z is at 6.31 and Dempster 5.42) and a pretty good ERA, it seems likely that we'll see Ortiz in Chicago if the Cubs see any more pitching injuries or struggles. This is looking like a good move by Hendry. There's little risk involved and if he continues to pitch well he'll provide the <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4964" target="_blank">insurance that Hendry was looking for</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5-9-11 EDIT</strong>. The Cubs upped their insurance policy a little more on Monday. LHP Doug Davis was called up from high-A Daytona and added to the active roster. Davis was signed &nbsp;in April with Ramon Ortiz. Ortiz is not currently on the active roster so it appears the Cubs may use Davis before Ortiz, likely because they currently have no lefties in the rotation...and, no, I'm not counting James Russell as part of the rotation.</p>
<p>From the I-Cubs press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div>
<div><em>Davis made one start for the Daytona Cubs this season on May 5. He pitched six and two-thirds innings of shutout baseball, striking out seven batters and only allowing two hits. Davis is expected to make his first start for Iowa on May 10 against Colorado Springs.</em></div><br />
