On this episode, we recap John Baker Day. We all three decided this may be our best baseball game experience.  It was an incredible day and thanks to all of you that made it so special. </p>
<p>This episode was recorded before Sunday night's Cubs/Mariners rubber-match.  We talk about the first few games and discuss Arrieta.  Is he back on track or are there some pretty alarming indicators?  </p>
<p>It appears that Joe Maddon wants to keep this team fresh and adding Matusz to the rotation and resting Rizzo on Saturday are signs that he wants this team well rested for September and beyond.  We also talk about how much Maddon may use Chapman.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have made some roster moves, sending La Stella to Iowa and calling up Coghlan.  The three of us feel that it's difficult to see Coghlan with a long-term place on this team.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a Scary Stat of the Week and we read several Internet Muscle Flexes.  </p>
<p>Lauren live broadcasted most of the John Baker Day event on Periscope and if you'd like to watch that, go to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/2016bakervideo" target="_blank">http://ivyenvy.com/2016bakervideo</a></p>
