<p>A new addition to our site this year is our game-chat.&nbsp; We are launching the chat today for the first Cubs Spring Training game.&nbsp; The Cubs will be taking on the Oakland A's at 2pm.&nbsp; Unfortunately the game is not on tv (explain that decision, WGN and CSN), but it will be broadcast on WGN Radio. We thought that a game-chat might be a nice little place for fans to congregate while watching and listening to the Cubs.&nbsp; A large part of being a Cubs fan is the community.</p>
<p>We have mentioned this on the podcast, but interest in Spring Training games is kind of half-hearted, so if you come into the chat for a game in the next month and it's dead, don't write it off.&nbsp; We expect the chat to kick into full gear on on April 1st.</p>
<p>You can enter the chat by clicking on "Game Chat" at the top of the page, below the Ivy Envy header.&nbsp; So come on in and join the community.</p>
