<p>So the Bradley situation has come to an end.&nbsp; The Cubs got rid of their "clubhouse cancer" and picked up a pitcher with pretty terrible stats.&nbsp; But at least Silva will hopefully be friendly with his teammates and even possibly talk to them in the locker room.&nbsp; Maybe even snap someone in the ass with a wet towel... you know, bonding-type, morale-boosting activities.</p>
<p>A couple other sites had some pretty humorous takes on the situation.&nbsp; Check out <a href="http://thundermatt.com/2009/12/milton-bradley-watch_18.html" target="_blank">Thunder Matt's Saloon</a> and <a href="http://wastingawayinwrigleyville.blogspot.com/2009/12/problem-bradley-for-problem-silva.html" target="_blank">Wasting Away in Wrigleyville</a>.</p>
