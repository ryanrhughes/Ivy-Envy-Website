<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Jeremy evaluate Mike Quade's managing in the first two weeks of the 2011 season.  We also take a look at how Casey Coleman and James Russell are doing, filling in for Andrew Cashner and Randy Wells.  We take a look at a few Cubs players that are struggling early in the season and look at the "man" on the other end of the spectrum, Starlin Castro.  Kurt introduces a new regular segment, we choose a winner of our Facebook Photo Caption Contest and award the first Asshat of the Week in 2011.  </p>
