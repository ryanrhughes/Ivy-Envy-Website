<p>More talk on the tragedy that is the 2009 Cubs season.&nbsp; We are also joined by my neighbor, Dave.&nbsp; He wanders over to offer to ask if he can mow without disturbing us and discusses the Cubs with us a little.</p>

<p>Also, Matt from WrigleyBound.com tells us which minor leaguers we can expect to impact the Cubs in 2010.&nbsp; And Tim is called out and given two weeks to apologize for his actions.</p>
