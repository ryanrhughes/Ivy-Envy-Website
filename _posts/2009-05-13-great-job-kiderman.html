<p>"A high deep drive... Bobby Scales with his first career homer!"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night's game was pretty great, and the highlight for me was seeing Bobby Scales hit that home run.&nbsp; He has spent over 10 seasons in the minors prior to this first stint in the majors, and he has worked as a substitute teacher in the off-season to supplement his minor-league income.&nbsp; It feels great to see a guy like that succeed.&nbsp; I saw on SportsCenter today that Bobby Jenks makes 6500-some dollars per pitch (he was fined $750 for throwing behind Kinsler--lol).&nbsp; Imagine how much money&nbsp;players like Soriano or Bradley make for every swing of the bat.&nbsp; After the ball sailed into the bleachers, Scales sprinted around the bases, and I said, "Slow down and revel in the moment!"&nbsp; My wife replied, "Maybe that is his way of reveling in the moment."&nbsp; Keep it rolling, Bobby!</p>
<p>Some other Cubs miscellany:</p>
<p>-Fukudome quietly had another great game, and it is very nice to see the Cubs get some extra-base hits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Freel's quotation when asked how it feels to be now playing for the Cubs: "Thank ya Jesus!"&nbsp; He went on to say, "If there was any more happiness, there'd have to be two of me."&nbsp; Wow, is playing in Baltimore that bad?&nbsp; Have fun, Joey.</p>
<p>-Zambrano is going to do a rehab start in single A.&nbsp; Can you imagine being one of those guys who has no prayer of making it to the majors&nbsp;and batting against Zambrano?</p>
