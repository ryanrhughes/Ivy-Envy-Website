<p>When coming to the Cubs, Theo Epstein and Jed Hoyer must have looked at the team as a clean slate, but also a muddy mess.  The Cubs continued their (Jim Hendry) clean-up moves yesterday by trading Tyler Colvin and DJ LeMahieu to the Colorado Rockies, in exchange for Ian Stewart and Casey Weathers.  </p>
<p><strong>Tyler Colvin</strong> was clearly going to be lost in the mix in the outfield.  I thought the Cubs might give him a chance to be the #4 outfielder in Spring Training, but left-field was not going to be his once David DeJesus was signed.  The Rockies are hoping the Denver thin air will help Colvin return to his 2010 form of 20 homeruns.  They are praying they don&rsquo;t see the 2011 Colvin, when he batted .150 with 6 HR and 20 RBI. </p>
<p>I think the scouting report is out on Colvin and he&rsquo;d have a hard time hitting 20 HR in zero gravity, let alone Denver.  You have to make contact before you can knock a ball out of the park.  But good luck to Colvin.  Any player that was impaled in a Cubs uniform deserves some respect.</p>
<p><strong>DJ LeMahieu</strong> will compete for the 2nd base job for the Rockies, and can serve as a utility infielder.  LeMahieu got in 37 games with the Cubs last season, with most of his starts at 2nd base.  LeMahieu has a .317 batting average in the minor leagues and at the age of 23, he could be a good piece for the Rockies.  </p>
<p><strong>Ian Stewart</strong> is the most intriguing part of this trade.  After struggling through injuries and being demoted in 2011, Stewart&rsquo;s value is significantly lower than just a few years ago, when he was considered to have a lot of potential.  While he has struggled at the plate, Stewart has been solid on defense and will probably be an upgrade from Aramis Ramirez, in the field.</p>
<p>Stewart remains under control of the Cubs through 2014 and will make about $3 million in 2012.  At 26 years of age, Stewart is entering those &ldquo;prime years&rdquo; that Epstein and Hoyer value so greatly.  With this move, the Cubs have added another left-handed batter to the starting line-up.  Stewart is also a gain of $13 million at 3rd base with Ramirez declining his option with the Cubs.<br />
<strong><br />
Casey Weathers</strong> was in on this trade, as well.  Weathers will be 27 years old and has made it as high as AA in the Rockies system, as a relief pitcher.  He pitched in 44 games in 2011, with an ERA of 5.32.  </p>
<p>This was a trade that consisted of players that the original team did not have much use for.  So why not ship them to someone that might have a spot for them? This is just all mop-up duty.  We are seeing the Cubs buying low on guys that they believe are prime for solid seasons after injury and if you guess right, you get good deals.  I&rsquo;m beginning to think we&rsquo;ll see a lot more clean-up than championship building &ndash; and that&rsquo;s probably what a smart President and General Manager would do right now.   </p>
