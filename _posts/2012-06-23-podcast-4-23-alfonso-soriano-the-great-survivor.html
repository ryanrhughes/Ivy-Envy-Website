<p>Bob and Brian join Corey in the studio and Kurt phones in for this episode.  We start things off by discussing the frustration many fans feel with Alfonso Soriano and their reactions to his failure to run out a dropped line drive in the Red Sox series.</p>
<p>Starlin Castro made an incredible catch in the White Sox series and we talk about the play and use it as an opportunity to talk about a future position change and Castro's defense in general.  </p>
<p>Corey wrote a post earlier in the week voicing his displeasure with Randy Wells and talk about the disappointing route that his career has taken since the 2009 season.  </p>
<p>We are possibly only days away from Anthony Rizzo being called up to the Cubs.  We make predictions on his call-up date and have a little segment we called "The Rizzo Reality Check".  We tell you why you shouldn't expect Rizzo to come up and duplicate his AAA numbers.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener submitted questions on the most recent draft and what happens to players that don't sign, our feelings towards Darwin Barney and his future with the organization, MLB black-out rules and the idea of Matt Garza being traded away.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a scary stat that has multiple layers and we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
