<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1071" title="White Flag" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/White-Flag-300x244.jpg" alt="White Flag" width="275" height="224" />After a slew of great games recently, the Cubs returned to their unwatchable form today as they lost to the Brewers 11-2.&nbsp; Many had positive expectations for this game given the play of the Cubs this past week, and Lou was finally switching up the lineup.&nbsp; But Harden had one of his worst outings of the year today, surrendering seven earned runs in two innings pitched.&nbsp; The offense was still fairly anemic as well.&nbsp; Despite the new-look lineup, the Cubs left 12 on base.&nbsp; Soriano, now batting sixth, made Lou look like he knew what he was doing when he came up to bat with the bases loaded in the first.&nbsp; He then proceeded to ground out.&nbsp; The only runs for the Cubs came on Milton Bradley's two-run homer.&nbsp; Overall, it was a very ugly game, but the Cubs still have a chance to take 3 out of 4 from the Brewers.</p>
