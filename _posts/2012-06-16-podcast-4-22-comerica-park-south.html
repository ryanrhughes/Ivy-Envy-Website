<p>Andy and Corey are joined in the studio by a first time guest, talking about her first Cubs game.  Kurt joins us from his place in Iowa.  Andy and Corey discuss the Tigers vs. Cubs games they witnessed this week and you hear about the things that stood out to a 5-year old in her first trip to Wrigley.  </p>
<p>The Cubs sign Jorge Soler and we discuss the next piece of the Cubs team of the future.  Rudy Jaramillo is dismissed by the Cubs and we look at what did and did not lead to this move.  Carlos Marmol is back in the closer role and Ryan Dempster may have played his last game in a Cubs uniform.</p>
<p>Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and we pick a winner for the photo caption contest. All of this and more on this week's episode of the Ivy Envy Podcast.  </p>
