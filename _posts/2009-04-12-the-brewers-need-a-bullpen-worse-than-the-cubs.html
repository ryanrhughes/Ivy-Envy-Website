<p>It was a chilly evening in Illinois last night and I was the only person left out at the backyard bar when, in the top of the 9th, Soriano hit his game-winning 2 run shot.  I'm one of those Cubs fans that does not give up on a game.  It's not necessarily because I expect a comeback, but because I force myself to endure the pain.  Everyone else headed inside after the Brewers went up 5-3.  Nope, this is my team and I will suffer with them.  I'm an Opus Dei Cubs fan and losses are my mortification.</p>
<p>We discussed in <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=540">this weekend's Ivy Envy podcast</a> that the Cubs bullpen is not in good shape right now.  However, it was nice to be reminded that the Brewers' bullpen is in even worse shape.  I don't hate the Brewers or Brewers fans but it was really nice to see the look of despair on their faces in the 9th inning.  I thought, "Hey...that's OUR look!"  They can have it.</p>
<p>The Cubs bullpen looked bad last night.  The Brewers bullpen looked worse.  It'll be interesting to see how the Cubs relievers perform in the next week.  Obviously, the number of walks needs to go down or else Lou's physician is going step in to protect his patient's health.  The walks are what's putting the Cubs in bad positions.  Once they can cut those down, then they can look at the other issues the 'pen has.</p>
