<p>Rudy Jaramillo was fired as the Cubs hitting coach Tuesday. He will be replaced on an interim basis by minor league hitting coordinator James Rowson. At first glance, it looks like the Cubs are putting the blame for the horrendous offensive performance of this team on Jaramillo. If we dig a little deeper and take Theo Epstein's word for it, we can see that the main reason for the change is philosophical.</p>
<p>Jaramillo was hired in October of 2009 after 15 seasons with the Texas Rangers. From '96 to '04 the Texas Rangers ranked in the top five in the American League in batting average, runs scored, slugging percentage, home runs, and hits. And players loved working with him.</p>
<p>The numbers were a little different with the Cubs. Team batting average has been steady at around .250. Strike outs have been over 1,200 in '10 and '11 and walks have been decreasing. When he took over in '09 the Cubs walked 592 times and were 9th in the league. In 2010 and 2011 that number fell off to 479 (22nd in league) and 425 (29th) respectively. Those numbers add up to a similarly decreasing OBP. .332 in '09, .320 in '10, .314 in '11 and just .305 this year.</p>
<p>Does that make him a bad hitting coach? Not at all. His philosophy seems to be that you have to hit to get on base and you have to swing, with good mechanics, to hit. That is evident by the numbers and also by the development of Starlin Castro. Last year Castro led the NL with 207 hits and had a BA of .307, but took just 35 walks. His OBP was .341. By contrast, Carlos Pena, a better offensive player by sabermetric measures, had 111 hits and hit just .225, but took 101 walks. His OBP was .357 even with his 161 strike outs. </p>
<p>This year Starlin has just 6 walks in 286 plate appearances. Castro's approach probably hurt Rudy more than the team's poor offensive numbers. Starlin's horrendous <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/batting/_/league/nl/sort/walkToStrikeoutRatio/type/sabermetric/" target="_blank">sabermetric</a> stats must really frustrate Epstein. He is last among all hitters in BB/PA at 0.23, his secondary average (SECA, a more complete offensive statistical measurement) is just .198, and his isolated power (ISOP, essentially SLG-BA) is .135. (If Castro is Theo's sabermetric nightmare, LaHair is his dream. He is in the top ten in almost all meaningful categories. BB/PA, .122; SECA, .415; ISOP, .275; RC27, or runs created per 27 outs, 7.67; AB/HR, 14.3).&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some of that approach is just who Starlin is as a hitter, but young players need to be coached. As the Cubs rebuild and develop young talent, they need a guy who is going to teach patience at the plate as much or more than swing mechanics.</p>
<p>Jaramillo will land another job soon enough. This is a good move for the Cubs and Jaramillo. He's a really good coach who is probably better suited for an AL team with a lineup full of veteran hitters, not young projects. Sounds like the Texas Rangers. It's too bad for Rudy that the Rangers have been leading in nearly every offensive category since he left and have been to two World Series'.</p>
