<p>Last year, we decided to do a live Ivy Envy Podcast recording at Twenty Sports Grille in Moline.  <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1300" target="_blank">We had a great time and really enjoyed the crowd participation</a> and hanging out with fellow Quad Cities Cubs fans.&nbsp; You can hear that podcast episode <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1291" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><center><a href="/uploads/2010/04/Ivy-Envy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2470" title="Ivy Envy" src="/uploads/2010/04/Ivy-Envy.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="300" /></a></center></p>
<p>We are going to do more events this year.  Some will be podcast recordings and some will just be meet-ups during Cubs game broadcasts.  You will find those listed in the "Live Events" tab at the bottom of our logo on the website.&nbsp; Our first event in 2010 will be on April 26th at Twenty Sports Grille.  We&rsquo;ll get things started at 6pm with a podcast recording.  The Cubs will host the Washington Nationals at 7pm and Twenty is a great place to watch the game with a television everywhere you look and that audio of the games played over their sound system.</p>
<p>We will have some stuff to give away, courtesy of Twenty and Budweiser.  Come on down at 6pm to put your name in the bucket for the prizes.  Twenty will have pints of Bud and Bud Light for $2.</p>
<p>Twenty is located in downtown Moline, IL at 1405 5th Avenue.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d love to hang out with you and watch the Cubs, so come on down.</p>
