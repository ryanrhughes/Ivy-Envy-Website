<p>The nomination period for the <a href="http://podcastawards.com" target="_blank">9th Annual Podcast Awards</a> is underway.  In this video, I look back on our 5 seasons of podcasting on the Chicago Cubs and show you how to nominate us for the awards.  </p>
<p>Simply go to <a href="http://podcastawards.com" target="_blank">http://podcastawards.com</a>.  Fill in "Ivy Envy" and "http://ivyenvy.com" in the Sports Category.  We would also appreciate it if you would nominate the podcast that Andy's wife and my wife do, <a href="http://mommyscocktailhour.com" target="_blank">Mommy's Cocktail Hour</a>.  </p>
<p>While we will be up against the big players in the sports category, like the ESPN podcasts.  A handful of independent podcasts are nominated every year and I'd love the opportunity to represent our listeners at the Podcast Awards ceremony.  </p>
