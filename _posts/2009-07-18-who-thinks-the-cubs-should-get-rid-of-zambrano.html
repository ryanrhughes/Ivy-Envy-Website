  content: I'm embarrassed to say that's my Chicago sports blog.  I figured bringing
    on a White Sox fan as a contributor would appeal to a larger Chicago fan base
    (mostly those with bad credit).  Unfortunately he has taken it upon himself to
    try to "fix" the Cubs as well.  Gotta give him credit for giving an honest good
    faith effort, though.  I don't think it was meant maliciously, he's just wrong.  Really
    really wrong.

  content: Yeah.. thats a terrible idea.  I heard Rockridge has a great pitcher this
    year.. maybe we could send Z to them.. He's been tearing up the high school scene
    this year..

  content: Props to Stormin Norman for owning up to having mistakenly employed a south-sider
    to write on his blog and for putting him in his place with his follow up comments.
    Gotta keep the clubhouse dissent to a minimum.

<p>This guy does:</p>
<p><a href="http://notqualifiedtocomment.com/2009/07/congrats-carlos-now-leave-ted-you-can-stay.html">Not Qualified to Comment Blog</a></p>
<p>And who does this guy say the Cubs should replace Zambrano with?&nbsp; Martin Perez.&nbsp; Oh, you haven't heard of him?&nbsp; That's because he's a guy that, as the writer of this blog says, "has pitched well at Single A this year"...for the Rangers.</p>
<p>Anyone care to defend the idea of ditching your ace for a Single A prospect?</p>
<p>Cubs fans are embarassing.</p>
