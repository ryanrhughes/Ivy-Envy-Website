<p>After being handcuffed by the new restrictions on the 2012 MLB Draft, the Cubs ponied up the largest bid for free agent Cuban defector, Jorge Soler.  Soler defected from Cuba in 2011 and has been eligible for free agency since Saturday June 2nd.  The reports are that the 9 year deal is worth $30 million.  </p>
<p>Soler is a solid 6-foot 3 224lb 20 year old outfielder that Keith Law projected would have probably been a top 5 pick in this year's draft.  He is described as a four-plus tool player.  </p>
<p>Development with Soler will probably start slowly.  He hasn't played competitive baseball in over a year because of his residency issues.  Perhaps we'll see him in Peoria later this season.  </p>
<p>The Cubs had shown interest in Yoenis Cespedes in the off-season.  He ended up signing with the Oakland A's.  Soler is six years younger, which makes him more appealing, especially considering the Cubs will not be contending for anything for the next few years.  This gives Soler plenty of time to develop.  </p>
<p>The Cubs appear to be stocking their system with players that will be ready to advance to the major league level in two or three years.  The money that would have been spent on Prince Fielder or Albert Pujols is much better spent developing a more well-rounded organization, which in the long run can potentially lead to more success at a lower price.  </p>
<p>While the potential roster of the Cubs is unproven and developing in the minor league system, the future line-up is beginning to take shape.  We could be looking at an outfield of Albert Almora- Brett Jackson - Jorge Soler from left to right.  It's an interesting stage that the organization is in and I think it'll be fun to see how these prospects pan out.  </p>
