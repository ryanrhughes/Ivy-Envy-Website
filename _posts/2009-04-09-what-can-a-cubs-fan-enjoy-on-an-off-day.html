<p>I expected myself to be bored out of my mind tonight with no Cubs game.&nbsp; I'm feeling pretty calm and relaxed, though.&nbsp; I have kind of been on baseball/Cubs overload in the last week.&nbsp; So I kick back, turn on the Brewers vs. Giants game and pray the game goes into a ridiculous amount of extra innings since the Brewers have to jump on a plane after the game and fly to Milwaukee to face the Cubs tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>This is the first Brewers broadcast I've seen on their network.&nbsp; So us Cubs fans are supposed to be afraid of their fans' numbers as they "overtake" Wrigley Field and make it Miller Park South.&nbsp; Their fans think this goes beyond last fall's Brewers/Amtrak promotion.&nbsp; Apparently, this massive legion of fans has decided to jump off the Brewers bandwagon.&nbsp; Tonight, I saw an on-air promo during the Brewers broadcast.&nbsp; If you buy a large pizza, you get a <a href="http://www.whgonline.com/content/brewers09.php">free ticket to a Brewers game</a>.  </p>
<p>Dear Brewers fans,<br />
Why don't you focus on defending your home turf by actually buying tickets before you go to take over Wrigley Field.  I've seen you Wisconsin guys and I know you like your pizza.  But you should consider actually supporting your team.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Corey </p>
