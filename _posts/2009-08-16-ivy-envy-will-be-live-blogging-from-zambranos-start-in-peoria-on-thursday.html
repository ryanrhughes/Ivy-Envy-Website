    we can quit our jobs and I can join you for a road trip to P-town. If we only
    had more itunes ratings.

<p>This Thursday evening, I will get to witness in person, for the first time, Carlos Zambrano pitching.&nbsp; I am making the trek down to Peoria for Zambrano's rehab start and I'll be live blogging on the site during the game.&nbsp; Those same blog entries will be sent to our Twitter, so you can follow us on there and get the "groundbreaking news".</p>
<p>I'm really looking forward to this.&nbsp; I got seats 10 rows behind homeplate, so I will have an up-close view of Zambrano mowing through the Clinton Lumberkings.&nbsp; I do own a Lumberkings hat, but I won't be sporting it that evening.&nbsp; I don't wear it often because it has a strong smell of the corn processing and rendering plants in Clinton.</p>
<p>I just wish the Midwest League let the pitchers hit because I can only imagine Zambrano would be swinging for the fences in Peoria to put on a show.&nbsp; Given Zambrano's track record with success after DL stints, or any injuries at all, I'm looking forward not just to seeing him in Peoria, but getting back to the Cubs.</p>
