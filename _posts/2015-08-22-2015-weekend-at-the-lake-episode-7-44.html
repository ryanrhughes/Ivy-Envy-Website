<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>This recording took place at our annual Ivy Envy Weekend at the Lake.  We talk about the events of the weekend so far and the events we have planned for the rest of the weekend.  </p>
<p>We talk about the need for Cubs fans to be comfortable with talking about the playoffs.  That leads us into a discussion about if we'd like to see the Cubs play the wild-card game, if they have the opportunity to participate in that game.  </p>
<p>We answer some listener questions that involve the Cardinals roster, Cubs throwback jerseys and the players currently on the Cubs roster that will be free agents at at the end of this season.</p>
