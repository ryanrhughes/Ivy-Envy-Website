<p>Andy, Corey, Kurt and Ryan discuss a few aspects of the Jim Hendry firing.  Jeremy joins us just long enough to introduce himself before Skype fails us.  </p>
<p>In the second half of the show, we welcome Brian Bedo from www.miCubs.com on to talk about the effects of the Hendry firing on the Cubs' minor league system.  We also discuss the Cubs' performance in the 2011 draft with Brian.  </p>
