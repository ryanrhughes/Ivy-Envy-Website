  content: Ronnie pulls out some gems...no argument there.  My favourite is his classic
    "gaaaahd" when Theriot boots a routine ball, Sori Ks, or anyone in the bullpen
    throws a ball.  Good times.

<p>Day games in the Spring means that I forced to listen to the radio broadcasts of Cubs games.  At some point, we will have a discussion on the podcast about broadcasters.  It&rsquo;s a conversation that is long overdue.  I am not a Ron Santo fan.  I understand why people enjoy listening to Ron, but I like a little analysis from my color commentary.  But since I listened to the radio broadcast, I&rsquo;d like to throw out a couple of Ron&rsquo;s quotes from today&rsquo;s game.  If you listened to the game, I&rsquo;m sure you cocked your head in confusion just as I did when he uttered them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t ill-afford to leave a runner on base.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;Wil Nieves &ndash; his real name is Wilbert, and that&rsquo;s short for Wil.&rdquo;</blockquote></p>
<p>With that last quote, Judd Sirott seemed stunned and speechless.  Judd is not nearly as seasoned as Pat Hughes in maneuvering Ron through a conversation.  Pat is the only tolerable aspect of the radio broadcast and Judd just really isn&rsquo;t that good.  Neither he nor Ron can describe a play.  I had no idea what Marlon Byrd did in the field that both described as one of the finest plays they&rsquo;d ever seen and would surely be the top play of the day in baseball.  All I could figure out is that it involved a back-handed catch and maybe it was behind him.</p>
