  content: "I'm sensing some heavy frustration in your last couple posts. I'm with
    you there. The optimism is getting harder to summon. We're quickly approaching
    the halfway point with very little to be happy about.\r\n\r\nI think they need
    to make a deal. Not sure for who, but a change is needed. Maybe the Indians will
    deal Derosa. ESPN says he's likely to be dealt.\r\n\r\nhttp://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=stark_jayson&page=rumblings090618\r\n\r\n\"This
    guy's a winner,\" said an executive of one of many interested teams. \"He just
    has that presence of a winner out there. If somebody grabs this guy, he'll be
    a difference-maker down the stretch.\" Asked what position DeRosa ought to play
    -- second, third or left field -- the same exec laughed and replied: \"All of
    them.\"\r\n\r\nI've never heard DeRosa complain about where he hits or even where
    he plays the field. Oh and Jason Marquis has won 9 of 14 starts...in Colorado.
    Not a great offseason for Mr. Hendry."

  content: To be fair, you say we have very little to be happy about, but with as
    poorly as the Cubs have played, they're still very within reach of the division
    lead.  The Central is still there for the taking, and further more, the Cub's
    pitching has been pretty solid overall.. Give or take a Kevin Gregg pitching experience
    or two.

  content: "I agree with you that the Cubs are not out of it yet, but you will always
    be way more optimistic than myself.  \r\n\r\nI was watching a replay of the Cubs/Sox
    series from last year and at that time, the Cubs had won 14 in a row at home...or
    something like that.\r\n\r\nI don't see this year's team doing anything like that,
    at all.  There has not been a point yet this year that made me feel any bit as
    optimistic about the team's chances as I did last year."

  content: "[...] last series against the Tigers indicates that my last post, &#8220;Cubs
    return to form in Atlanta&#8220;, was pretty accurate.&nbsp; I missed the entire
    series, driving to California.&nbsp; Part of me is [...]"

<p>The Cubs jumped down to Atlanta for one game and were shutout for the sixth time this season.&nbsp; Four of those have come in the last 30 games.&nbsp; Last night, the Cubs had 10 hits with 12 total baserunners when you include Fukudome's two walks.&nbsp; And once again, another good pitching performance is wasted.</p>
<p>I was afraid the sweep against the Indians was just a fluke.&nbsp; The Indians are terrible and their pitching is atrocious.&nbsp; And even in that series, 2 of the games went into extra innings.&nbsp; I don't think the Cubs have looked solid since the series where they swept the Padres at Wrigley in the middle of May.&nbsp; The bats came alive against the Indians, but with that pitching up there in Cleveland, it was hard to get too excited.&nbsp; The Cubs had to count on Kerry Wood for those two victories.</p>
<p>So I think these next two weeks are pretty important and they will give us a good idea of where this team stands.&nbsp; The next two weeks include the Tigers, White Sox, Pirates and Brewers.&nbsp; I think if the Cubs do any worse than 8-5, they may be in trouble.</p>
