<p>I don't know what it is about this guy, but he feels the need to trivialize the accomplishments of every opposing player.&nbsp; Jim Edmonds has become a valuable piece of the Cubs.&nbsp; So Ozzie must downplay Edmonds' accomplishments <a id="more"></a><a id="more-103"></a>and speak like a cocky fool that has nothing to back up his words.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>"Jim is Jim. Jim is not going to scare me," Guillen said. "I will pitch to him another time. He just hit a couple of home runs. Good for him."</blockquote><br />
I haven't seen managers spend as much time bashing other teams and players.&nbsp; I can't wait until the White Sox wise up and chase him and his .264 career batting average out of town.&nbsp; Oh and by the way Ozzie, Jim Edmonds hit&nbsp;more&nbsp;homeruns in one game&nbsp;than you did in 11 of your 16 seasons.</p>
<p>I don't want to take down my "W" flag.&nbsp; Go Cubs, Sweep the Sox!</p>
