<p>I completely missed this news and I'd like to thank Kevin for the e-mail, alerting me.  Matt Murton was called up to the Rockies from AAA Colorado Springs.  Murton was batting .411 with four homeruns, six doubles and 19 RBI's in 18 games.  Matt has also stolen five bases.  I'm really happy to see Matt get back up the big leagues and his ability to hit multi-base hits has obviously returned.</p>
<p>I may have to pick up a Murton Rockies shirt when I drive through Denver to Los Angeles this summer.  Also, if he is still with the Rockies in July, I will tempted to return to the hell-hole referred to as Dodger Stadium when the Rockies visit.</p>
<p>The Marlins just put up half a dozen on the Cubs in the 10th and the Cubs will soon be under .500.  Why comment on that when there is something good happening in baseball?  Congrats, Matt.</p>
<p>Speaking of tearing things up in the Minors, how about Jake Fox in Iowa?&nbsp; In 20 games, he's batting .429 with an OBP of .500.&nbsp; Sure, that's impressive.&nbsp; But how about this:&nbsp; 12 HR, 8 doubles, a triple and 31 RBI's...in 20 games!</p>
