  content: That column reminds me of something that John Marx would write.  Sports
    writers should leave humor to comedians.  Amateur bloggers can attempt all the
    humor they want, though.

<p>Milton Bradley has the media and Cubs bloggers abuzz with his recent statements about Cubs fans.&nbsp; I'm not going to get into the specifics of what he said because I'd just be repeating what's been reported on all over.&nbsp; I have not had ill feelings towards Milton Bradley all season and I continue to support and defend him, as a player.&nbsp; I can't really defend him as an individual because I don't know him.</p>
<p>As for his cries of racism, I don't know.&nbsp; I've never heard anything racist directed at a baseball player and I've never heard anything racist said at Wrigley.&nbsp; But I doubt a day goes by that I don't hear someone say something racist, so I can't say that it would surprise me that some douche sitting in the right field bleachers would get toasted and in the safety of a crowd and his frat boy buddies and decide to try to get a reaction from the most volatile player on the field.</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why some Cubs fans heckle him the way they do.&nbsp; I don't think it has anything to do with his performance.&nbsp; I remember reports from Mesa in March that Cubs fans were heckling him.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, Bradley performed well in Spring Training.&nbsp; So what's the deal here?&nbsp; Do people heckle because they're drunk idiots and want a reaction?&nbsp; Do people heckle because a guy performs poorly?&nbsp; I'm not a heckler.&nbsp; I am not going to hide behind a brick wall with ivy that will protect me from a dude that could snap me in half.&nbsp; I am not going to heckle a player that is in a hitting slump.&nbsp; The worse I will do is "boo" a guy that plays lazy.&nbsp; But it would take quite a bit for me to do that.&nbsp; So part of what baffles me about it all is that it's just not in my nature to heckle, so I can't get in the head of a heckler.</p>
<p>Milton Bradley is what he is.&nbsp; He can't keep his cool.&nbsp; He obviously has a history of feeling victimized.&nbsp; Why did Cubs fans expect anything different?&nbsp; Bradley does not come across, to me, as a guy that does not care.&nbsp; I've seen him run out a routine ground-ball.&nbsp; I've seen him visibly frustrated when he fails at the plate.&nbsp; I think he's a guy that cares about his performance and wants to win baseball games.&nbsp; When he signed with the Cubs, he stated that he does not handle losing well.&nbsp; The 2009 Cubs aren't a good team for him, then.&nbsp; It's been a season of disappointment and losing as often as they have won.</p>
<p>So why do fans feel the need to bait him?&nbsp; He's one of our guys.&nbsp; He may make a few bone-headed plays, but he shows effort.&nbsp; He's not having his best season.&nbsp; But injuries were a huge concern for Bradley.&nbsp; Last year, he played in 126 games, which was more than he had played in 5 seasons.&nbsp; He could potentially play more games this year than he ever has in his career.&nbsp; He's a good baseball player that has had a rough stretch.&nbsp; The stupid thing is this...he's had a great month.&nbsp; He's playing well, yet he's heckled by fans.&nbsp; This leads me to believe the hecklers are idiots looking for a reaction rather than critics of his performance.</p>
<p>Since the All-Star Break, Bradley has raised his Batting Average almost 30 points.&nbsp; In the month of August, he batted .308 and had an OBP of .427.</p>
<p>Current 2009 Stats:&nbsp; BA - .266&nbsp; / OBP - .395&nbsp; / HR - 12 / RBI - 37 / BB - 66</p>
<p>Career Average:&nbsp; BA - .279 / OBP - .373 / HR - 11.5 / RBI - 43 / BB - 45</p>
<p>So the way I see it, Bradley is performing pretty closely to how he has throughout his career.&nbsp; With the way he is hitting the ball, I would expect that his batting average would continue to rise in September and he could be above his career average at the end of the season.&nbsp; I've heard a lot of people key in on his low RBI total.&nbsp; I was pretty surprised to see that it's actually pretty consistent with the rest of his career.</p>
<p>I've heard the argument that Milton Bradley is not earning his $7 million.&nbsp; I have had the opinion in the past that a player needs to earn their salary and I've been upset if a guy gets a huge contract and then their production drops.&nbsp; Milton Bradley had a career year last year and the Cubs rewarded him with a big contract.&nbsp; Three years may not seem big, but for Bradley, it is.&nbsp; They knew his history and they knew his career average numbers, but they obviously hoped he would repeat his 2008 production.</p>
<p>So Milton Bradley had an average season in 2009.&nbsp; He managed to stay healthy, which is a feat in itself.&nbsp; But Cubs fans place unrealistic expectations and then heckle him when he is being what he's always been.&nbsp; It makes no sense to me.&nbsp; Now if you want to talk about players earning big money and not producing, let's look at Alfonso Soriano.</p>
<p>Soriano is making a cool $17 million.&nbsp; Let's look at his numbers:</p>
<p>Current 2009 Stats:&nbsp; BA - .243 / OBP - .305 / HR - 20 / RBI - 55</p>
<p>Career Average:&nbsp; BA - .279 / OBP - .326 / HR - 31 / RBI - 84</p>
<p><em>I took out the first two seasons of his career with the HR and RBI because he only played in 31 games between the two seasons.</em></p>
<p><em>(By the way, Soriano's BA in August was .185)<br />
</em></p>
<p>So, Soriano makes about 2.5 times Bradley's salary and look at those numbers.&nbsp; I don't agree with the talk that the Cubs should cut Bradley loose.&nbsp; According to Tim McCarver on the Fox broadcast on Saturday, there's no way Bradley will be back next year.&nbsp; I am not a huge Milton Bradley fan, but he's done for us what he has done throughout his career.&nbsp; I would hate to see the Cubs eat a contract and I would like to see him back next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't really understand those that are critical of his overall performance.&nbsp; I don't think he's imagining the heckling.&nbsp; I've read enough anti-Bradley stuff to know that he's hearing it from the fans at Wrigley.&nbsp; I don't doubt that he's hearing it around town, too.&nbsp; Cubs fans have a right to be frustrated with the team this year, but I feel the anger towards Milton Bradley is misdirected.&nbsp; I like his OBP and although he doesn't handle himself in the most rational way, he shows fire and effort every day.&nbsp; I'll take that over the loafer in left field.</p>
