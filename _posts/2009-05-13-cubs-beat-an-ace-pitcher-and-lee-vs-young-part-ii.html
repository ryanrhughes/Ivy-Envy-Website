<p>It was really nice to see a bruised and battered Cubs team win last night's game in a manner that you're supposed to when facing an ace pitcher.</p>
<p>1.<strong> Count on your pitcher to keep things close. </strong>Harden pitched a good game.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Attempt to force a high pitch count to push the starting pitcher out early.</strong> Peavy had 111 pitches in six innings.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Get timely hits and take advantage of bad pitches.</strong> Milton Bradley's 2 run homerun.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Beat up on the bullpen once you force the starter out.</strong> The Cubs added three runs in the last two innings to pad their lead.  By the way, I know Andy has already dished out his appreciation, but let's hear it for Bobby Scales.</p>
<p>Tonight's game should be interested.  What I would like to see is Derek Lee do more than his 1 walk, 3 strikeout performance last night.  I'm not really being critical of Lee.  He's proven that he's willing to play through injury and if there was a time that this club needs a veteran to play through injury, it's right now.  Maybe facing Chris Young tonight will give Lee that shot in the arm he needs.  If you don't recall, they have a bit of a history.</p>
