<p>Like most baseball fans, I was shocked when the Cardinals hired Mark McGwire as their hitting coach.&nbsp; I think the case can be made that McGwire's cheating (and Sosa's, while we're at it) impacted baseball on a much larger scale than any betting Pete Rose did.&nbsp; Of course, MLB knew exactly what was going on when scrawny 20 year olds ended up looking like body-builders in their mid 30's, so they aren't going to take any strong stance against the players that took steroids.&nbsp; They will rely on the sports-writers to keep those guys out of the Hall of Fame.&nbsp; But that doesn't keep those guys out of baseball.</p>
<p>My current disappointment is with Cardinals fans.&nbsp; I would expect something like this from a club that is managed by Tony LaRussa, but I was surprised to hear how<a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/sports/stories.nsf/cardinals/story/1F3B1BF75DBD14E2862576AF00174831?OpenDocument"> Cardinals fans greeted McGwire</a> at the Cardinals' Winter Warm-up.&nbsp; If the Cubs were to hire Sammy Sosa, in any capacity, I could not get behind it at all.&nbsp; I would expect a heavy dose of heckling if Sosa was to be introduced at the Cubs Convention.</p>
<p>But Cardinals fans cheered for Mark McGwire as he was introduced at their Winter Warm-up.&nbsp; Many were wearing t-shirts that said "Welcome Back Mac".&nbsp; I really can't understand how they could rally around him.&nbsp; Earlier in the week, I was happy to hear former Cardinals first baseman <a href="http://mlb.fanhouse.com/2010/01/15/jack-clark-rips-into-mark-mcgwire-and-steroid-users/">Jack Clark voice his opposition</a> of McGwire, by stating that players that used steroids are cheaters and fakes.&nbsp; How did Cardinals fans react when Clark was introduced?&nbsp; He was "dusted by boo's" according to Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</p>
<p>I have spoken with two Cardinals fans in the last week about all of this, since McGwire's sit-down with Bob Costas.&nbsp; Both were not in favor of McGwire being hired, but didn't seem too passionate about it.&nbsp; In this whole situation, I've realized I'm trying to do something impossible.&nbsp; I am trying to understand the rationale of the typical Cardinals fan.</p>
