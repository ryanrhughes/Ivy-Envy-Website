The Cubs started the 2nd half of the 2016 season with a series win over the Rangers.  On this episode, we talk discuss the series.  </p>
<p>Kyle Hendricks is having a break-out season and we spend quite a bit of time looking at why he's being successful without a high strikeout rate or low walk rate.  </p>
<p>The Cubs have not been at full strength for quite a while and we look at when injured players might re-join the team.  Kurt shares a Szczur stat in his Scary Stat of the Week segment and we read some Internet Muscle Flexes.</p>
