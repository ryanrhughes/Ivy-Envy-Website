  content: "If you're a guy that tucks in his T shirts you're probably pretty used
    to getting beat up anyway.  \r\n\r\nI understand wearing a guy's jersey, but wearing
    another dude's picture on your shirt is just weird unless it's Chuck Norris.  \r\n\r\nThese
    things are insufferably ugly"

<p>Here at Ivy Envy, we try to be responsible fake journalists.  After I <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=4937" target="_blank">posted about the horrendous Joey Votto shirt</a> on Monday, Brian over at <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com" target="_blank">Chris Sabo's Goggles</a> quickly directed me to this shirt.<br /><br />
<a href="/uploads/2011/04/Soriano-Shirt.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4950" title="Soriano Shirt" src="/uploads/2011/04/Soriano-Shirt.jpg" alt="" width="470" height="470" /></a></p></p>
<p>The Soriano shirt is $15 bucks cheaper than the Votto shirt.  It could be because Votto was the NL MVP last year and has a bright future ahead of him. &nbsp;It could be because the Votto shirt is double-sided. &nbsp;Or it could be due to the fact that way more Reds fans will jump all over these t-shirts, only to promptly cut off the sleeves to look as much like Larry the Cable Guy as possible.  God help me if I see a Cubs fan wear one of these Soriano shirts.</p></p>
