We talk about the game and the festivities.  There were things we think the Cubs nailed and some things they fell short with (besides the on-field product).  </p>
<p>Corey's brother, Patrick has been a White Sox fan for 23 years.  When he said he'd like to go to the game, he shared that he was prepared to leave the White Sox for the Cubs.  In this interview, you will hear from Patrick.  You will hear what has prompted this decision and after weeks of deliberation and witnessing a tremendous collapse by the Cubs on Wrigley Field's 100th birthday, is he ready to call himself a Cubs fan?  </p>
<p>Justin Ruggiano went down with an injury in the game on Wednesday, we talk about his injury and the players that the Cubs called up this week - Zac Rosscup and Neil Ramirez.  The Cubs currently have a 13 man pitching staff and it seems like they'd likely bring up another outfielder.  We look at the options in Iowa and give our preferences.  </p>
<p>We go through some listener questions, give Kurt's Scary Stat of the Week and pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
