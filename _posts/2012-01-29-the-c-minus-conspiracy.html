<p align="center">I.</p><br />
It was a beautiful summer day&mdash;the kind of day that left me with no choice but to go to a game at Wrigley.&nbsp; The only problem was that I didn&rsquo;t have tickets, but I knew how to solve it.&nbsp; We pointed ourselves in the direction of Waveland and Sheffield.&nbsp; Scalpers could always be found hanging out there.&nbsp; A last minute ticket was going to be more expensive than usual because the Cubs were having a good season for once.&nbsp; However, they had struggled a little in late July and now in August.&nbsp; I was hoping they would snap their current four-game losing streak today.&nbsp; Young Kerry Wood would be trying to stop the bleeding for the Cubs, and the way he had pitched this year instilled confidence in me and the fans.&nbsp; I was still kicking myself for missing his twenty-strikeout game earlier this season.&nbsp; My favorite player, Mark Grace, was having a great year, and it was pretty fun watching Sammy Sosa hit a boatload of homers.&nbsp; Rod Beck was saving almost every close game which was a huge upgrade over last year&rsquo;s Adams-Rojas closing tandem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need tickets?&rdquo;&nbsp; The brusque voice drove me from thoughts of Rod Beck&rsquo;s majestic facial hair and into the present.&nbsp; I stopped watching the ball hawks shuffling their feet and adjusting their gloves in anticipation, and my eyes fixed on the source of the voice.&nbsp; A bearded man stood in front of us, and he looked shadowed, despite standing in direct sunlight.&nbsp; I kind of enjoyed the effect, but Sandra closed herself off to the unseemly character, pretending to scan the line forming by the bleacher entrance.&nbsp; The haggard man in front of me clutched several tickets surreptitiously in his hand, a worn Cubs cap pulled low over his forehead.&nbsp; It was the kind of cap that proudly displayed a sweat high-water mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um, yeah.&nbsp; Two please.&rdquo;&nbsp; He held out the tickets, and I started to pull out some cash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty bucks,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whaat?&rdquo;&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t think I heard him right.&nbsp; I expected to have to detach my arm and give it to someone to obtain tickets, and these were for pretty good seats on the first base side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was puzzled by the price and a little suspicious, but I handed him a twenty anyway.&nbsp; I pocketed the other bills I expected to have to part with.&nbsp; Last minute, cheap tickets on a beautiful day didn&rsquo;t just happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said, pressing the tickets into my palm.&nbsp; I noticed there was another small card there along with the tickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;&nbsp; I asked, but he was already swept away by the throng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Check into it!&rdquo; I heard him yell through the crowd.&nbsp; I pocketed the tickets and fingered the blue cardstock that was slightly larger than a business card.&nbsp; I flipped it over, expecting to see some lame entrepreneurial crap, but filling the expanse of the flipside were no words, just a symbol I recognized from my high school days.&nbsp; It was a C-minus-looking symbol, but the &ldquo;C&rdquo; part was a Chicago Cubs &ldquo;C.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to look it up online when we get home,&rdquo; said Sandra, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get in there, Sean!&nbsp; I think batting practice is already happening, and I want to watch Glenallen Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might be the only one,&rdquo; I replied, still curious about the mysterious card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget the card!&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go get some food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We wandered around the corner onto Addison, and through the front gate.&nbsp; We bought nachos and beer and were about to head to our seats when I saw Sandra just standing and staring.&nbsp; She looked like I would have to reboot her.&nbsp; I grabbed the food and walked over by her to see why she seemed to be spacing out.&nbsp; In front of her, tucked off to the side of one of the vendors was a small, inconspicuous door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the heck is your&hellip;&rdquo; My words stuck in my throat because there, right above a small brass knob on the gray door, was the exact same symbol that was on the business card--a C-minus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; said Sandra.</p>
