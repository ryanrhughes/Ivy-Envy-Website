<p>When I was younger, I had the childish notion that somehow my presence at a sporting event would give the team I happened to support a better-than-usual chance to win. &nbsp;The Cubs won the first four or five times I went to see them, so why couldn't this idea be true? &nbsp;I had a knack for bending all my best wishes into metaphysical goodwill bombs that I mentally lobbed at the players. &nbsp; The team had done nothing to dispel these thoughts until the past few times I have gone to see them play.</p>
<p>My presence doesn't seem to help anymore. &nbsp;Maybe it is more of a hindrance than a help. &nbsp;Or perhaps the Cubs don't have even the minimum level of raw quality for this fan's sheer desire to mystically conjure winning play on the field, to animate their bodies to achieve excellence.</p>
<p>I am only going to be able to go to two games this year, and the first one was last night. &nbsp;The Cubs lost to the Tigers 8-4. &nbsp;I find that I still enjoy the experience, no matter the outcome. &nbsp;An evening at Wrigley is an evening well spent. &nbsp;As the sun set on a beautiful day in Chicago, I. . .</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">. . .didn't talk for the first inning, because I was stuffing my face with pizza.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. . .exchanged contended looks with my girl.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. . .listened intently as the young boy keeping score behind us helped an older man complete the part of his scorecard that was empty due to a restroom break.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. . .held my breath as Starlin Castro threw himself at a hard hit ball, snagged it, and threw out Miguel Cabrera in time.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">. . .cheered as the Cubs drove a couple balls into the gaps in the fifth inning.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I was going to mention some of the negative occurrences I saw, but it doesn't seem right at this point. &nbsp;It was a great day, and I look forward to helping the Cubs win when I return in August. &nbsp;Oh, and I almost forgot the upside-down Starlin Castro t-shirt we found at Strange Cargo. &nbsp;It was like finding an error-card underneath the bubble gum in a pack of Topps.</p></p>
