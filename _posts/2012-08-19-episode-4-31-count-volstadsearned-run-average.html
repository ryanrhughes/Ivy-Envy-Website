<p>Andy, Corey, Jeremy and Kurt talk about the upcoming Ivy Envy bus trip, which is next Saturday.  We also spend time at the beginning of the show talking about various off-topic conversations.  </p>
<p>We feel some frustration that Chris Volstad appears to be the scheduled starter for the game of our bus trip.  The theme of "crappy pitchers" continues for our bus trip, as last year we saw a Doug Davis start.  </p>
<p>Alfonso Soriano accomplishes a feat that only six players in MLB history have accomplished.  1,000 RBI, 400 doubles, 350 HR, and 250 stolen bases should impress us...and for a short period of time, it does.  The Cubs are reportedly close to locking up Starlin Castro for 7 years.  We're on board with that deal and discuss why it appears to be a good deal for all parties involved.  </p>
<p>We look at Brett Jackson's and Josh Vitter's progress since being called up and discuss what the next six months may look like for these guys.  </p>
<p>We read some listener submitted questions.  Nick from Virginia asks about the idea of trading Bryan LaHair and Bob from the UK wonders about big name free-agent signings and when that might happen for the Cubs.  </p>
<p>Kurt gives us a Volstad Scary Stat of the Week and we award the winner of the photo caption contest with a <a href="http://shop.mlb.com/product/index.jsp?productId=13156455&cp=2366583.2184764" target="_blank">The Essential Games of Chicago Cubs DVD Box Set</a>, courtesy of A+E Home Entertainment/MLB Productions.  </p>
