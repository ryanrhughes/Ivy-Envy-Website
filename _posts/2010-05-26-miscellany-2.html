<p>The Cubs came through last night with a 3-0 victory over the Dodgers.&nbsp; Kershaw is a tough pitcher and looked pretty sharp last night.&nbsp; Fortunately, Rafael Furcal's defense didn't.&nbsp; Kershaw only gave up one unearned run due to a Furcal error, and Lee's 2-run homer was off the bullpen.&nbsp; Dempster was his usual self last night--the only difference is he didn't make any mistakes late in the game that cost him.&nbsp; If his pitching performance had been any less dominant, the Cubs could have lost this game.&nbsp; Gorzelanny will have to have another stellar outing tonight if the Cubs hope to beat Billingsley, who currently is 5-2 with a 3.66 ERA.</p>
<p>-Fukudome has come in four out of the last six games as a defensive replacement late in the game.&nbsp; I know Piniella is trying to get players like Nady some playing time (and it seems to have helped Nady), but in doing so, there is a chance that Fukudome's bat could cool down.&nbsp; He is still hitting over .300.&nbsp; I'd like for that to continue.&nbsp; Oh, and part of the reason I bring this up is that tonight's starter was a righty, so you would expect Fukudome to start if we're so concerned about right-lefty matchups.</p>
<p>-Hey Joe, start Reed Johnson, you knuckleknob!</p>
<p>-How about that collision between Marlon Byrd and James Loney last night?&nbsp; I was surprised Loney's arm didn't snap off.&nbsp; Marlon Byrd is in my top 5 of players I would never want to have a collision with.&nbsp; Who is #1 you ask?&nbsp; Ted Lilly.</p>
<p>-How about Edgar Tovar's snag on a screaming foul ball near the bullpen?&nbsp; I'm guessing <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=tovar-001edg" target="_blank">this Baseball-Reference link</a> is the same Edgar Tovar.&nbsp; Do you ever wonder about the life of the bullpen catcher like I do?&nbsp; It seems like it would be a nice gig, especially after a baseball career that never took off.&nbsp; Check out the comments on <a href="http://www.toweldrills.com/2008/04/edgar-tovar.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.&nbsp; Ouch.</p>
<p>So anyway, if the Cubs can keep up the fire, we might see .500 soon!&nbsp; The upcoming schedule wants to dampen my enthusiasm, but I won't let it, damnit!</p>
