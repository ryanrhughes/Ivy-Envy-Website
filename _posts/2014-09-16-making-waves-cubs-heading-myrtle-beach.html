<p><a href="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9462" src="/uploads/2014/03/1280x1024_wallpaper_08-300x240.jpg" alt="cubs logo" width="300" height="240" /></a>Today the Cubs announced that they are moving beaches as they take the High-A club from Daytona to Myrtle.</p>
<p>After two decades in the Florida State League, the Cubs are headed to the Grand Strand and the more hitter-friendly, less rainout-prone Carolina League. The clubhouse at TicketReturn.Com Field has been home to current Cubs such as Mike Olt, Justin Grimm, and CJ Edwards over the years and is located just a mile from the fun of Ocean Avenue.</p>
<p>After a dominant run to the Midwest League title, many of the Kane County Cougars of 2014 seem poised to call South Carolina home next season. Myrtle Beach is a worthy host; certainly a player-friendly (and fan-friendly, while I&rsquo;m at it) place to spend a season with the Boardwalk just around the corner, food and drink aplenty and a more than bountiful collection of golf courses for the rare day off from the minor league grind.</p>
<p>Pelican&rsquo;s Chairman Hank Greenberg was once a part of the Nolan Ryan ownership group of the Texas Rangers and saw Myrtle Beach switch affiliations from Atlanta to Texas four years ago. As Bleacher Nation <a title="reported" href="http://www.bleachernation.com/2014/09/16/affiliate-shuffle-cubs-high-a-to-myrtle-beach-kane-county-uncertain-martarano-more/" target="_blank">reported</a> earlier today, Greenberg&rsquo;s son is now a part of the Cubs baseball operations department.</p>
<p>The move seems like a win for both parties, not to mention Cubs fans looking for a new vacation spot. The Cubs had a good run in Daytona, but a move away from the soggy Florida State League summers was surely a huge selling point for the development-first thinkers of Chicago&rsquo;s front office.</p>
