<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>We haven't had any significant injuries to discuss in a while and on this episode, the 271<sup>st</sup> of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we talk about the injuries to Castro and Rizzo.  September looked to be real exciting as a good portion of the line-up was comprised of players that could be long-term pieces for the team.  While we still get to see some of the young players, it is a bit disappointing that we won't get to see a line-up with them and the "veterans", Castro and Rizzo.</p>
<p>The rosters expand in September and we discuss the players that the Cubs have called up.  Two Cubs minor league teams are still in the post-season and we check in on their runs for championships.  We also can't avoid talking about Mike Olt in this conversation.  </p>
<p>It's common to hear people talk about the Cubs being a dangerous team because they are "playing loose."  We talk about this idea and explain why we don't really buy it.  We also spend some time talking about the popular opinion going around baseball that the Cubs are the surprise team for 2015.  Is it good to start putting premature expectations on this extremely young team?</p>
<p>Of course, we check in on Baez and Soler.  We go through a handful of listener questions, Kurt gives us a Scary Stat of the Week and we read some internet muscle flexes.</p>
