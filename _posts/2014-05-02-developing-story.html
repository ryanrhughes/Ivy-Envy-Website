<p><a href="/uploads/2014/05/Anthony-Rizzo-Starlin-Castro-Chicago-Cubs.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9850" src="/uploads/2014/05/Anthony-Rizzo-Starlin-Castro-Chicago-Cubs-300x168.jpg" alt="Anthony-Rizzo-Starlin-Castro-Chicago-Cubs" width="300" height="168" /></a>The most promising storyline for the 2014 Chicago Cubs organization was always going to surround development. I&rsquo;ve even been encouraging you to take a break from the struggling big league squad and <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/early-results-around-farm/" target="_blank">peek into the future</a>. With Arismendy Alcantara hitting over .300 in Des Moines, Kris Bryant mashing homers in double-A, and a finally healthy Baez going as far as arguing that he didn&rsquo;t get hit by a pitch just in order to unleash the fury of his swing a few more times, that future seems to be getting ever closer. The hardest thing to remember amidst the torrid progress of the youngsters is that the most important developments aren&rsquo;t even happening in the minors.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to forget against the backdrop of a 9 and 17 start to the season that Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro are in the midst of potential bounce-back seasons that are likely going to be more indicative of future success (<span style="text-decoration: line-through">or lack there of</span>) at the big league level than any feats reached by the top prospects on the farm. After all, the Cubs have already invested heavily in these two budding stars with big money, long term deals. Though they have been praised for being club-friendly contracts, both Rizzo (7 years and $41m at time of extension) and Castro (7 years, $60m at time of extension) had serious struggles in 2013 that threatened to curb the organization&rsquo;s pending turnaround.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo has always been a Jed Hoyer guy, following him from the Red Sox to the Padres in the Adrian Gonzalez deal and then from San Diego to Chicago in the Andrew Cashner swap. After a promising 87 game Cubs debut in 2012 (.285 and 15 homers), Rizzo underperformed in his first full campaign on the Northside, hitting just .233 on the year- a devastating .189 against southpaws.</p>
<p>Still, Rizzo is only now 24 years old and has the potential to be a middle-of-the-order run producer for a long time to come. The early returns from 2014 have been extremely promising, too. The first baseman is batting .283 with four home runs and has an .864 OPS. He is even succeeding at an exciting, if unsustainable, .387 clip against lefties as we head into May. Rizzo&rsquo;s BABIP has regressed to the mean (that&rsquo;s the good regress) after an unlucky 2013, but off-season adjustments are also contributing to his revival; an improved approach at the plate has lead to an impressive walk rate and team-leading wOBA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the other side of the infield, Starlin Castro is also back to his hitting ways after posting an anemic .245 average in 2013. The struggle was real last year, leaving even his strongest believers anxious as we clung to his historic 2012 season, and argued nervously that the track record for players with a 200-hit season under their belts before turning 22 is incredibly strong. He was the first to hit that mark at such a young age since Alex Rodriguez in 1996 and only the 10<sup>th</sup> player to ever do it, joining the likes of Joe DiMaggio, Ty Cobb, Lloyd Waner, and Al Kaline.</p>
<p>While Starlin&rsquo;s resurgence early in 2014 may not be altogether surprising, it is still a huge win for the organization. &nbsp;One sixth of the way through the year, Castro is raking at a .308 clip and is on pace to, once again, flirt with the 200-hit plateau. At 24, Castro is already a two-time All-Star and is the youngest player to ever lead the National League in hits. He is a piece to build around even as other middle infield prospects emerge behind him.</p>
<p>Lost in the juxtaposition of disappointment and excitement thanks to a floundering big league team and a farm system bursting at the seams with impact talent, Anthony Rizzo and Starlin Castro remain amongst the most important parts of the Cubs rebuild. While we wait for all the details to surface, this developing story is still in line for a happy ending.</p>
