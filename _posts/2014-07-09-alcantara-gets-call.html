<p><a href="/uploads/2014/04/Arismendy_Alcantara.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2014/04/Arismendy_Alcantara-300x168.jpg" alt="Arismendy_Alcantara" width="300" height="168" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-9822" /></a>Cubs prospect Arismendy Alcantara&nbsp;has been called up for the last two games of the Reds series. &nbsp;Alcantara will be covering for Darwin Barney while Barney is on paternity leave (there are already plenty of muscle flexes from people wanting Barney to take an extended leave). &nbsp;As far as Cubs prospects go, Alcantara flies under the radar a little as he is ranked seventh among Cubs prospects by MLB.com. &nbsp;However, the guy can definitely play ball. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He first grabbed my attention when I saw him <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130714&amp;content_id=53758292&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">hit a homer in the 2013 Futures Game</a>. &nbsp;With the Iowa Cubs this season, Alcantara is hitting .307 in 335 at-bats (most on the roster). &nbsp;Despite his somewhat small stature (5'10/170) and a slightly below-average power score on his scouting report, Alcantara has hit 10 home runs this season. &nbsp;He also leads the I-Cubs in doubles (25), triples (11), and stolen bases (21). &nbsp;Though Alcantara was originally a shortstop, he has played mostly 2nd base in the minors, and recently, he has been playing center field. &nbsp;The front office has made it known that this call-up will only be until Thursday, but it will be great to get a little preview of what Arismendy Alcantara can do.</p>
<p>Also, finally there is some dicussion about the pronunciation of his name:<br />

<p>English teachers should also consider using his name as an example of assonance.</p>
