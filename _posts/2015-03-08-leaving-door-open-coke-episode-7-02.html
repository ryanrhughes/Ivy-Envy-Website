  content: I hope this podcast is a long one.  I'm saving it for Wednesday - you guys
    are going to be keeping me company on a long marathon training run.  I'll need
    some distraction for sure!

  content: Dawn Strand I think it clocks in at 1:15.  You might not like our answer
    to your question.

  content: Welp - an hour and 15 minutes is worth 7 or 8 miles, and then I can stew
    about your answer to my question for another few miles.  That will certainly make
    a dent in my run.  Sounds like I'll be learning a lot about cricket as well??
    Hmmmm....

  content: Lol, Ivy Envy - you're right - I didn't much like your answer to my question,
    especially in my last weeks of training.  But I'd be wiling to take an injury
    for the team.  I really loved the return of the "Small Sample Size" song.  That
    sure made me laugh out loud during the run!
