  content: "Congrats on 100 episodes.  \r\n\r\nI'd also like to mention that I forgot
    to say good for the management for finally standing up to Carlos and letting him
    know everyone has collectively pretty much decided he has become more of a liability
    than an asset, even with a winning record.\r\n\r\nI saw a guy Friday night who
    was the same guy we had all sort of known.  A selfish, careless, intimidating
    dude who has likely used his size to make anyone who disagrees with him shake
    in their boots.  A bully in every sense of the word.  \r\n\r\nMeehan"

<p>This episode has everything you would expect from an Ivy Envy broadcast from the backyard - technical difficulties, awkward pauses and drunkenness.  We celebrate our 100th episode by having no real direction for the show and taking listener phone calls.  The show was streamed to our site by Ustream and Mixlr (for about 20 minutes).  </p>
<p>Obviously, most of the calls were about Zambrano, but there were plenty of other topics discussed.  I can't even begin to summarize what happens in the show.  You'll just have to listen and see for yourself.  </p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that spent their Saturday evening with us on Ustream and in the chat.  A big thanks to everyone that called in.  You  made the show interesting.  </p>
