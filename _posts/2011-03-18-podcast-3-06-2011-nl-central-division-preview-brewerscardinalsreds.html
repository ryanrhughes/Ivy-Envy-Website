<p>It&rsquo;s Part Two of our NL Central Division Preview.  Andy, Corey and Kurt invite fans and bloggers of other teams in the division on the show to help you size up the Cubs&rsquo; divisional opponents.</p>
<p>Steve Garczynski of <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/sports/fanblogs/berniescrew.html">Bernie's Crew</a> talks about the upgrades in pitching that the Brewers made in the off-season and how that will help them in competing for the division. &nbsp;Steve also updates us on Prince Fielder's free agency status.</p>
<p>Daniel Shoptaw from <a href="http://www.cardinal70.com/">C70 At The Bat</a> comes on to discuss the rival Cardinals with us. &nbsp;He also talks about the impending free-agency of their first baseman, LaRussa's future with the club and the injuries that are already striking the Cardinals.</p>
<p>Our good friend, Brian Welch from <a href="http://www.chris-sabos-goggles.com">Chris Sabo's Goggles</a> appears on the podcast once again to talk about Dusty and his group in Cincinnati. &nbsp;We spend a good portion of the time talking about Dusty's feces story and the reputation that the Reds are developing.</p>
