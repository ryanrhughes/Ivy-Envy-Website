<p>The Ivy Envy Podcast will be coming to you a few days early this week.&nbsp; The guys are scattering for the long weekend so Andy and I will do an episode tomorrow night.&nbsp; Since it will be just the two of us, I figure we can give the live blogging here on the site another try.</p>
<p>Also, we will be testing a live video podcast program.&nbsp; We have discussed doing a live show for our Saturday episodes and not only would you be able to hear the show live, you would be able to see us recording.&nbsp; This might make for some interesting shows and we could incorporate phone calls and make things a little more interactive.</p>
<p>So that's the agenda for tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for tonight, I will be posting on Twitter throughout the game.</p>
