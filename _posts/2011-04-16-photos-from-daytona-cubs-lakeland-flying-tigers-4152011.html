<p>A reader of the site and listener of the podcast, Justan, was able to take in Friday's Daytona Cubs game against the Lakeland Flying Tigers in Lakeland, Florida.  Daytona sent Brett Wallach to the mound tonight.  Wallach came to the Cubs in from the Dodgers in the Ted Lilly/Ryan Theriot trade, and is the son of former All-Star and current 3rd base coach for the Dodgers, Tim Wallach.  </p>
<p>Wallach is 22 years old and had quite the turnaround (in the wrong direction) after being traded to the Cubs.  Wallach spent all of 2010 in the Midwest League, with Great Lakes (Dodgers) and then with the Peoria Chiefs.  With Great Lakes, he went 6-0 with a 3.72 ERA.  After moving over to Peoria, he went 0-4 with a 5.76 ERA.  Wallach had another rough outing Friday evening.  He earned the loss and gave up 4 runs on 3 hits in 4 1/3 innings pitched.  He walked 7, striking out 2 and gave up one homerun.  He is 0-1 with a 7.27 ERA after two appearances with Daytona in 2011.</p>
<p>Daytona lost the game 6-3, but there were some offensive highlights.  Jae-Hoon Ha got some playing time in Spring Training (I saw him come in to pinch run at a game and promptly get picked off) and he's off to a hot start.  Ha is hitting .400 on the season and went 3-5 with a double and a triple on Friday.  The only player on the Daytona roster with a higher batting average is Nelson Perez (.474), but Daytona is currently using him only against right-handed pitching.  Perez's numbers are benefitting from the early season small sample size.  He had a .262 average between Peoria and Daytona, last year.  In his 27 games with Daytona in 2010, Perez hit .163.   Junior Lake and Ivy Envy favorite, Michael Burgess, had doubles and center-field speedster Evan Crawford hit a triple in Friday night's game.</p>
<p>There are other names on the 2011 Daytona roster that average fans will recognize.  Welington Castillo came up and spent some time with the Cubs when the rosters expanded at the end of the 2010 season.  It was Castillo's broken bat that pierced Tyler Colvin's chest.  Castillo also got some playing time in Spring Training this year.  He is splitting time behind the plate in Daytona with Michael Brenly, owner of magnificent thighs and son of Cubs television color-man, Bob Brenly.  Nick Struck pitched a no-hitter in Peoria last year and has started the season with Daytona, as has Zach Rosscup, who came to the Cubs in the Matt Garza deal.</p>
<p>Here are some photos that Justan took from Friday's game.  Thanks for sharing them, Justan.<br />
