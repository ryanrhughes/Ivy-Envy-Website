<p>It didn't take long for the new front office and coaching staff to identify the most glaring weaknesses with the Chicago Cubs - fundamentals and effort.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When you lose that many games, there are obviously problems. Losing isn&rsquo;t OK. Not running a ball out isn&rsquo;t OK. It&rsquo;s unacceptable, and that has to be communicated.&rsquo;&rsquo; - Dale Sveum</blockquote></p>
<p>Everything we have heard this Spring is that the players that don't play fundamentally sound, or with effort, should expect to face the consequences.  When Cubs fans hear those two terms, "fundaments" and "effort", our minds go to the biggest violator on the team - Alfonso Soriano.  </p>
<p>A lot of Cubs fans are ready for the organization to take off their kids gloves with Soriano and hold him accountable for his lack of effort.  At this year's Cubs Convention, Soriano was the only player that was booed by fans when introduced.  The source of that angst might be his salary and how it's compared to his production.  I think it's more likely that it's from the fact that everyone in that room has seen Soriano at the plate, posturing and gazing at home runs and would-be home runs.  </p>
<p>Then came Soriano's quote at Cubs Convention about hoping that with the new management, he would be given the green-light to run more.  While it's laughable that Soriano is implying that the Cubs had held him back, it was a sign that Soriano is perhaps ready to change and embrace the new culture of the Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>Well, if you're ready for Sveum to have a zero-tolerance or tough approach on Soriano, don't hold your breath.  Sveum addressed the HR/almost HR ball-watching in Mesa.  He drew a parallel to coaching Bill Hall with the Brewers.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that (Hall) didn&rsquo;t play hard.  They feel bad (afterward). That&rsquo;s a natural major-league habit. It&rsquo;s very hard to hit fly balls that are almost home runs, or you think might be a home run, and sprint to first base."  - Dale Sveum<br />
</blockquote></p>
<p>So is this a sign that Sveum isn't the hard-ass he implied he will be all off-season when players were a few months and thousands of miles from the field? Maybe.  Will Sveum hold players to different standards based on their paychecks and hears of experience?  Maybe.  </p>
<p>Here's what I'm hoping is more likely the case.  Perhaps the Cubs don't want attention drawn to this issue.  During the Jim Hendry years, the Cubs were legendary for driving down the trade value of a player they were trying to unload.  Perhaps the Cubs will work with Soriano on the effort-areas and try to minimize the attention drawn to it.  </p>
<p>The Cubs are not going to make it easier to ship off Soriano if they draw negative attention to him and his effort on the field.  One thing is certain - Cubs fans will be watching Soriano..and most will be rooting for the great start of the 2012 season, in hopes that it lures a team into trading for him.  I know I'll be watching for this magical green-light that Soriano expects.  </p>
