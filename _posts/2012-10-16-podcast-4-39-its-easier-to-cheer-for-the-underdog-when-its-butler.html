<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt briefly comment on how the MLB playoffs are going after a listener asks us about the idea of teams with much worse records potentially playing in the World Series.  Andy lets us know what is going on with the players from the Cubs organization that are playing in the Arizona Fall League.  Corey pulls out our 2012 pre-season over/under predictions to see how we fared.  We pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest and Kurt gives us another gem of a Cubs.com comment.  </p>
