<p>Spring Training is officially underway and yesterday, Theo Epstein <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/story/2012-02-18/mlb-chicago-cubs-theo-epstein/53146928/1" target="_blank">informed us</a> all of the "Cubs Way".  This is an "few hundred page" organizational manual that is being written with the goal of getting all levels of the organization, from the Dominican Summer League all the way up to the major league club, on the same page with the same strategies and methods.  </p>
<blockquote><p> "Playing hard is a big part of it but playing the game the right way and teaching it consistently are as well." - Theo Epstein</blockquote></p>
<blockquote><p>"We're going to be teaching the game the exact same way," Esptein said, "everything from what foot you hit the bag with when you're making the turn to how we run bunt plays to what our overall hitting philosophy is." - Theo Epstein</blockquote></p>
<p>In the press conference in Mesa on Satuday, Epstein and Sveum continued to stress the importance of solid play in the fundamental aspects of the game.  As Cubs fans, we're used to hearing managers and the front office give lip service to fundamentals before, but it appears that these areas of the game will now be the focus.  I'm sure it didn't take Theo long in looking at tape or talking with people to realize how much this club is lacking in the basic aspects of the game.  If, in his time with the Red Sox, he watched SportsCenter once a week, I'm sure he picked up on it.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't expect to see a team with flawless fundamentals in the near-future.  The young players will need to learn the "right way" to play the game and the veterans will need to remember and re-learn.  I haven't played baseball since 1988, so I can't speak from experience, but I would assume we'll see quite a bit of hesitancy from players that are having to think about the fundamentals rather than playing loose...and wrong.  When these things become instinct, we'll start seeing the fruits of "Cubs Way".  </p>
<p>While Theo says the goal of the 2012 team is the win the World Series, there's no doubt that the organization is laying the foundation for a solid and consistent team a few years down the road.  </p>
