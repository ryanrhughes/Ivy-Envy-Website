<p>I'm going to keep with a theme of posts about numbers and the NL Central. It was the topic of my <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=849" target="_blank">last post</a>, but I'm going to take a different approach this time. Last time I talked about the competition in the NL Central and the strength of that division and harped on the statistical disadvantages the Cubs face. This time, let's assume there is no competition. Obviously, you have to win games and to do that you need opponents, but let's forget the race and speak in terms of everyones favorite "one game at a time" cliche.</p>
<p>I have a Cubs schedule on my bulletin board in my office (see above). It lets me see the season's progress and gives a quick overview of how things are going and sheds light on trends like eight game losing streaks. The regular season has one goal; make the playoffs. There seems to be little disadvantage in baseball to getting there via the wildcard so I'm not going to discount it as an unsuccessful result. In the "wildcard era" the NL wildcard team has made it to the World Series six out of fourteen years. The Marlins have won it twice.</p>
<p>So, what will it take to make the playoffs? This year's central is the best I have seen to this date. I'm going to predict it will take at least 95 wins to take it, two short of last years 97. If someone else in the division wins more than 95 then I'm quite confident that 95 w's will take the wildcard. It's only required more one time when the Mets needed 97 in 1999. If the mark is set at 95 what do the Cubs need to do to get there? Here we go with the one game at a time scenario. Just win 69 more games (after June 5) ... one at a time. They have 111 games to get it done. 69-42 is a .620 winning percentage and that's not easy. Possible, but not easy. The bottom line is the Cubs need to play as well as they are supposed to when you look at this team on paper. Too many more 8 game losing streaks and it's not going to happen.</p>
<p>Baseball cliches annoy me, but the one game at a time, one series at a time game plan seems to make sense for this Cub team.</p>
