  content: "Reed Johnson = my favorite Cub.\r\n\r\nI suppose I am a bit bias because
    he wears my favorite number, but I like the idea of a guy being essentially tossed
    to the curb rebounding to become a very good player.\r\n\r\nJohnson is gritty.
    He's not flashy. And he has a great soul patch bleeding into gotee.\r\n\r\nI'll
    miss DeRosa, and I will be disappointed if this is it -- no more acquisitions
    -- but I think the Cubs will be OK.\r\n\r\nThe Paul Bako signing, on the other
    hand... I'm sorry... I REFUSE to buy this \"he's another left-handed bat\" B.S.
    He's a backup catcher. You want a backup catcher to be a backup CATCHER. He's
    not suppose to provide offense. He's supposed to relieve the starter, and call
    a good game."

<p>I know for a fact that I'm not the only Cubs fan that was confused by the trade of Mark Derosa.&nbsp; Now this won't become a historical bad trade.&nbsp; This isn't Ernie Broglio for Lou Brock.&nbsp; Heck, this isn't even Ryne Sandberg and Larry Bowa for Ivan DeJesus.&nbsp; What it is, however, is a team leader that hit .285 with 21 HR and 87 RBI's while playing every position in the field other than pitcher and catcher last year.&nbsp; He's a good guy.&nbsp; A guy that I can't recall anyone every saying anything bad about.&nbsp; That's a pretty rare feat given the amount of criticism, expectation and analysis in sports these days.&nbsp; I'm not saying he was never criticized, I just don't remember hearing it.</p>
<p>There's no disputing that the Cubs will miss Derosa.&nbsp; Even if they won't admit it, us fans will.&nbsp; But to echo something that <a href="www.qconline.com/bloggers/vetopower">Matt Veto</a> said in the Ivy Envy Podcast's <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=282">Episode #1</a>, we have to try to get away from comparing players no longer wearing cubbie blue to the new additions.&nbsp; Of course, we won't be able to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will ignore all that on-the-field stuff.&nbsp; What I will allow myself to miss is <a href="http://markderosa.mlblogs.com/">The Pulse</a>, Derosa's blog.&nbsp; Though it wasn't updated enough for my satisfaction, this was a great read.&nbsp; I think that MLB is onto something with sponsoring blogs of certain players.&nbsp; During the season, all we get from players is short sound-bites and sports cliches.&nbsp; What Derosa offered was intelligent and interesting material delivered with honesty and an Ivy League education.&nbsp; I don't know if Derosa will blog for the Indians.&nbsp; His site is empty, though there is an Indians logo on the top of the page.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090309&amp;content_id=3952150&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc">Carrie Muskat</a>,Reed Johnson will take over the blogging duties for the Cubs.&nbsp; I like the idea of the "average guys" doing these blogs, though I suspect that a Zambrano blog would be wildly entertaining.&nbsp; Now Johnson is not Ivy League educated, but he did go to Cal State Fullerton, which is wear my sister-in-law and brother-in-law both earned their degrees.&nbsp; My wife is also a graduate of the CSU system (Cal State Long Beach).&nbsp; I think Reed will make for an adequate replacement as a blogger.&nbsp; His work ethic on the field can't be questioned, so I'm hoping for frequent updates.</p>
