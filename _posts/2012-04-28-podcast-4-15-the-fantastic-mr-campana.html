  content: Bryan LaHair has indeed been a bright spot in an otherwise dark alley.&nbsp;

<p>Andy, Brian and Corey are joined by Kurt via Skype for this episode.  The Cubs are 4-2 in the last week and have beat some decent competition in the Reds, Cardinals and Phillies.</p>
<p>The Cubs wouldn't have won a few of these games without Tony Campana, and we talk about his impact on this team.  We look back on Marlon Byrd's time with the Cubs and consider what he will be remembered for.  </p>
<p>Paul Maholm gets on track with his last two starts and returns to the form we had hoped to see from him this year.  Bryan LaHair is also another bright spot on this Cubs team so far and we discuss his production.</p>
<p>We then look at the teams in the Cubs minor league system and discuss how those teams and individuals are doing, so far in the 2012 season.  </p>
