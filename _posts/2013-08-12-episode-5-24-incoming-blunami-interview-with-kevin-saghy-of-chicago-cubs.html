<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt cover a variety of topics on this episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast.  Kurt went to an Iowa Cubs this last weekend to see Jake Arrieta pitch.  Kurt saw some...interesting stuff from Arrieta.  </p>
<p>Then, I play an interview with Kevin Saghy.  Kevin is the Manager of Communications for the Cubs and talks about how the Cubs use social media to connect with fans.  He also tells us about the Cubs 2013 Social Media Night, which is next Wednesday, August 21st.  <center><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SocialMedia.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SocialMedia-300x235.jpg" alt="SocialMedia" width="300" height="235" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8564" /></a></center></p>
<p>To buy tickets for Cubs Social Media Night, <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/chc/ticketing/specialevents.jsp" target="_blank">click here</a>. </p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions, many of which revolve around the Cubs series win vs. the Cardinals.  Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week and then we pick a winner for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
