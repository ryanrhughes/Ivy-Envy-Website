  content: Campana's defense is a little sketchy though.  I can't see him ever throwing
    out someone at home.  His throws have no distance and are way off-line.

  content: His arm is sketchy, not his defense. He has the best range I have ever
    seen and has a good glove. His arm is his only weakness in the field

  content: Yeah. His range is good, but if a guy on third is going to score on a pop-op,
    even if Campana is only 10 feet behind second, I'd define it as a defensive hindrance.

<p>We've joked about Tony Campana's big floppy glove several times on the podcast, but I also think&nbsp;what he has meant to this&nbsp;team needs to be mentioned.&nbsp; Campana is the fastest player the Cubs have had in a long time.&nbsp; He is perhaps one of the fastest players in the majors right now.&nbsp; Though Aramis Ramirez got the walk-off single in Wednesday night's ballgame against the Giants, it was Campana's speed on the basepaths that put Ramirez in a position to get that hit.&nbsp; Just having him on base is such a distraction to an opposing pitcher.&nbsp; He has stolen eight bases in nine attempts, and he has only appeared in 35 games.&nbsp; This is a revelation for a team whose best base stealer has been Ryan Theriot in the past couple seasons.</p>
<p>Campana's only problem has been getting on base enough.&nbsp; He is currently hitting .268 with&nbsp;a slightly alarming .307 OBP (Soriano's is slightly higher!).&nbsp; If he can improve in his hitting and continue to perfect his bunting, he could be an invaluable weapon for the Cubs going forward.</p>
<p>The main thing I wanted to mention is Bob Brenly's quotation about Campana today.&nbsp; John Cusack was in the booth and asked Brenly if he could ride along in the plane's cargo hold for the Cubs' upcoming trip to Washington.&nbsp; Brenly responded, "Maybe you could ride in Tony Campana's glove."</p>
