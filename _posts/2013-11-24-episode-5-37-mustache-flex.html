<p>Andy, Corey and Kurt throw a doozy at you with this episode.  Lots of mustache talk, more Internet Muscle Flexes than you've heard before and Chuck Mangione background music.  We look at how the Cubs prospects did in the Arizona Fall League, specifically Kris Bryant, Jorge Soler, Albert Almora and Dallas Beeler.  We also look at three members of the 2014 coaching staff.  </p>
<p>We answer a handful of listener questions that include Jeff Samardzija's future with the Cubs, best Cubs memories, a discussion on if the Cubs would trade away Javier Baez and the Cubs timetable and what expectations are for 2015.  </p>
