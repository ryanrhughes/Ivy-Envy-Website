<p>In his Scary Stat of the Week segment on <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-5-05-on-really-good-offense-days-theyll-score-a-few-runs/" target="_blank">Episode 5.05 of The Ivy Envy Podcast</a>, Kurt gave us stats to show how good the starting pitching is and how poor the bullpen is for the Chicago Cubs.  </p>
<p>The first two games of the Reds series has only padded those stats.  Last night, on our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/facebook" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>, Kurt gave us an update on these stats.</p>
<p><strong><u>Innings 1-6</strong></u><br />
ERA - 2.76 (2nd in MLB)<br />
Batting Average Against - .203 (1st in MLB)<br />
WHIP - 1.14 (3rd in MLB)<br />
Hits Allowed - 84 (1st in MLB)</p>
<p><strong><u>Innings 7 and later</strong></u><br />
ERA - 5.14 (Worst in MLB)<br />
Batting Average Against - .264 (27th in MLB)<br />
WHIP - 1.36 (24th in MLB)<br />
Hits Allowed - 56 (23rd in MLB)</p>
<p>The starting pitching is keeping the Cubs in games and they continue to lose because of their inability to hit with runners in scoring position and the bullpen.  The Cubs will probably continue to pick up bullpen help from the scrap heap, keep throwing it against the wall and hope something sticks.  </p>
<p>That strategy is what brought Kevin Gregg over, and he's appeared in 3 games and has not given up a run.  However, with his 2.50 WHIP, he's doing everything BUT letting players touch home-plate.  So if I had to guess, expect to see more Kevin Gregg's in 2013.  </p>
