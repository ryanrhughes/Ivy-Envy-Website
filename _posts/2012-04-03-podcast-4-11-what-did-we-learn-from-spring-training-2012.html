  content: Randy Wells will benefit from spending a month or so in the minors.&nbsp;
    Sometimes sending a guy down to the minors really makes him more level headed
    and lets him know that this could all be over before you know it.&nbsp; And of
    course sometimes they just become alcoholics and you never hear from them again.&nbsp;

<p>Andy and Corey wrap up Spring Training and discuss what we learned from Spring Training 2012.  Stolen bases encourage, while errors continue to concern.  Randy Wells heads to Iowa and we talk about that move.  We welcome Joe Martin on the podcast to tell us about what he saw during the full day he spent at Fitch.  Joe gives us his overall impressions of Spring Training this year and makes a bold prediction on the 2012 Cubs. </p>
<p>We also talk about the WGN/Tribune Company vs DirecTV battle and the rule change that the Cubs and MLB made in regards to the distance a person that wins tickets to a Cubs game is from Wrigley Field.  </p>
