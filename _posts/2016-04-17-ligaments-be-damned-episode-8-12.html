<p>We start things off by talking about the new Wrigley Field clubhouse.  We talk about some of the individual performances in the two series this week.  Javier Baez was called up and is already demonstrating his presence at the plate and his versatility in the field.  </p>
<p>We share some scary stats and read some internet muscle flexes.  </p>
