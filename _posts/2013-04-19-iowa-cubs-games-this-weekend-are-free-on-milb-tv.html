<p><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/milbtv_01.jpg"><img src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/milbtv_01-300x238.jpg" alt="Iowa Cubs MiLB.tv" width="300" height="238" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-8423" /></a>This weekend, MiLB.tv is running a free trial weekend.  Cubs fans will be able to watch three Iowa Cubs games:<br />
*  <strong>Friday</strong> - Nashville (Brewers) @ Iowa 7:05pm Central<br />
*  <strong>Saturday</strong> - Iowa @ Memphis (Cardinals) - 6:05pm Central<br />
*  <strong>Sunday</strong> - Iowa @ Memphis (Cardinals) - 1:30pm Central</p>
<p>Barret Loux (1-1, 10.50) will be taking the mound tonight against Nashville.  Chris Rusin (1-1, 3.50) will pitch Saturday.  Drew Carpenter (1-2, 8.10) will take the mound on Sunday.  Iowa is currently sitting at the bottom of the division with a 4-9 record.  Iowa is coming off a few rainouts, so you will have the opportunity to watch a fully rested Ian Stewart.  </p>
<p>A few years ago, I subscribed to MiLB.tv and really enjoyed it.  I was able to find a coupon code for it that year.  I haven't been able to find one the last few years.  The season package costs $40 and I believe every Iowa game is included and at times, Tennesse, Daytona and Kane County games will be broadcast.  </p>
<p>To watch these games this weekend, go to <a href="http://milb.tv" target="_blank">MiLB.tv</a>. </p>
