  content: I tell my students to say "Sometimes I try to do too much and bite off
    more than I can chew."   Considering where they are usually interviewing and the
    people that are usually interviewing, it works well.

<p>I hope none of you missed <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110723&amp;content_id=22179202&amp;notebook_id=22180640&amp;vkey=notebook_chc&amp;c_id=chc" target="_blank">this article by Carrie Muskat</a> that was posted a couple days ago on Cubs.com.&nbsp; The article consists of Alfonso Soriano trying to explain his recent struggles at the plate.&nbsp; If you haven't been keeping track, Soriano has hit sub-.200 in the month of July.&nbsp; He had also gone without a homer for about a month until he ended his drought against the Astros.</p>
<p>Soriano's explanation for his gelid bat: "The way we lose, the way we play, sometimes I think about the team instead of thinking about me first . . . sometimes you try to control the whole situation and mentally I get tired."</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; That sounds like bad-job-interview-speak to me.&nbsp; At some point you were probably told that during an interview, you may get asked about your weaknesses, and you should try to turn your weakness into a strength.&nbsp; Soriano is basically saying, "Sometimes I just care too much," or "I'm such a team player that sometimes my personal well-being suffers."&nbsp; I don't buy it.&nbsp; Dolores, will you show this man to the door?</p>
