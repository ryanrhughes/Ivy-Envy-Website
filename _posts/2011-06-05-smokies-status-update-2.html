<p>It feels like God hates the Cubs' pitching staff, and it's not just the at the major-league level.&nbsp; This wrath is now extending down through the system as well.&nbsp; Rob Whitenack, who has been one of the best pitchers in the system this year, is going to have to have Tommy John surgery.&nbsp; Splitting his time between Daytona and Tennessee this season, Whitenack has posted a 7-0 record and an ERA of 1.93.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Whitenack hasn't been necessarily considered one of the Cubs' top prospects (8th round pick in '09), he had upgraded his reputation based on his performance this season.</p>
<p>Speaking of top prospects, Trey McNutt has now been placed on the disabled list.&nbsp; He has dealt with blister problems for most of the season, but this recent DL stint is apparently due to a collision with another player.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ouchyfinger.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5348" title="ouchyfinger" src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ouchyfinger.jpg" alt="" width="155" height="200" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The McNutt injury now gives the Peoria Chiefs' RHP Dallas Beeler a shot at the double A level.&nbsp; With all of the injuries and the performance issues with the big-league staff, I expect the Cubs to go after plenty of pitching in the upcoming draft.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In case you haven't been paying attention for a while (and I don't blame you if you haven't), the Smokies' DJ LeMahieu was called up to the Cubs the other day.&nbsp; He hasn't made too much of an impact--he has one start at third for Ramirez, and he has one hit so far.</p></p>
