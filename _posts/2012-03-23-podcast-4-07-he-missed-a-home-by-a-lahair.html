<p>We are reaching the dog days of Spring Training, but there are some bright spots and not-so-bright spots to be paying attention to here in the last few weeks of Spring Training. </p>
<p>Jeff Samardzija seems to have solidified his spot in the starting rotation and we discuss who will get the other spot, who will end up pitching long-relief and who will be heading to Des Moines.  The Cubs will soon announce the Opening Day starter and we give our opinions on who that person should be.</p>
<p>One of the few spots that are open to competition this Spring is the back-up catcher spot and we take a look at how Welington Castillo and Steve Clevenger are doing.  </p>
<p>We also look at the players that are struggling this spring - Travis Wood, Bryan LaHair and David DeJesus.  LaHair is the most interesting because of Anthony Rizzo breathing down his neck for that 1st base spot.  </p>
<p>Then we get Joe Martin on the phone from Arizona and he tells us about a few games that he went to in the last week.  Finally, we go through the captions for this week's photo.  We had a lot of entries, so thanks to everyone for giving us your captions.  You can join in these weekly photo caption contests over at our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/IvyEnvyPodcast" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.  </p>
