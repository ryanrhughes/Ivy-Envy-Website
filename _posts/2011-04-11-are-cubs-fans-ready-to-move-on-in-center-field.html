<p>Cubs fans are a fickle bunch.  We are about a week and a half into the 2011 season and I've already read/heard multiple Cubs fans calling for the club to ditch Marlon Byrd in favor of Brett Jackson, who is currently in Double-A Tennessee.  I don't know what it is about Cubs fans that causes them/us to think that whatever we have in the minors must be better than what the big league team currently has.  You will recall the demands for the Cubs to bench or trade Derrek Lee in 2009 so that they could replace him with Micah Hoffpauir.  In case you forgot, Hoffpauir's .342 2008 was revealed to be a fluke.  His numbers decreased and his age increased.  He's now playing baseball in Japan.  </p>
<p>These calls for "Jackson over Byrd" make no sense to me.  Let's first look at Marlon Byrd.  Marlon Byrd was one of the few bright spots on the 2010 Cubs.  Cubs fans fell in love with his hustle in the field and the dedication and hard work he shows on a daily basis.  Not once have I seem Marlon Byrd loaf on a play.  When I was at Spring Training, I noticed that Byrd was out stretching and exercising a good 15 minutes before other Cubs players came out.  Showing appreciation to the fans also appeared to be very important to Byrd.  There is nobody on the team that spent more time talking to fans and signing autographs.  </p>
<p>"Oh, you're just defending Byrd because he hams it up with the fans" you say?  Let's look at his stats.  Marlon Byrd got off to a slow start against the Pirates, but he has turned it around quickly.  At the end of the Brewers series on Sunday, 9 games into the season, Byrd was hitting .342 with 5 doubles.  He's hitting both left-handed and right-handed pitching well.  The only area that his game is lacking right now is he's not doing well at the plate with runners in scoring position.  He's batting .182 in these situations.  I haven't been able to watch every game this season, but he might be lacking in another area - an area that Cubs fans really appreciated last year.  I'm not sure if he's had the opportunity to have any great diving plays.  It seemed that it was in these situations, especially when comparing him to his neighbor in the outfield, Alfonso Soriano, that Cubs fans really fell in love with Marlon.  </p>

<p>Ideally, Brett Jackson will be the future in CF for the Cubs.  He's gotten off to a great start for the Tennessee Smokies.  At the end of Sunday's game, Jackson is batting .412 with a HR and 4 RBIs.  Brett had a great game on Sunday, leading the Smokies to an 8-4 win over the Chattanooga Lookouts, going 2-4 with a grand slam.  I like Brett Jackson a lot.  I got to see him play a little bit at Spring Training and talked with him for a few minutes at Fitch Park after the Minor League scrimmages.  </p>
<p>I think it's ridiculous to call for the Cubs to ditch a guy that is playing well, and has this year and next left on his reasonably priced contract.  It makes no sense to take away development time from Jackson, who is only 22 years old.  I'm sure he'd love to be in Chicago right now, but why rush it?  Jackson was a #1 draft pick for the Cubs, he is ranked as the #2 prospect in the Cubs system and #38 prospect in all of baseball, according to Baseball America.  As a Cubs fan, I want to see him develop and mature into a solid center-fielder for the Cubs and I think you'd have to be an idiot to think that pulling him up now to replace a guy that is hitting .342 would be good for Brett Jackson or the Cubs, in the short or long term.  </p>
