Friday: (W) Cubs 6 Cardinals 3<br />
Saturday: (L) Cardinals 10 Cubs 4<br />
Sunday: (L) Cardinals 6 Cubs 4</p>
<p>Cubs lose series 2-1<br />
Cubs record: 4-8</p>
<p><u><strong>The Good</u></strong><br />
<strong>Jeff Samardzija</strong> had yet another superb outing that resulted in a no-decision.  Friday night, Samardzija went 7 innings and gave up 1 run on 6 hits with 4 strikeouts and no walks.  In his first three outings of the 2014 season, Samardzija has a 1.29 ERA, a 1.05 WHIP and has struck out 15 while walking 5.  He unfortunately doesn't have a win yet, but we'll get to that later.   </p>
<p>Friday's game had the makings of a typical heart-breaking extra innings loss to the Cardinals, but <strong>Welington Castillo</strong> hit a 3-run HR in the top of the 11th inning and the Cubs won the opening game of the series.  Hitting a game-winning home run against the Cardinals will always get you in "The Good" category, but Castillo has really struggled in the first few weeks of the season, especially with the strikeouts.  In 36 at-bats, Castillo has 14 strikeouts and only 2 walks and a .222 batting average.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Bad</u></strong><br />
The Cubs closer situation is not a pretty one right now.  <strong>Jose Veras</strong> has had two save opportunities and has blown both opportunities, including Friday's game which took away Samardzija's opportunity to register a win.  Finding the strike zone is the problem for Veras right now.  In his four appearances, Veras has only given up 2 hits, but he's walked 7 and hit 3 batters.  It's not a good sign when you have only give up 2 hits and you have a 12.27 ERA.  </p>
<p><u><strong>The Ugly</u></strong><br />
I really like <strong>Carlos Villanueva</strong>, but WOW was he bad on Saturday.  The poor defensive decisions the Cubs made didn't help him any, but the Cardinals were knocking him all over the ballpark.  Villanueva left the game after 3 innings pitched.  He surrendered 9 runs on 10 hits.  </p>
<p><strong>The Cubs offense</strong> is not making things easy for Jeff Samardzija.  When Samardzija is in the game, the Cubs have given him .5 runs per game in support.  </p>
<p>Going back to the beginning of September of the 2013 season, <strong>the Cubs have now lost 9 series in a row</strong>.  The Cubs schedule is pretty rough in April and May and this streak could extend for quite a while.  </p>
