<p><center><a href="/uploads/2013/02/CHICAGO_CUBS_IAN_STEWART_FEB22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8225" alt="Ian Stewart" src="/uploads/2013/02/CHICAGO_CUBS_IAN_STEWART_FEB22-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" data-id="8225" /></a></center>This morning, <a href="https://twitter.com/CarrieMuskat" target="_blank">Carrie Muskat tweeted</a> that two Cubs 3rd basemen, Ian Stewart and Josh Vitters had MRI tests that showed mild to moderate quad strains and could be out 10-14 days. This is bad news for Ian Stewart. Stewart signed a 1-year, $2 million contract in the off-season. This is a non-guaranteed contract, so the Cubs could cut Stewart loose.</p>
<p>Injuries have plagued the Stewart, who was drafted in the 1st round, 10th pick overall in 2003. Last year, his first with the Cubs, Stewart was limited to 55 games with a wrist injury. He played just 48 games with the Colorado Rockies in 2011.</p>
<p>This quad strain occurred in Thursday's Cubs scrimmage at Hohokam Stadium as Stewart rounded 1st base in his first action since June 9th. "I hadn't run the bases in a long time", <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130222&amp;content_id=41880936&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;c_id=mlb" target="_blank">said Stewart</a>. I would hope that exercises and drills that do not involve what he's been rehabbing for the last 6 months would have been emphasized during Stewart's time at Spring Training.</p>
<p>This leaves Luis Valbuena as the primary option at 3rd base. The Cubs hopes that Stewart is able to become the player he's been projected for years, but with each injury, that looks less and less likely. With a lack of run-producing power on this team, especially considering Soriano will be out the door the first opportunity the Cubs have. In his last healthy season (2009), Stewart hit 25 HR and 70 RBIs.</p>
<p>While Valbuena can fill-in adequately in the field, he can't match the offensive production that Stewart could (in theory) provide. In 90 games and 303 plate appearances last season, Valbuena hit .219 with 4 HR and 28 RBIs.</p>
<p>What it all boils down to is that the Cubs are in a patch-work stage of the development of the organization. That's why the Cubs are in this position. Neither player is the long-term solution at third base and are in Chicago to keep third base warm until the Cubs figure out what to do with the infield talent that is still a year or two away.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, speaking of not being the long-term solution at third-base, Josh Vitters also hurt his quad.</p>
