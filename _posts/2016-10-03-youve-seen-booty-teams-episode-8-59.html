<p>We will have plenty of time to fret about the playoffs, but we felt like we should take a deep breath and appreciate the 2016 season for what it was.  In this episode, we talk about some of the key moments and plays. We look at the team performance in offense, defense, and pitching.  We also talk about some of the individual player performances on the season.  </p>
