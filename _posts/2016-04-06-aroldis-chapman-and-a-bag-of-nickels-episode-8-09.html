<p><img data-id="10146"  src="http://ivyenvy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" />Welcome to our first mid-week episode of the 2016 Cubs season.  This also happens to be our 387<sup>th</sup> episode.  </p>
<p>On this episode, we swoon over the 2016 Cubs and their absolute destruction of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.  After a slow Spring Training, the offense picks up where it left off in 2015, outscoring the Angels 15-1 in the two game series.  </p>
<p>While the sample sizes are way too small to get too crazy about individual performances, Cubs fans have reason to be happy as the team heads back to Arizona to face the Diamondbacks. </p>
