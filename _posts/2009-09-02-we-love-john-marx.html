  content: 'It would be pretty ironic if he died this year and the Cubs won the World
    Series next year. You know.. I''ve never liked John Marx.  In fact, there are
    literally no local writers that I like.  Barb Ickes is annoying, whoever that
    old guy is that''s written for years is a dirty old man.. I suppose that''s why
    they''re all writing for a Quad City newspaper instead of winning Pulitzers in
    L.A. or something.  My personal favorite:  when John Marx writes his colomns where
    he clearly had nothing to write about but had a legally binding contract that
    says he has to produce something so he writes that garbage that is on his mind..
    i.e. something to the tune of "Has anyone else noticed that the sky is blue?"  or
    "Is it just me or is there a direct correlation between the price of gas and how
    often I deficate?"  What a schmuck.'

<p>and he loves the Cubs.&nbsp; In one of Marx's recent articles for <em><a href="http://www.qconline.com/index.php" target="_blank">The Dispatch </a></em>he writes, "In the past 30 days, the Cubs have slipped in the standings, and are now in danger of having the season's towel tossed in.&nbsp; Now wouldn't that make for a perfect ending to a near-perfect summer?"&nbsp; So, what you're telling me, sir, is that you like reveling in other team's misfortunes more than celebrating your own favorite team's successes?&nbsp; And what team does Mr. Marx like that is helping him to have this "near-perfect summer?"&nbsp; <strong>He never mentions that team's name in his article</strong>.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Instead, the focus is on how much of a "Cub loather" he is.&nbsp; He goes on to inform readers of his future "whereabouts when the Cubs win the World Series" which will be "the cemetery plot&nbsp;[he has]&nbsp;purchased."&nbsp; God, please help the Cubs pull off a miracle and win the series this year.&nbsp; I don't want to "wait 'til next year" anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We've already&nbsp;made known <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/?p=1039" target="_blank">our feelings toward fans who expend more energy hating a team</a> than they do cheering on their own, so I want to talk about something else.&nbsp; Studies show that <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-origin-of-hatred" target="_blank">the areas of the brain activated by hate are the same areas activated by love</a>.&nbsp; There is a fine line between love and hate, so I choose to celebrate my indifference toward the Cardinals.&nbsp; So, even though right now Marx is spewing acrimonious words at the Cubs and Cubs fans, I wouldn't be surprised if his relationship with the Cubs ends up like the formula to so many romantic comedies--it begins with complete disdain and ends with the pair clinking wine glasses together in a tropical locale.</p>
