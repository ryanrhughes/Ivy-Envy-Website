Apparently, for the Cardinals and their fans, this series started with an injury in the Cubs/Pirates series.  </p>
<p>There was no lack of drama in this series.  We sort it all out, share our opinions and talk about the playoffs and how this Cubs team is shaping up for post-season play.  </p>
<p>In this episode, Kurt talks about Tim Sheridan's project and the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/public-address#/story">Indie Gogo campaign</a> where you can support <u>Public Address</u>.  </p>
