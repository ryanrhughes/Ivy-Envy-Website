  content: "Man, I'm depressed now, Kurt.  \r\n\r\nEven though I talked about watching
    the Cubs just to enjoy some baseball, my brain still has some tendrils clinging
    to the hope that they still could pull off a miracle and make it.  The Rockies
    just had a three-game losing streak going, and that also gives me hope that they
    could perhaps play sub-.500 ball for the rest of the year.  But they are 6-4 in
    their last ten games.  I know Corey doesn't want them to pull it off because then
    they will have made it to the playoffs in an imperfect season."

  content: "I hope I, and Debbie, are wrong. I'll take the playoffs. \r\nThey actually
    lost 4 in a row between the Padres and Giants, but before that they had won 8
    in a row. My scenario also neglects to acknowledge that there are three other
    teams between the Rockies and Cubs that also need to play poorly and hand over
    the wildcard. I'm such a jerk, but somebody has to play the Dr. Phil role and
    let everybody know when it's time to move on. Next I'm going to tell people they're
    fat and their relationships suck. WAH WAH. :("

<p>It's been a long time since I've posted anything. In fact, my last post was July 20. This may hurt me in my yearly performance review with IvyEnvy president and CEO, Corey. In such tough economic times I'm hoping the 2010 budget allows me to stay on staff, but I would understand if Corey's iron fist were to downsize my position. Ad revenues are down and the great state of Illinois has upped the liquor tax making it the highest in the nation. These things don't help my cause.</p>
<p>And so I return to the blog world with the following upbeat and positive message from Debbie Downer and Captain Obvious. <strong>They're not going to make it.</strong> With a 7-3 record, the past ten games have given a little fuel to the "they're still in it" and "don't give up yet" debates. As a group we at ivyeny have pretty much written off the chances of a comeback. Then, with the loss of our beloved Soriano and roster expansion the Cubs go on a tear, winning 10 of 15 in September and now sit just 6.5 games back of the wildcard leading Rockies. Whoa! 6.5 games...that's doable, right? Not really. They'd have to play even better. The Rockies have continued to play well in September with little sign of a falloff. The Rockies have 15 games remaining. If they finish one game over .500 (not likely to happen) their record will be 91-71. Just to tie, the Cubs will need to finish their 18 games at 16-2. Not an easy task.</p>
<p>This isn't pessimism talking, it's realism. I have to admit I got caught up in the thought that if they continued their winning ways they might make it. Then I did the ridiculous math above and found out my hopes were not founded in reality. I think I need to take a page from Andy's book and just watch the games for the pure pleasure of watching baseball.</p>
