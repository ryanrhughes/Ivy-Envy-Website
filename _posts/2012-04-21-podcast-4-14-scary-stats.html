    I would definitely encourage a fan approaching baseball to follow the Cubs...here's why:
    &nbsp;
    If you're going into this with no favorite team, why not?&nbsp; You might as well start now from scratch.&nbsp; You don't have any of the hangups about the 104 years because you weren't following them.&nbsp; I would think now would be the best time to get started.&nbsp;
    &nbsp;
    And, it's not like there isn't stuff to love.&nbsp; Everyone (except me) loves beer, and they love green grass on the field.&nbsp; It's aesthetically pleasing and we also have a guy (Soriano) who is on his way out and everyone loves to see somebody get fired (see "The Apprentice"

<p>Andy and Corey are not just joined by Kurt via Skype, but we have two guest hosts for this week's episode.  Brian was on the last episode and returns for this one, and long-time listener Bob from Moline joins us in the studio.  </p>
<p>Corey poses a scenario and the guys decide whether they would encourage someone discovering baseball to follow the Cubs or move on to another team.  </p>
<p>It was an ugly week of Cubs baseball and we go around and state what we believe to be the biggest area/player of concern.  Run production and the bullpen are the reoccurring answers.  </p>
<p>We also look at Starlin Castro's defense and discuss whether or not the Cubs should consider moving Castro to another position.  </p>
<p>Ryan Dempster appears to possibly headed to the Disabled List and as the most consistent pitcher on this staff in the short 2012 season, would this be a major blow to the team?  </p>
<p>The Cubs are in the middle of a brutal stretch of the schedule.  At the middle of May, the Cubs will have played 39 games.  We predict how many wins the Cubs will have with 39 games played.  </p>
<p>After the break, Kurt gives us his Scary Stat of the Week, and we pick co-winners for this week's photo caption contest.  </p>
