<p>Spring Training was just a few days old and the Cubs were already in what appeared to be meltdown mode.  We talk about Silva and Ramirez, and the errors that caused the dispute.  We also discuss how Mike Quade seemed to handle his first real test as the Cubs manager.</p>
<p>We really enjoyed your entries in our photo caption contest this week and we read them.  We will have weekly contests on our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946#!/pages/Ivy-Envy/298438948946" target="_blank">Facebook page</a>.&nbsp; "Like" our Facebook page to participate in not only the contests, but also the discussions about the Cubs.</p>
