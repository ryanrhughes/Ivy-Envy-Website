<p>In the first inning of last night&rsquo;s game, my opinion of Alfonso Soriano&rsquo;s hop was validated. I&rsquo;ve never liked it, nor have I bought the "it&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s comfortable with" excuse. To me, it seems cocky, flashy, and like something you expect to see in a sandlot game. This was something I had hoped would disappear over the off-season. Well, here we are, a little over 2 weeks into the season and he comes away limping, needing assistance to get off the field after a routine pop-fly. <a id="more"></a><a id="more-16"></a></p>
<p>At this time, results have not been released, but Piniella indicated this morning that he would be out for a while. Soriano has not been too hot at the plate this year. I don&rsquo;t think replacing him in the line-up with Reed Johnson (Avg - .310, OBP - .394 and 5 RBI) would be a detriment to the team, offensively. They won&rsquo;t bring up Matt Murton, who is batting .294, but only has a slugging average of .294 in Triple-A Iowa. Wow, not one extra-base hit after 11 games. The team is hitting the ball well enough, that I think the Cubs can survive without Soriano and his .175 batting average.&nbsp; Even if they leave Derosa in LF and put Fontenot at 2nd, I think at this point, it would be an improvement.&nbsp; The only thing we will be missing is the potential for a few solo HR's.&nbsp; He's probably the worst guy on the team when he's down in the count.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's interesting that it's possibly a good thing that the Cubs have just lost their highest paid player.&nbsp; They might just be a better team without him.&nbsp; The one thing they do lose is the threat of him throwing out a runner at the plate from shallow left field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to admit that I did not see the whole 9<sup>th</sup> inning of last night&rsquo;s game. My wife got wrapped up in a Law and Order SVU episode and I missed Wuertz&rsquo;s second straight collapse. Since I didn&rsquo;t not witness it, I can&rsquo;t really say this with absolute confidence, but with a lead like they had, I would have liked to see Lou leave him in there and work through it. It is really comforting to see Wood get his 3<sup>rd</sup> save of the season, though. I did not expect him to perform as well as he has. I can look past that 9<sup>th</sup> inning game tying HR he gave up in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Stay tuned Cubs fans. The injuries are starting to roll in. Let&rsquo;s see what this team looks like in two weeks!</p>
