<p><a href="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast.png"><img data-id="10146"  src="/uploads/2014/06/IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast-300x195.png" alt="IyvEnvy_Color_blogpodcast" width="300" height="195" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10146" /></a>Welcome to the 352<sup>nd</sup> episode of The Ivy Envy Podcast, which happens to be the last episode of the 2015 regular season.  Unlike every other "last episode of the regular season" in the history of this podcast, this is not our last episode of the season.</p>
<p>On this episode, we wrap up the regular season.  We talk about some of the big picture reasons we saw this Cubs team win 97 games.  We don't get too into Wednesday's Wild Card game in Pittsburgh because we will be doing an episode on that game Tuesday night.  </p>
<p>We answer several listener questions, we have a few Scary Stats of the Week and we can't go without Internet Muscle Flexes right now.</p>
