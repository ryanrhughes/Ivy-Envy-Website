<p>To help cover costs and fund future endeavors of The Ivy Envy Podcast, we have created a <a href="http://patreon.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a>.  If you have any questions about our Patreon campaign or any of the pledge levels, please email - corey@ivyenvy.com</p>
<p>The drawings for the Ron Santo jersey, Ernie Banks autographed baseball and Ryne Sandberg jersey will take place during the live broadcast of The Ivy Envy Podcast on 5/4/14. </p>
