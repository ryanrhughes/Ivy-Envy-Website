<p>After taking a few years off, the Ivy Envy bus trip is returning in 2015! This year, our bus trip will be on <strong>Saturday, August 8<sup>th</sup></strong> and the Cubs will be hosting the San Francisco Giants.</p>
<p><a href="/uploads/2015/01/2012-Bus-Trip-e1421693404996.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10820" src="/uploads/2015/01/2012-Bus-Trip-e1421693404996-300x270.jpg" alt="2012 Bus Trip" width="300" height="270" data-id="10820" /></a>If you're not familiar with our bus trips, we rent a charter bus for the day and leave from the Quad Cities. Details on the departure and estimated arrival times will be shared later. The Cubs have not yet set the time for this game.</p>
<p>Tickets are $125 and this covers the bus ride and your ticket for an infield reserve seat at the ballgame. Contributors to our <a href="http://patreon.com/ivyenvy" target="_blank">Patreon campaign</a> have early access and a $5/ticket discount. The Patreon pre-sale is underway. If you'd like to take advantage of the early access and the $5/ticket discount, you can support Ivy Envy through Patreon for as little as $1/month.</p>
<p>Anyone that purchases tickets by February 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;will receive a free Ivy Envy t-shirt.<br />

<p>If you've never attended one of our Cubs bus trips, they are a ton of fun. You don't have to worry about taking the train, driving, parking or walking. The bus drops us off right at the ballpark. This is the most convenient way to take in a Cubs game. Food and alcoholic beverages are allowed on the bus. We just ask for responsible intoxication as there will sometimes be a youngster or two on the bus.</p>

<p>Patreon pre-sale information will be sent to Patreon supporters. Return to this page on February 6<sup>th</sup> for regular tickets.<br />
