<p>Join us in Des Moines on May 24th to watch the Iowa Cubs take on the Colorado Springs Sky Sox (Rockies affiliate). This is our chance to watch Javier Baez and other future Cubs before they get to Wrigley.</p>
<p>We will meet before the game at <a href="http://elbaitshop.com" target="_blank">El Bait Shop</a>, which is at&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222;">200 SW 2nd St. in Des Moines. &nbsp;You can meet us there anytime after 3pm. &nbsp;From there, we will walk over to the Iowa Cubs game, which starts at 7pm. &nbsp;We have reserved a suite for this game. &nbsp;By the way, the first 1000 in attendance will receive a Javier Baez jersey shirt that night. &nbsp;</span></p>
