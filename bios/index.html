A Cubs fan since 1985, Corey has seen (few) highs and (many) lows from the Boys in Blue.</p>
<p>When he is not talking about the Cubs on The Ivy Envy Podcast, Corey helps high school students with disabilities become successful in the world of work...or he's taking care of the chickens.</p>
<p>Corey is also the coach of the Knox County t-ball team with the most pitches per plate appearance.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="/uploads/2010/02/Andy.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-9013" src="/uploads/2010/02/Andy.png" alt="Andy" width="213" height="251" /></a>Andy</strong> once taught himself to juggle because one of his favorite baseball cards featured Ryne Sandberg juggling baseballs. He has yet to move on to chainsaws because he&rsquo;s never seen Sandberg do chainsaws.</p><br />
He cried himself to sleep when Ted Lilly was traded to the Dodgers for Blake DeWitt and is currently in the market for a new favorite player. When the Cubs win the World Series, Andy is going to celebrate by juggling chainsaws.</p>

Always a follower, but not a diehard until '98. He's been all in since those days at Illinois State University watching the playoff push surrounded by Cubs fans.</p>
<p>Outside of Ivy Envy, Kurt is a graphic designer and has way too many hobbies. Brewing beer, playing banjo, golf, motorcycles, makin' stuff. But the truth is all the hobbies get set aside when it's time to play trains with his sons.</p>
