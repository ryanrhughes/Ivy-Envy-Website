<p>When we reached 100 episodes, we decided to let you in on our recording by producing our first live video episode. How do we top that? We actually invite you into the studio to watch #200 being recorded...and we make a weekend of it. </p>
<p>For an audio description of the weekend, listen to our <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/episode-4-61-quad-horsey-sauce/ " target="_blank">podcast episode #4.61</a></p>
<p>Friday - We travel to Burlington, Iowa to watch the Cubs Midwest League affiliate, the Kane County Cougars play the Burlington Bees. </p>
<p>Saturday - We'll record episode #200 in the morning. We'll head into town to Duffy's mid-afternoon to watch the Cubs play the Pirates. Duffy's is a hole-in-the-wall Cubs bar that has $3 pitchers of Old Style. After the game, we'll head back to the lake and have a fish fry. </p>
<p>Sunday - Go home.</p>
<p>This will be a camping weekend. We have plenty of room at the camp site. There's power out there and restrooms/showers in the house. In the down-times, there are 3 row-boats and a paddle boat, a dock to swim off and plenty of fish to be nabbed, if that's your thing.</p>
