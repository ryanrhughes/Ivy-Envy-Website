<p>After the 2007 Chicago Cubs playoff run, a group of guys from the Quad Cities banded together to talk about the team that had recently disappointed them in the playoffs. &nbsp;After providing "Strong Opinions and Marginal Analysis of the Chicago Cubs" through the blog for a season, in March of 2008, the Ivy Envy Podcast was started.</p>
<p>After 5 seasons and over 225 episodes of podcast episodes on the Chicago Cubs, The Ivy Envy Podcast was named one of 10 finalists in the 9th Annual Podcast Awards. &nbsp;While the award was given to the perennial winners at ESPN, it was quite an accomplishment and a testament to the Cubs fan loyalty of the listeners of the podcast to put Ivy Envy on a list next to some of the biggest names in Sports media.</p>
<p>The podcasts are posted at IvyEnvy.com and they are also available in iTunes, Stitcher and most podcasting applications for your mobile device.  The weekly episodes are broadcast live (in video) to <a href="http://ivyenvy.com/live" target="_blank">IvyEnvy.com/live</a> on Sunday evenings at 8:30pm Central.  </p>
