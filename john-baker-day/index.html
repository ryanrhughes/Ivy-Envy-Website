On July 29<sup>th</sup> 2014, Cubs back-up catcher, John Baker earned a special place in Cubs lore and Cubs fans hearts. </p>
<p>With the Cubs in an extra-innings tie with the Colorado Rockies, John Baker took the mound in the 16<sup>th</sup> inning. Baker came to the plate in the bottom of the inning, drawing a walk, and eventually scored the winning run on a Starlin Castro sacrifice fly.  </p>
<p>In celebration of this unlikely turn-of-events, Ivy Envy and Danny Rockett of <a href="http://sonranto.com" target="_blank">The Son Ranto Podcast</a> and <a href="http://bleedcubbieblue.com" target="_blank">Bleed Cubbie Blue</a> are hosting <strong>John Baker Day</strong> on the 2-year anniversary of the game. This is your chance to celebrate John Baker Day with John Baker, himself.  Join us at Nisei Lounge in Wrigleyville from 11am-12noon on July 29<sup>th</sup>, before the 1:20pm Cubs/Mariners game at Wrigley.  </p>

For the $25 admission fee, you will receive admission to this event, a limited edition John Baker Day t-shirt, a digital download card for a new recording of "The Ballad of John Baker", and one drink ticket. Proceeds from this event will go to the charity of John Baker's choosing, Cubs Charities.  </p>
